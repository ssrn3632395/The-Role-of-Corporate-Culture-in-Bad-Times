0,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,0,Claes Eliasson,Senior Vice President of Media Relations & Group Communication,EXECUTIVES,"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Claes Eliasson, and I wish to welcome you all to this somewhat unusual way for Volvo to present the quarterly report. Normally, we get to meet some of you live, but this time, we will do it purely digital. Some things remain the same, though. We will be listening to a presentation by our President and CEO, Martin Lundstedt, followed by a presentation by our CFO, Jan Ytterberg. When done, we will open up the line for a Q&A session."
1,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,1,Claes Eliasson,Senior Vice President of Media Relations & Group Communication,EXECUTIVES,"So without further ado, Martin, please go ahead."
2,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,2,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Claes, for that. And also from my side, most welcome to the presentation of the first quarter normal way of doing it. We will start with some of the highlights from quarter 1 about -- both when it comes to business and financials, and then move into current situation of how the group is handling the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in the current situation and also the actions going forward. And it will be lots of focus around our 4 Cs, as we call it: colleagues, customers, cash and cost development and mitigation activities."
3,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,3,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If we then move into quarter 1, quarter 1 did, with the exception of China, follow our estimates and plans for the different markets, mainly up to mid-March. The forecasted downturn in North America materialized according to expectations, and we did adjustments according to that as well. And Europe also developed mainly according to plan, maybe somewhat more positive actually. Also, the development of market shares was generally positive. But as of mid-March, everything has changed dramatically."
4,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,4,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But if we go to the summary of the quarter, net sales decreased with SEK 16 billion or 15%; adjusted operating income was SEK 7.8 billion (sic) [ SEK 7.1 billion ] or 7.8%, with effects related to the COVID-19 outbreak in addition to further adjustments of production and activities -- sorry, operating income was SEK 7.1 billion; and operating cash flow was minus SEK 4.1 billion."
5,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,5,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The net financial position remains strong at almost SEK 58 billion, and I will come back later on also to some important news that has been announced regarding green transformation and product renewals lately."
6,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,6,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The significant impact of COVID-19 started at mid-March with very quick shutdown of our industrial activities in Europe, followed by North and South America and many other smaller regions. Since then, the majority of our industrial system has been stopped or is still in a stop phase."
7,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,7,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Regarding the truck deliveries, we have had an impact from COVID-19 outbreak, primarily from mid- March. Supplies were actually secured from China through the quarter despite society shutdown, but supply chains were disrupted when Europe, and later on, U.S. entered into more lockdowns. The volume deliveries for trucks decreased to 23% and the decline accelerated at the end of the quarter and has continued into April. The expected downturn in North America has also affected the deliveries in the quarter, but that was already planned, both for Volvo Trucks and Mack, and adjustments for that were already done to a big extent."
8,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,8,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Volumes of construction equipment decreased with 13%, whereas Volvo 14% and SDLG with 11%. The same trend as we see for trucks in Europe and America is also valid for construction equipment with a certain time lag, whereas China and Korea have picked up to levels comparable with pre-corona outbreak."
9,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,9,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Given the extremely uncertain situation regarding both short-term supply restrictions in many parts of the world currently and also the uncertainty about the demand situation when the gradual return will start, it is not as we see it meaningful to leave any market forecast for 2020 for any region."
10,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,10,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In addition to previous guidance of declining markets in Europe and North America pre-corona, this situation has been further accelerated due to the high degree of uncertainty as we are into now. We do see that activity has returned to levels, as I said, before pre-corona in China and also Korea and also relatively good activity levels and operations in Japan. But for other markets, visibility is still very low, and the impact on demand not possible to assess. We have done this judgment, both for trucks and construction equipment, and therefore, we are not leaving any forecast for the total market. Focus will instead be to align our activity levels across the whole company to the gradual return of demand. And we will do that in a step-by-step approach, both when it comes to direct and indirect cost and activities."
11,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,11,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"This slide is more in detail explaining our -- the reason for our current judgment and why leaving a forecast is not meaningful for the time being. Fleet utilization has dropped dramatically during the last weeks and is continuing on that level also. You can see one example here from Volvo Trucks European fleet utilization. The main factor for this decrease is related to national restrictions in general, but also in industrial activities as well as transportation, meaning that there is no need or even possibility to run transports on previous levels. The development of the fleet utilization for the coming months and quarters will depend on national plans for opening up different sectors and how gradual and step-by-step this will be. And we see that effect also because we have a steeper and more pronounced decrease in countries with more severe shutdowns, such as Southern Europe, for example, in relation to Northern Europe."
12,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,12,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In addition, as we see it, it will also depend on what activity and demand levels the opening up will give when it comes to different sectors. Our current estimate is that the gradual return will be rather slow and activities in the group -- in the Volvo Group needs to be structurally adjusted. Also, the effect on the order intake on the right side here, as you can see, has been dramatic and fast."
13,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,13,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"After a somewhat better-than-expected start in January and February, primarily in Europe and international markets, the order intake took a big hit related to the outbreak as from mid-March. And the reasons are, you can say, threefold."
14,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,14,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Number one is that new orders have more or less disappeared since customers are waiting for better visibility and understanding of midterm demand on their activities, on their transports basically. They are thereby postponing both the replacement and extensions, which is understandable."
15,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,15,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And secondly, also, not only that new orders and the new order inflow but the cancellation of firm orders for the same reasons from customers."
16,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,16,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And thirdly, cancellations of certain stock orders from dealers in markets with standard specifications or longer lead times basically."
17,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,17,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So this pattern has continued also in April. And the highest priority is to get an order book with high quality for us, really containing products that customers still want to get delivered. This work is still ongoing. And the refilling of the order book and to what level and speed is currently not able to judge. And together with the uncertainty in the fleet utilization, going forward means that the Volvo Group -- that we have decided to take out forecast for 2020."
18,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,18,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As a consequence of the decline in fleet utilization and also vehicles standing completely still, for example, serving automotive industry in Europe or other examples, due to the lower business activity, they are standing still, we do expect service and part sales to be more impacted in the near term."
19,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,19,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In quarter 1, service sales was still at a reasonable level. The most visible negative impact related to COVID-19 was coming from Volvo Construction Equipment and the extensive lockdown in China during big parts of quarter 1. For the rest, we did see service activities that held up fairly well with more visible negative impact as -- from mid-March. And that goes hand-in-hand with fleet utilization as well. We continue to see the effects of this decreased utilization also in April as the general activity and transport levels have been severely disrupted. How it will develop in the coming months is as a part I have already said also depending on the gradual opening up of different countries and sectors and going forward depending on the demand level of transportation after the acute outbreak phase."
20,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,20,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Even if we expect a certain uptick for services after the lockdown periods and when important sectors, as automotive, gradually opening up, sales will be lower in the foreseeable future and highly linked to the 2 days ago, we announced the intention to form a joint venture with Daimler Truck for development and deployment of fuel cells in long-haul transport and other heavy industrial applications. The setup allows Volvo to lead the transformation of our industry into the carbon dioxide neutral society and to accomplish the Green Deal and complement the current strategies with battery-electric vehicles and other renewable fuels."
21,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,21,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are building on a world-leading fuel cell technology for heavy-duty as regards power output and durability, what we call 2 of the main factors, in a 50-50 percent joint venture that will enable then the shift by a quicker time to market, larger combined volumes and a competitive cost, which is superimportant to compete with current powertrain solutions, mainly diesel, for example, and internal combustion engines. And it is also, as we have communicated, a clear signal to other players in society to start investing in other parts of the system, such as infrastructure and supply. And the interest after the announcement has been huge and positive. So a very important milestone and landmark moving forward here."
22,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,22,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Also during this period, Volvo Trucks introduced a new range of competitive cab-over-engine trucks, covering all segments and all markets, except North America. Also in this area, reception has been very positive and will serve as an important lever when the markets are coming back. So that is also a very important investment for the future."
23,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,23,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So by that, I leave the first part of quarter 1 reporting and leave it to Jan Ytterberg for the financial metrics."
24,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,24,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Martin. Some facts around the first quarter. This was supposed to be a quarter where we could show how a downturn management looks like at Volvo. We were heading towards an operating margin of close to 10% in a quarter, where Europe was in good balance between supply and demand, whereas we cut production and reduced manning in North America in the beginning of the quarter to adjust to low level of demand for 2020."
25,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,25,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"The measures to stop COVID-19 started to affect our Chinese operations in the beginning of the quarter. That had effect, but limited effects on the group. But as from mid-March, all of our main regions and business were affected substantially, both operationally and financially. So entering a tough time, it's comforting to know that the company was in good shape for a normal downturn and that we have the toolbox in place for future challenges."
26,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,26,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"The adjusted operating income in the first quarter deteriorated by close to SEK 5.6 billion to SEK 7.1 billion, giving an adjusted operating margin of 7.8%. And the main contributors to the SEK 5.6 billion reduction were the lowered amount of vehicles and services more or less across markets and business areas affecting both the loss of top line and lower capacity utilization in production. These were effects we had as part of a normal downturn, but they turned even more negative as from mid-March."
27,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,27,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Despite SDLG being more severely hit by COVID-19 effects in the quarter, sales of SDLG machines decreased less than Volvo-branded products, which led to a negative market and product mix effect with more of compact machines in construction equipment. And on the positive side, we had some positive effects coming from raw material. These items were the main explanation behind the lower gross income of SEK 5.3 billion."
28,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,28,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"If we're moving further down into the profit and loss to the indirect cost side, we continue to have high activity level in R&D, which increased and paid out expenses by close to SEK 700 million and capitalization R&D expenses continued to be higher than the amortizations also here in the first quarter, but less positive than we saw in the first quarter last year. And on R&D, FX had a limited effect."
29,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,29,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Joint venture income was substantially lower than last year, mainly related to lower income from Dongfeng, reflecting the measures of stopping COVID-19 in China, which impacted less towards the end of the quarter, but also related to our Indian joint venture with Eicher, reflecting weak demand in general in India. And on the positive side, on the indirect cost side, we had lower selling and administrative expenses of close to 10% if we adjusted for currencies. All in all, currency had a negative impact of some SEK 300 million related and to a revaluation of net payables as the Swedish krona weakened towards the end of the quarter."
30,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,30,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"If we move over to cash and net financial position, first quarter is seasonally weak cash flow quarter where working capital is being built up off the year-end and before the strong second quarter from a delivery perspective. The same trend we're seeing here in 2020 during the first 2 months, but the strong delivery month of March in the first quarter was a disappointment as business activities came to a halt in major markets, and then especially Europe. And as a consequence, working capital impacted negatively with close to SEK 10 billion in the quarter."
31,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,31,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Besides working capital where trade payables and inventory impacted negatively by some SEK 3.5 billion each, the cash flow in industrial operation was negatively affected by high tax payments of some SEK 3 billion, mainly related to the strong results in 2019, where payments in Sweden represented the majority of this; and the capital expenditure of some SEK 2.5 billion, partly being offset by disposal of assets to financial services. All in all, we had a cash outflow in industrial operation of SEK 4.1 billion in the quarter. And the negative cash flow then was reflected in a decrease of our net cash position for industrial operation by some SEK 5 billion from end '19 to end of this quarter, down to SEK 58 billion."
32,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,32,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"The financial target for industrial operation is to have a net cash position under normal conditions, meaning with normalized working capital. When volume is decreasing, we are paying our suppliers for previous periods of production, but having a reduced cash flow -- cash inflow from customers of present volumes like we have had here in the first quarter."
33,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,33,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"In a situation like the one we have experienced so far in the second quarter when the production have been halted in all regions, except Asia, and sales have been low, the negative cash flow effect from such event will be more substantial than what we experienced here in the first quarter. Our present financial position will act as a shock absorber, giving us the necessary maneuverability and also comfort in how the financial target has been applied and respected. We have been active in the credit market as from mid- March, and that has been to improve our refinancing risks and liquidity for coming quarters."
34,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,34,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"By that, Martin, I'll leave it back to you."
35,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,35,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Jan, and then we will move into the COVID-19 situation and how the company is currently handling that and the actions moving forward. And thereby, in our continuous planning for the group, we are now region-by-region working with a road map in 5 phases with linked milestones and activities and responsibilities, as you can see here on the screen. And the main priority is to work with the health and safety situation in all different phases together with our leaders, colleagues and experts to secure, of course, a reinforced situation aligned with regulations and recommendations. And that goes across the company in all different regions and countries, depending on the situation of the outbreak. And this will continue to be the main priority and an absolute prerequisite for the execution of other activities in our way through and to exit the COVID-19 crisis."
36,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,36,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"When it comes to the business activities, we have paused the initial shock with immediate winding down of industrial activities in all regions now, and that has been done in a good order, given the very, very short notice time that we had. The organization has been doing in that regard a fantastic job since it's not only the group and our internal activities that are affected but also a lot of links to suppliers and the dealers and other business partners and customers."
37,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,37,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are currently now in the stop phase, as we have said, and we have approximately 50% of our employees in some form of temporary layoff programs around the globe. And we are now gradually moving into the restart phase in some major regions. In parallel, the work is ongoing to plan for the gradual return and different scenarios for the new normal situation. This goes, of course, for directly related volume activities in operations, in sales and services but also into the indirect areas, such as technology, IT, administration to cope with a good balance and to protect cash flow financial flexibility."
38,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,38,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are very proud to inform that our customer frontline colleagues in repair and maintenance, uptime services, call centers, Volvo financial services, parts supply, fleet management and other customer- critical activities have functioned with small or no disruptions. This is, of course, very important to serve customers since they are serving society with really society-critical activities of transporting necessary goods during this very difficult period."
39,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,39,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"A final comment on this slide, as it illustrates, the current restart phase is still to test that our supply chains can function in a good manner, but as we move further down the road here and moving to the right, it will be more and more a question and a judgment of the demand levels linked to the general economic activity. The scenario planning includes, therefore, both short-term mitigation activities as well as structural measures to cope with the new normal situation and to find the right balance between revenues and costs and also investments."
40,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,40,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So if we summarize what we have been concentrating on in March and April to mitigate the severe impact of COVID-19, we have gone through most of it. Of course, health and safety remains and will continue to remain the main priority. We have done immediate reduction of activities of spending to go down to only business-critical activities. We are continuing to have a strong focus on customer uptime, supporting society critical transport and the infrastructure development. We are now continuously adjusting activity levels to the gradual ramp-up and the new normal that will be considerably lower as we judged now and structural adjustments will be necessary. And the gradual restart of production is coming from end of April, as we can see here on the next slide. And on the right side of this slide, you can see that production is already up and running in China, Korea and Japan, so the main part of our Asian footprint. And when it comes to the gradual restart with low pace, now the main focus is on Europe and the Americas as from week 17, and just to clarify, week 17 is the week we are into now because I know that in some countries we are not talking about weeks. But just to be clear, week 17 is this week and the coming weeks after that, so we are talking about end of April and beginning of May here."
41,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,41,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"First out is powertrain and engines, gearboxes, axles. And since we have, first and foremost and most important, a small demand of firm customer orders primarily related to Penta, buses and construction equipment, for example, in Asia, and to assure deliveries to customers in those areas, but also then gradually for trucks. So we will gradually start our final assembly units for trucks in the coming weeks also to test supply chains and then step-by-step adjust to actual demand levels."
42,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,42,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So to summarize, our focus is, as I started this presentation on the 4 Cs: It is about colleagues; customers and business partners; it is about cash; and cost."
43,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,43,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For colleagues, we are making sure that the restart and gradual return is down with reinforced safety measures and procedures to enable this slow ramp-up."
44,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,44,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For customers, we are focusing on maintaining good frontline service, and in addition to that, to support financial mitigation since we are seeing increased requests for, for example, lease payment modifications in our financial services operation."
45,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,45,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For the cash part, we are working with a lot of different activities and Jan has been into that, of course, inventories, both on new and used receivables and collection of that, but also to execute on our payables to pay customers in good order and quickly adjust CapEx short and mid-term. We have a good liquidity, and we have committed credit facilities also that have been worked on from treasury with very good progress."
46,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,46,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For cost, it is, of course, a mix of short-term mitigations such as layoff programs and reduction of consultants and salaries as well as reducing OpEx to business-critical activities and also all other type of activities reduced to a minimum. Long term, we will -- and that goes both for the direct and indirect part of the company. And long term, we will structurally adjust to the new normal across the group, including research and development, IT and other development activities. And we will be firm continuing to protect the core R&D in areas where it is important for us to continue to drive the transformation of our industry, particularly into a sustainable transportation system."
47,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,47,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, I would like to say that Volvo, we are a strong company with very committed colleagues and business partners. And I would like to thank also everyone in the company and also other partners for the great and committed work and loyalty during this unprecedented period. We build on a strong foundation entering into this tough period, not at least when it comes to our product and service portfolio and outstanding relations with customers across the globe. When we eventually get through this crisis, we take confidence in the fact that our customers are active in businesses around the globe that are important to keep society functioning, and those businesses will continue to grow, not at least, both when it comes to transportation and infrastructure, and that Volvo, now our products and services are vital in building sustainable and competitive transport systems and infrastructure for the future. So we have an important role to play today and tomorrow."
48,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,48,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And in the coming quarters and especially in quarter 2 and in quarter 3, it will be extremely challenging to reduce cost with the same speed and magnitude as revenues are decreasing, and it will also, as Jan said, have a big negative impact on cash flow, depending on the balance between the inflow and outflow and how production has started in mainly quarter 2 here. But we would, therefore, have full focus on our contingency activities and continuous execution during this challenging period."
49,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,49,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And by that, actually, we close the presentation, Claes, and we open up for question and answers."
50,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,50,Claes Eliasson,Senior Vice President of Media Relations & Group Communication,EXECUTIVES,"Let's do that. Thank you very much. So operator, if you would please let the first caller come forward, please."
