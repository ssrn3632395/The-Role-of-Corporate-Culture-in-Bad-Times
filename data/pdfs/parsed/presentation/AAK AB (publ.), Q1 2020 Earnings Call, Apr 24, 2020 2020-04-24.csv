1,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,1,Operator,,,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the AAK Q1 reports 2020. Today, I am pleased to present Johan Westman, President and CEO. [Operator Instructions]"
2,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,2,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you. Good day, and welcome to the AAK Quarter 1 2020 Earnings Call. Together with me today, as usual, I have our CFO, Fredrik Nilsson, and we will present the quarter 1 results and maybe more importantly comment on the outlook going forward given the unprecedented time that we are in."
3,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,3,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We will have -- we have an agenda for today, covering a few updates from myself, covering also a coronavirus update specifically for the company as well as some business area information. Fredrik will go through a few things on the financials in the CFO update, and then we'll make a few concluding remarks. And we will leave plenty of time for questions, and I think that will be important in times like this."
4,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,4,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So with that, follow me into Page 3. First, a few highlights. Quarter 1 was another good quarter for AAK. Our good momentum from quarter 4 continued into quarter 1, and the quarter closed nicely in spite of the very volatile situation we had towards the very end of the quarter, specifically end of March."
5,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,5,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We have operating profit per kilo, our margin continues to develop very nicely. And this is really driven by Chocolate & Confectionery Fats, where we have seen a turnaround situation during the end of last year on the back of the efforts we have put into that segment or to that industry."
6,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,6,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We also have a good development continuing in Bakery as well as Plant-based Food, where we did see a doubling of both volumes and our operating profit, although from small volumes, but adding to the top -- or from a smaller base, I should say, and adding to the top."
7,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,7,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Towards the end of the quarter, we did see a sharp drop in demand with regards to the solutions that we have for what we call Foodservice, literally into restaurant, wholesale chains, airline catering, and that is a direct supply as well as an indirect supply. This includes the sectors like fast-food change around -- chains around the world. That segment saw a dramatic drop towards the end of the quarter, as you can imagine, on the back of different countries way of locking down, putting in restrictions and so forth."
8,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,8,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We continue to report also a good development in our financial structure, and we now have a reported tax operating profit, earnings per share grew by 11% and our operating profit or adjusted operating profit was up 7% year-over-year."
9,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,9,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, we continuing to Page #4. And now we turn into a more specific update on the coronavirus situation for AAK. First of all, I think we all experience at the moment, from a professional perspective and from a private perspective, how this corona situation is really impacting our day-to-day life as well as our business. Our first priority, and it will remain the first priority in this unprecedented situation, is the health and safety of our employees. This has been managed well throughout the company, and it will continue to be like that."
10,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,10,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"At the same time, we're also in a balance act, where we as a key supplier of key ingredients to the food industry, we need to continue to operate. We need to continue to supply across the globe. We are an integrated part of the food supply chain and we have very important ingredients to supply. So we have also focused heavily on our contingency plans, making sure that our inbound logistics, our operations and our outbound logistics works. So a lot of effort has also been put into place in order to secure that -- secure business continually."
11,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,11,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees, our partners, suppliers as well as customers, for all the hard work, all the hours that have been put in during that -- these last 7, 6 -- 6, 7 weeks to really make sure that we continue to operate, and it has worked very well."
12,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,12,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We're looking into the business impact and more focusing on earnings and what is the situation with regards to that. I mentioned before, Foodservice. And I'd like to lift this more to the total spectrum of supply into anything normally being consumed in restaurant, fast food chains, hotels, airline catering. That sector across the world has been impacted a lot. We, as human beings, we continue to eat, but we are now shifting more into retail, of course, with regards to the different lockdowns around the world."
13,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,13,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"But we are an integrated part of that supply chain, meaning that supply that we originally supply to direct customers in Foodservice or indirectly customers of ours selling into fast-food chains, for example, that demand has been dramatically impacted towards the end of March, and that continued into quarter 2 and forward until restrictions are lifted."
14,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,14,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Specifically in quarter 1, we also had -- it started really in China with a longer shutdown linked to the Chinese New Year. So we had a planned shutdown and we extended that, but we are now back up and running in China. Towards the end of March and continuing into Q2, we started to see disruptions in, for example, India where the lockdowns also impacted our ability to operate as well as impacting our customers. So that has been more scattered disruptions. And that is also the same for Southern Latin America, where we have seen some of our customers shutting down a week or 2 either because of not being able to operate and/or to adjust demand and a bit of destocking potentially."
15,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,15,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In a helicopter view, I think we could summarize it as significantly increased volatility, significantly increased uncertainty. On a helicopter view, we are -- the majority of what we supply, they are food ingredients into the total food supply chain. That keeps on moving on and will continue because we will have to continue to eat and consume during this situation. But at the same time, we're not immune. We do have supply into the Foodservice sector, including an indirect supply into fast-food chains and that is heavily impacted."
16,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,16,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With lockdowns and restrictions around the world, the uncertainty and the risks going forward is, of course, higher than normal. This can have an impact on our other segments as well, that goes without saying."
17,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,17,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, heading into Page #5. We have continued to move on in our M&A efforts. We managed to sign the agreement for acquiring Margaron in Russia. We're very pleased with that. Russia is an important market for AAK, specifically with regards to Chocolate & Confectionery Fats, but also with very good potential in Special Nutrition, Bakery and Dairy. With this acquisition, we are now taking a further step into Russia. Margaron is already a trusted partner to us, a toll manufacturing partner, so we know them well. But with this, we are now moving forward together. So very pleased with being able to announce that."
18,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,18,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And also, we do see a continued good momentum with regards to our M&A pipeline. There is an activity even in this unprecedented situation that we have with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. And as stated before, strategically, M&A is an important ingredient in what we do strategically going forward."
19,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,19,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, heading into Page 6, and now I'm giving a few more comments with regards to the business areas that we have. Starting off with Food Ingredients. So all in all, in quarter 1, continued nice trend with regards to our margin improvements. We are up 9% year-over-year with regards to operating profit per kilo. Good momentum in Europe. Good momentum in Plant-based Food, as earlier mentioned. And really good traction also for high-end solutions within infant nutrition, where we have added more local Chinese customers. So that is pleasing to see."
20,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,20,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"At the same time, this business area also includes the Foodservice segment that I just spoke about. So in part of Food Ingredients, towards the end of March, we did see a dramatic drop in demand with regards to restaurants, fast-food chains, hotels and so forth. And we do expect that to remain in quarter 2 and forward until restrictions are lifted. It is clear that we will see a return of demand. It will, however, be gradually. It is only when we start going out and eating in restaurants, whether this volume will start to pick up again. But it will, but it will take some time."
21,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,21,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I think it's also worth to mention that when we speak about these segments, let's take, for example, the restaurant chains -- the larger restaurant chains in the world and as well as the fast food chains. When we speak about Foodservice, we talk about the direct supply that we have with sauces, mayonnaise and so forth, bottled products into restaurants."
22,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,22,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"But we also have an indirect exposure to that when we sell to, for example, a bakery customer that is selling to retail, but also selling part of the volume into a fast-food chain. There, we also see a continued demand, but a reduction in demand due to the volumes that earlier was sold into Foodservice. So there's a bit of a scattered picture, but all in all, also the main volume, the base volume of our business continue to move on well."
23,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,23,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, turning into Page 7, Chocolate & Confectionery Fats. For those of you that have been with us over the last few years, you know that we have worked hard in order to improve our production, increasing our capacity, focusing on getting a better yield, getting the raw material in that we need going forward. That has worked out well. We communicated that in Q4. And we've started to see, in Q4, a pickup in operating profit per kilo. This trend continued. So in quarter 1 this year, we did see a year-over- year improvement of our EBIT per kilo or operating profit per kilo by 8% year-over-year."
24,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,24,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So with that, we are in shape -- in good shape to continue to grow in Chocolate & Confectionery Fats. That is in this situation a more mid- to long-term statement because we also see in Chocolate & Confectionery Fats increased uncertainty at the moment. When we look at the volume in Q1, it's flat. But then let's keep in mind that we have -- we had a really strong volume improvement last year of 13% year-over-year. So that was an exceptional growth we had in Q1 last year. So all in all, trending nicely with an improvement of margin."
25,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,25,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking into the future a little bit, the volatility within the CCF or Chocolate & Confectionery Fats segment has increased. This is a sector where we see, again, a main demand that is still there also in times of uncertainty. What we also see that government lockdowns have forced customers in Latin America, in Asia to close down temporarily, either because of their own ability to operate and/or a reduction or adjustment of volume."
26,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,26,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"This includes also that we, in times like this, see some markets opting for more low-end solutions versus high-end solutions, and we are more geared towards the high-end solutions. So we do expect to see an impact on our earnings or we can have a direct or indirect impact, negative impact on our earnings in the coming quarters, but we are still optimistic, prudently optimistic about the long-term trends for the CCF sector."
27,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,27,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to Page #8. And with that, we are into Technical Products & Feed. We have, in the quarter, seen a nice volume development. And with that, also an operating profit increase year-over-year by 6%, but this was really driven by a volume increase and a stable margin operating profit per kilo. Within this streams and have good business opportunities, but really for nonfood solutions."
28,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,28,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"These segments or industries are typically nonprioritized sectors at the moment within the current situation we have with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. So in this sector, we also see increased uncertainty, volatility. We do expect this demand to come back, but it is really impacted by restrictions country-by-country and lockdowns country-by-country where we operate."
29,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,29,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Right. With that, leaving the comments by business area and a few comments on our efforts and achievement with regards to sustainability, we just released our report on sustainability. We continue to see within -- we have developed and highlighted in this presentation, 3 areas: customers, suppliers and our planet."
30,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,30,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Starting with our customers. During the year, we launched a product range, a portfolio of products that we call AkoPlanet, made with love for people, plants and the planet. This is an umbrella brand that we launched in order to have solutions ready for Plant-based Food. Really using raw materials sourced responsibility -- with responsibility and with traceable raw materials. It is a platform where we co-develop oils and fat solutions for plant-based food meat, dairy -- or meat and dairy alternative, I should say. So I'm really happy to see this product launch or umbrella launch that we made during last year."
31,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,31,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking at our suppliers. We have continued to invest and grow our Kolo Nafaso program. The Kolo Nafaso program is a women's program supporting a sustainable development in West Africa, where we achieve or focus on equal rights to economic resources, increasing agriculture productivity, ensuring the women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership. We are engaging in women groups that help us in our supply chain, and we help them and prefinance them so that they can also improve the quality of living. And this program, during the year we have increased by 72%, and now having 230,000 women in West Africa included in this Kolo Nafaso program of AAK."
32,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,32,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking at our planet and focusing in on resource efficiency. We continue to reduce our energy consumption as well as our water consumption and also our greenhouse gases. And with this, just highlighting some of the efforts we are doing within the sustainability arena."
33,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,33,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, I'd like to hand it over to Fredrik Nilsson for some further comments on the financials."
34,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,34,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Johan. Looking at the cash flow on Page 10. We have a good EBITDA increase in the quarter of 8% or SEK 56 million. Operating cash flow, including changes in working capital, amounted to SEK 71 million in the quarter."
35,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,35,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"We have a negative working capital impact from -- in the cash flow of SEK 252 million in the quarter. This was related to accounts receivables, where we saw normal seasonality between the quarters, normally the sales in December is lower; and also the price impact from higher raw material prices. We had a rally in the raw material prices last autumn. Good inventory control combined with increased accounts payables have partly offset the increased accounts receivables."
36,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,36,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"Looking at paid tax. As Johan mentioned, we have been able to reduce the tax rate from 25% to 24%. Cash outflow from investments amounted to SEK 158 million in the quarter, it was SEK 296 million last year. But please remember, SEK 169 million last years was related to acquisitions. The CapEx this year is mainly related to regular maintenance investments and capacity increases."
37,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,37,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"If we look at Page 11 and the raw material price development, we saw a significantly increased raw material prices during the last month of 2019. That will continue to have a negative impact on our cash flow during the second quarter as well. However, we have also seen now during the first quarter, that the price on the main raw materials has more or less returned to the price levels we saw before the rally in 2019. That implies that we should expect to see a positive inflow during the second half of 2020."
38,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,38,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"As we have communicated earlier, there is normally a timeline of 6 to 9 months before we start to see the impact of changes in raw material prices in our cash flow."
39,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,39,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"Let's move to Page 12, a look at the return on capital employed. We have a return on capital employed in the quarter of 14.5%, slightly down since year-end, and that's mainly related to decreased working capital we have seen in the quarter."
40,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,40,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"Looking at Page 13, net debt. I think I will, first of all, say AAK has a very strong balance sheet. Looking into the equity assets ratio, we have 46% currently, up 1% comparing to year-end. Current debt level is SEK 3.3 billion or SEK 3.266 billion to be exact. And we have a net debt over EBITDA of 1.13. So that is also, clearly, below the average we have seen over the last 4 years."
41,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,41,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"Let's move to Page 14, a look at the loan and duration profile. As you can see here, that majority of our loans have a duration of more than 12 months, which is, of course, is the strength in this volatile world. We have total facilities of SEK 8.8 billion, where around SEK 7 billion is committed facilities."
42,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,42,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"Let's move to Page 15, a look at the FX exposure. In the quarter, we have a positive currency translation impact of SEK 17 million, SEK 7 million of those was related to Food Ingredients and SEK 10 million was related to Chocolate & Confectionery Fats. Based on the spot rates end of March, there should be a very small positive translation impact in the next quarter."
43,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,43,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"By that, I would like to hand back the microphone to Johan."
44,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,44,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Fredrik. We move on with a few concluding remarks from myself on Page 16. In times like this, what we do know is uncertainty. And with that, there is a lot of things we can all speculate in and going forward. I'll try to give a picture of our -- what we expect going forward."
45,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,45,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So when we look at AAK and our position, we can conclude that we have a global footprint. We are integrated in the -- in a global network. So our customers that we serve, within the food industry as well as outside the food industry, most often these are -- it's a global network. We are very well integrated in the total world's food supply chain."
46,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,46,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We have a broad product range. We are focused on plant-based oils and fats, but within that, we cover most sectors and industries. So with that, we have a broad product portfolio of solutions and we tap into many of the industries. That gives us the strength, that gives us stability in the current situation. But it also means that in some sectors, we do see a dramatic shift in demand like I just commented earlier with Foodservice. And also the nonfood applications that we have like candles, like personal care products and so forth. So we are not immune. We will be impacted, but the base business is really founded within the food supply chain of the world."
47,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,47,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So short to midterm, there will be negative impacts to our earnings. But at the same time, when we look into the longer-term perspective, AAK, we have a robust foundation. Fredrik just commented a bit on our balance sheet. We have a robust foundation, a strong track record, a strong financial track record and a solid balance sheet."
48,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,48,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that and being a key supplier into the food industry and Chocolate & Confectionery products, these are segments with robust demand also in times of uncertainty."
49,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,49,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, we also remain calm, and we will continue to act according to our strategy. Our strategic direction stands. And with that moving on, we continue to offer our plant-based, healthy and high-value- adding oils and fats solutions. We use our customer co-development approach."
50,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,50,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And when looking at things with a bit new perspectives as we are in times like this, we see no reason to adjust our view on the strong favorable underlying long-term trends in our markets. Thus, we do remain prudently optimistic about the future in spite of the short to mid-term impact."
51,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",Presentation,51,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And with that, the guidance that we are giving is really that Q2 and the coming quarters, high degree of volatility, high degree of uncertainty. We are not immune. We have sectors where we get hit with dramatic volume reductions until restrictions are lifted. But at the same time, these are volumes that will gradually come back, and our position is strong. So the long-term future is a future that we look at with a prudent optimistic approach. Thank you. With that, we would love to take questions. And I do expect some."
