7,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Ronnie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your families are in good health and staying safe during these uniquely challenging times. As the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, our team remains focused on protecting the health and safety of our colleagues, site staff, customers and the patients we all serve. As part of the global health care community collaborating to fight this pandemic, we are actively working with multiple customers to develop COVID-19 treatment and a vaccine. This battle requires unparalleled speed without compromising safety and regulatory requirements."
8,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Customers are reaching out to us for everything from standing up trials to targeting communications for accelerated enrollment, to crisis communications to help their organizations manage through this challenging time. We also want to thank the frontline health care professionals, including many of our own Syneos Health clinically qualified volunteers who have been ICU bound, boldly fighting the pandemic. Their bravery is incredible, and we are grateful for their work to protect us all."
9,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Lastly, before we get into the first quarter details, I want to thank all of my Syneos Health colleagues for their shared strength during this time. I'm incredibly proud of our team for living our values of challenging the status quo, collaborating to deliver solutions and exhibiting the passion to change lives, which has kept our culture resilient and strong. We believe our commitment to collaborating with customers, sites and the public health community will sustain and advance our collective efforts during this pandemic and beyond."
10,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Turning now to our financial results. Let me start by saying that despite the near-term challenges, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our business and strategy, given our robust backlog and the unique market position we have created. The momentum in our business that began to accelerate in 2019 carried over into our Q1 2020 results, and we expect it to continue to build as the impacts of COVID-19 subside. After discussing the results for the first quarter, I will take some time today to detail how we are addressing the effects of COVID-19 and the different impacts and trends we are seeing across the business."
11,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"But first, let me start with our key highlights from the quarter. First, we closed Q1 with strong net new business awards inclusive of a record first quarter for clinical, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x for Clinical Solutions, 1.07x for Commercial Solutions and 1.32x for our total company. This brings us to $5.7 billion of net awards and an aggregate book-to-bill ratio of 1.21x for the trailing 12-month period."
12,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Second, our clinical business continues to show strong performance with year-over-year growth of 8.5% or 9.2% in constant currency. Third, we remain confident in our overall financial position and liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we had $336 million in cash and $281 million of capacity available on our revolving credit facility. We expect to generate free cash flow for the remainder of 2020 and have taken proactive steps to further preserve capital and provide financial flexibility, which Jason will describe in more detail."
13,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Now going into the details of our results. We had a solid quarter overall, especially considering the rapidly changing macro environment during March. Total adjusted revenue grew 3.8% or 4.4% in constant currency, which was in line with our expectations. In addition to strong revenue growth, Clinical Solutions delivered a record first quarter of net awards, resulting in a total clinical net awards of $4.5 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.27x for the trailing 12-month period. These awards were broad-based as we continue to establish and deepen our presence in top 20 pharma through our new preferred provider relationships."
14,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"This consistency of awards flow is one of the strategic benefits of growing our share with top pharma customers. Our year-over-year clinical backlog growth accelerated to 12.3%, and our pipeline of new opportunities remains robust. We did not experience any meaningful cancellations in our clinical segment related to COVID-19, although we have seen some customers slowing award decisions or postponing start dates for awarded programs."
15,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our Commercial Solutions segment experienced a revenue decline of 8.1% compared to the prior year, primarily due to an unfavorable revenue mix and lower-than-anticipated reimbursable expenses. Although the team finished the quarter with relatively strong awards, the awards were offset somewhat by higher contemplated in our full year revenue forecast. However, they did occur earlier in the year than expected, thus impacting book-to-bill. This resulted in $1.3 billion of net awards and a book-to-bill of 1.04x for the trailing 12-month period. Our pipeline of commercial opportunities remains robust given some delays in customer decisions and increased RFP volume."
16,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"As we turn to COVID-specific commentary, protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and industry colleagues is paramount in our response. Our response is led by a Business Continuity Transition Management Office or TMO, which combines the project management discipline of the Trusted Process with our well-established transition management leadership. This group manages and monitors employee safety and our rapid and seamless transition to remote operations, all while ensuring consistent business performance."
17,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The TMO is now planning the next phase in our COVID-19 response, which is the safe return to a more traditional operating model, when appropriate. We anticipate that this will occur in phases over several months, and we will be ready to deploy our field teams and reopen our facilities in this new normal. We have also focused on sourcing personal protective equipment, establishing office cleaning and safety protocols and staging personnel to return based upon prioritization criteria. In the meantime, we will continue to comply with all appropriate protocols and government mandates."
18,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In addition to the decisive actions we have taken to protect our employees and ensure business continuity, we have also supported the public health response within our local communities. From the onset, we have extended our fight against the pandemic by engaging in public health initiatives to address acute needs in local communities where our talent and expertise can help. Let me share a few examples. Firstly, across collaborative medical and communications team created a public service educational initiative to raise awareness of the use of bi-level positive airway pressure or BiPAP machines to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation for intubated COVID-19 patients."
19,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our staff in the U.K. answered the call also in collaboration with other ACRO members to participate as volunteers to increase the level of COVID-19 testing. And as mentioned, we also enabled our clinically- qualified medical staff to practice during this time, adding further strength to the global pandemic response. We are very proud of our people and these initiatives. The wave of passion and energy within Syneos Health to help patients has been magnified with our employees and teams that are ready to do whatever they can to be a part of the solution."
20,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"With that broader context, I thought it would be helpful to detail some of the impacts we are experiencing and how we are responding. Let's start with the full-service portion of our Clinical Solutions segment, representing about 60% of our total revenues. It is important to note that over 70% of our clinical businesses comprise of essential therapeutic areas that we believe may see reduced impacts, such as oncology, rare disease and orphan diseases, and other complex disease areas where patients have limited treatment options. Our clinical teams have experienced limitations accessing investigative sites, although only about 10% are inaccessible. Of the remainder, 80% to 90% are allowing at least some level of virtual activity, and we have seen these trends continue into April."
21,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Overall, this environment primarily impacts clinical monitoring activities, which comprise about 30% of our full-service revenue. Our clinical teams have done an incredible job of transitioning to remote monitoring, taking a leadership position in partnership with ACRO, along with other virtual activities. During the second quarter, we expect to convert 70% to 80% of our site visits to remote monitoring using a highly tailored approach with additional follow-up requirements dependent upon a site's capability to provide remote access to electronic health record platforms. While site access has certainly been more limited in the heavily impacted regions such as China, Italy and Spain, we have continued to conduct at least some live site visits in these areas. We have also begun to see sites in these areas that were impacted earlier slowly resuming activities."
22,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In addition, our clinical teams have experienced delays in both patient enrollment and the start-up of new clinical trials. New patient enrollment is down significantly thus far in April, driven primarily by some of our customers taking a short-term pause to ensure patient safety and continuity within their trials. Although we are continuing to make progress on the regulatory, ethics and other work that precedes site activation itself, such that we stand ready to move quickly on the final start-up activities. In an effort to drive further billable activity, our clinical teams are accelerating recruitment in less affected regions, accelerating other billable activities such as trial master file work and reassigning staff."
23,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our clinical functional service provider, or FSP business, represents about 11% of our total revenues. These teams have seen similar impacts on their ability to access investigative sites, but that only impacts clinical monitoring services, which are about 50% of FSP revenue. It is important to note that most teams within FSP are contracted on an FTE basis, not based upon units of activity. Therefore, shorter- term disruptions are less likely to impact revenue from existing teams, particularly given their embedded knowledge of our customers' processes, studies and systems. The remainder of our FSP business comprises functions like biometrics, data management and safety, which have traditionally performed most of their work remotely."
24,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our early phase business within clinical, which represents only about 2% of our total revenue, includes the clinics that represent the small portion of our business that requires on-site operational staff. We have temporarily scaled back our clinics because we're unable to host groups of healthy volunteers due to safety concerns, and we are also seeing customers delay some of their related programs. However, our bioanalytical and translational medicine labs within this business continue to operate."
25,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to our Commercial Solutions segment, where Deployment Solutions represents the largest component at about 17% of our total revenue. In this business, we believe the nature of our customer base, the mix of the products we support and the types of health care provider locations we interact with will position our integrated services to remain an essential component of commercialization for our customers. Note that Deployment Solutions currently drives over 60% of its revenue from top 50 pharma where product portfolios are more diverse and stable. Over 80% of our Deployment Solutions field teams are supporting chronic care therapies, a category where total prescription volume has remained stable. Approximately 90% of our current call activity is in physician offices, or outside of the hospital setting where COVID-19 treatment concentration is not prevalent."
26,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"While our Deployment Solutions field teams have faced limitations on their abilities to physically visit their health care providers, or HCPs, they have quickly transitioned to virtual activities enabled by the breadth of our capabilities. Our learning solutions and engagement center teams collaborated during March to train our field reps to effectively manage virtual activities given travel restrictions, while taking into consideration the capacity of each individual office and customer preferred protocols. By mid-March, 90% of our field teams have been successfully transitioned to a virtual work-from-home environment. By mid-April, the weekly volume of our field team's virtual interactions with our HCPs have nearly matched the level of in-person interactions that were occurring prior to COVID-19."
27,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"This transition has been enabled by our investments in omni-channel capabilities over the last 2 years. We are also seeing significant customer interest in our engagement center, which is enabled with multichannels to engage customers, including telephony, video and digital tools. This interest, along with increased interest in hybrid representatives, demonstrate our customers' interest in evaluating modified commercial models. It is also important to note that our Deployment Solution field teams are similar to our clinical FSP business, in that they are primarily contracted on an FTE basis. In addition, the majority of these contracts have substantial termination notice periods of up to 120 days. While this also makes them less vulnerable to shorter-term disruptions, like an FSP, we have begun to see customers delaying the start-up of new programs and the backfilling of open positions."
28,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The communications business, which comprises about 8% of our total revenue, is more important now than ever, helping our customers communicate to their key stakeholders. A recent survey we completed of over 250 HCPs confirm their need to continue to stay abreast of new therapies and data as well as their desire for information and materials to support treatment decisions. The majority of our communication business is direct to HCPs rather than consumers or other audiences and does not include meaningful media buying revenue. We are also seeing healthy year-over-year growth in our pipeline of opportunities across communications. Like our Deployment Solutions business, the COVID-related impact has primarily been slower decisions around new business awards."
29,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Lastly, within Commercial Solutions, our consulting business represents about 2% of our overall revenue. This business already operates in a virtual work environment. So it has been largely unaffected by COVID-19. In fact, we saw continued strength across all of our consulting practice areas in the first quarter with a robust backlog of work going into April. Over 85% of our consulting business is in health care, which has proven to be more durable than the broader consulting market. Further, our practice includes commercial and medical affairs strategy, where we help customers reevaluate their launch strategy of new products given the changing environment. It also includes risk evaluation and mitigation strategy and regulatory quality and compliance practices, programs which are largely driven by regulatory requirements."
30,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, we have implemented cost reduction and cash preservation initiatives in all areas and have additional measures planned and ready to implement, if needed, which Jason will outline in more detail. We are balancing these measures with our commitment to maintain excellent delivery, quality and quickly reaccelerate any impacted activities for the benefit of our customers."
31,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Alistair Macdonald,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Now let me turn it over to Jason for more comments on our financial performance. Jason?
32,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Alistair, and good morning, everyone. In navigating the unprecedented circumstances of a global pandemic and its impact on our business, I realize and appreciate even more the importance of having a strong, resilient organization with a collaborative culture. To that end, I wanted to take a moment to thank my entire team for their incredible work to support the company and all of our stakeholders during this challenging time. After I take you briefly through our first quarter results, I will spend some time outlining the proactive steps we are taking to manage the impacts of COVID-19."
33,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As shown on Slide 4, our revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $1.16 billion, up 3.8% and up 4.4% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2019 on an adjusted basis. Slide 5 shows that our Clinical Solutions revenue grew 8.5% or 9.2% in constant currency to $874.8 million for the first quarter on an adjusted basis. The growth in Clinical Solutions revenue in the first quarter was primarily driven by higher revenue from net new business awards and higher growth in reimbursable expenses, partially offset by the impact of FX. Revenue growth was somewhat stronger-than-anticipated in our real-world and late phase business as we continue to further penetrate that market."
34,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"While clinical outperformed our expectations in January and February, we did begin to see revenue pressure in March related to COVID-19. However, our clinical team continued to focus on driving trial continuity plans and ensuring patient safety. We anticipate that we'll recover revenue for the majority of these COVID-19 related activities in the second half of the year. Moving to Slide 6, as expected, our first quarter Commercial segment revenue declined 8.1% year-over-year to $288.5 million and declined 8% in constant currency. The decline in commercial revenue during the first quarter was driven primarily by unfavorable revenue mix and slower growth in reimbursable expenses."
35,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,35,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $137.4 million, an increase of 1.8% year-over-year, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was primarily driven by Commercial Solutions' margin contraction, partially offset by Clinical Solutions' margin growth. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 for the first quarter grew by 15.3% year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense and growth in adjusted EBITDA."
36,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,36,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As it relates to guidance, given the uncertainty surrounding both the magnitude and duration of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and our customers, we will not provide financial guidance at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation, while staying in close contact with our customers and plan to provide an update as soon as possible, taking into account all the facts and circumstances."
37,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,37,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"To evaluate the expected impacts of COVID-19 on our business, we have prepared and evaluated forecasts under a variety of different scenarios. While we currently expect that the impacts to our revenue will to recover, we have developed contingency plans for alternate scenarios, should the impacts be more significant or extend further in duration."
38,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,38,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Accordingly, as outlined on Slide 8, we have implemented a number of proactive cost savings measures to minimize margin impacts, including: accelerated certain actions in ForwardBound, our margin enhancement initiatives of organizational and operating model efficiencies; delayed hiring of nonbillable headcount; reduced or eliminated third-party costs and nonessential contractors; implemented temporary salary reductions for our Board of Directors, executives and highly compensated individuals; suspended our 401(k) match; executed voluntary furloughs; and rationalized our portfolio of services."
39,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,39,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The collective impact of these proactive measures will vary based on required duration of each. We currently anticipate total cost reductions, including reduced reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses, will allow us to maintain a full year adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 13% to 14%, generally in line with our results for the full year 2019. We are prepared to extend these reductions further and institute additional more aggressive measures as needed."
40,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,40,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Further, we have also implemented measures to supplement our cash reserves and preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, including drawing $300 million on our revolving credit facility to supplement our cash reserves, delaying certain capital expenditures, pausing share repurchases, executing interest rate swaps to fixed variable rate debt at lower interest rates and renegotiating key vendor terms."
41,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,41,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet as summarized on Slide 9. During the first quarter, our operations used $38.6 million in cash flow. Although cash flow from operations is seasonally lower in the first quarter, the first quarter of 2020 was further pressured by higher vendor payments, including reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses, along with incentive compensation, partially offset by improved collections and lower restructuring and integration costs. DSO for the quarter was 50.9 days."
42,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,42,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Given the $300 million draw on our revolving credit facility in March, we ended the quarter with $336 million of unrestricted cash and total debt outstanding of $2.97 billion. Given the minimal associated costs and out of an abundance of caution, we decided to draw down incremental cash on our revolving credit facility during March. It is important to note that we have not yet experienced any meaningful working capital impacts due to COVID-19."
43,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,43,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 9 also provides an update on our debt management and capital deployment activities. We continue to focus on a balanced approach to capital deployment to drive shareholder value, which we have always highlighted. However, the uncertainty of the current environment dictates that we focus on capital preservation, while we continue to access the extent and duration of the impacts of COVID-19."
44,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,44,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"During the first quarter, we executed additional interest rate swaps with a notional value of $549.2 million to reduce the cost of our variable rate debt. The execution of these swaps also increases the portion of our debt that is effectively fixed from 36% at December 31, 2019, to 54% at March 31, 2020. We also repurchased $32 million of our common stock during the first quarter before curtailing these purchases in order to preserve liquidity. While this leaves an additional $136.3 million of repurchase capacity, we currently do not intend to repurchase any additional shares during the second quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate the program on a quarterly basis as market conditions evolve."
45,"Syneos Health, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,45,Jason M. Meggs,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24%, and we expect to maintain that rate for the full year of 2020. Given the benefit of our NOL deductions, we expect our actual net cash outlay for taxes in 2020 to be approximately $20 million. This completes our prepared remarks, and we'd be happy to answer any questions. Operator?"
