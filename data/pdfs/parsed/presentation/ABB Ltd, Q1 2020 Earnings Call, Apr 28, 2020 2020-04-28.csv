1,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,1,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Jessica Mitchell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam."
2,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,2,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Hello, and good morning to all. Welcome to ABB's First Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call and Webcast."
3,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,3,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"The press release and financial information documents were published this morning at 7:00 a.m. and can be found on our website, along with this results presentation."
4,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,4,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Following our presentation, we will open the lines for your questions."
5,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,5,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"I am pleased to introduce ABB's new CEO, Björn Rosengren. And also with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Timo Ihamuotila, who is going to present our results in more detail."
6,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,6,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to the important information regarding safe harbor notices and our use of non-GAAP measures on Slide 2 of the ABB presentation. This conference call will include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties."
7,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,7,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"And with that, let me now hand you over to Björn."
8,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,8,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Jess. And let me also say hello, and very warm welcome to everybody on the call. My start at ABB has not been exactly as I expected when I took on the challenge as being the CEO of ABB. Yes, it has been a challenging time for all of us. On the other hand, wrestling with the rapid spread of COVID-19 has given me the opportunity to understand the quality and the resilience of many of our businesses. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 has created a very tough set of trading conditions for the quarter and also for the coming months."
9,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,9,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"First, some highlights from the quarter. Order growth surprised on the upside, helped by large order, which our revenues right now, but makes us more resilient over the medium to long term."
10,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,10,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.18, which means that the orders are 18% higher than the revenues."
11,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,11,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The challenges from the COVID-19 first affected China and then spread to Europe and the rest of the world. The pandemic created a huge challenge, both to keep our employees safe and to maintaining our commitment to our customers, but also to keep our around 200 factories and operations up and running. It helped that China managed to reopen so quickly and that we could learn from the early experiences how to secure a safe working environment in all our plants. The way our teams have handled the crisis is quite an achievement."
12,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,12,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"However, supply chain challenges and mobility restrictions impacted our ability to deliver products, compete project installations and carry out services, which affected our revenues, and eventually, our operating margins in all our businesses."
13,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,13,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On a positive note, we have made very good progress with the carve-out of the Power Grids business and target to close the transaction at the end of Q2 2020 as planned."
14,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,14,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Although I took over as CEO on March 1, I was fortunate enough to be able to meet most of our key leaders as well as visit our operations in India, in the U.S. and Europe already in February before the COVID-19 restricted our ability to travel."
15,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,15,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the health and safety of our people has remained our first priority. The teams have worked very hard to maintain business continuity and to support our customers and partners around the world. The speed, agility and accountability in which our organizations have acted during the crisis is a true proof of the commitment in our workforce and power of the operating model."
16,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,16,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,The lockdown has enabled me to spend more time with our senior team discussing how we want to operate going forward. And I do look forward to sharing more thoughts around this at June 10.
17,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,17,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Needless to say, my first impression of ABB is very positive, thanks to our people and great technologies. I am confident that we will see our way through these times and emerge even stronger and continue our journey to meet our long-term financial and sustainability targets."
18,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,18,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"That having been said, let's move to Slide #5. The extraordinary macro environment can be described as very challenging. Purchasing Managers Index have plunged around the world with weaker short-cycle demand led by the automotive sector and other consumer-facing sectors."
19,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,19,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In ABB, we have seen strong large order in the transport and in part of the process industries, suggesting a bit more resilience in some later-cycle end markets. Although economic conditions began to stabilize in China during March, they have declined materially in other regions with many forward-looking indicators pointing towards a global recession of uncertain magnitude."
20,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,20,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On the supply side, although the majority of our production capacity remains intact, constraints have started to emerge in some of our supply chain. Restrictions on travel and site visits have limited our ability to provide services, which traditionally holds up better during recessions. They have also slowed down many project installations, making this economic downturn faster and more severe in character than prior recessions. We have yet to see the full effect in our results."
21,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,21,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As a leadership team, we have taken very proactive approach to address these major challenges as outlined on Slide 6. We have put health and safety at the center of our response to lead by a group steering committee and country task forces. The Board but also the Executive Committee have taken a 10% reduction in compensation during the crisis. And we are supporting the communities in which we work with both essential supplies and critical power equipment and services to the health care facilities."
22,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,22,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Operationally, we are focused on delivering critical goods and services to our customers. And we are reducing capacity, limiting discretionary expenses like travel and professional services and delaying nonessential CapEx investments. It is clear that our decentralized operating model with our businesses being more accountable are taking the message to adjust their operations quickly to meet the market demand."
23,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,23,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Let me now hand over to Timo to cover the quarterly results in more details. Please, Timo."
24,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,24,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Björn, and welcome to today's call from my side as well. On Slide 7, you can see total orders of $7.35 billion were up 1% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Revenues of $6.22 billion were 7% lower year-on-year on a comparable basis, mainly reflecting a drop in product demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at first, in China and then across other parts of the world. Mobility restrictions also constrained project delivery, systems installations and service activities for our engineers."
25,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,25,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In turn, all our businesses reported lower margins as expected. And the group's operational EBITA margin contracted 100 basis points year-on-year to 10.2%."
26,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,26,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As part of the Power Grids carve-out process, ABB has eliminated the majority of stranded costs in the continuing group. Remaining stranded costs will be resolved in 2 ways: where applicable, they will move to the Power Grids joint venture with transition service agreements; the rest are essentially dis-synergies and will be dealt through the ABB-OS simplification program."
27,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,27,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Operational EPS was 2% lower, while basic EPS of $0.18 declined 30%. The main difference between the 2 calculations comes from losses on commodity and FX hedges and from more nonoperational costs in discontinued operations. Combined, these totaled approximately $160 million in Q1 2020."
28,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,28,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"ABB's earnings also benefited from a lower effective tax rate of 19.5%, which was driven by certain tax provision releases."
29,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,29,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Cash flow from operating activities was negative $577 million, including outflows for employee incentive programs, which, in 2019, were paid in the second quarter, in addition to lower income from operations and less favorable timing of tax payments. This was partly offset by improvements in working capital management, including better harmonization of payment terms for trade payables."
30,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,30,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to Slide 8, in which ABB's regional and country order trends for the first quarter are illustrated. Order developments were strongly influenced by when and where the coronavirus appeared during the quarter. In the Americas, orders were up 2% against a tough comparable period. Robust growth was underpinned by large orders. In the United States, orders were up 2% on a comparable basis with the country not seeing COVID-19 impact until very late in the quarter."
31,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,31,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In Europe, orders were 5% higher with variable performance at the country level. Countries in Europe that were most deeply affected by COVID-19 during the quarter, for example, Italy and France, had order declines in the region of minus 20% year-on-year. In Germany, orders were lower by 4% while orders were mainly up in other Northern European countries."
32,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,32,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Last but not least, you can see orders in Asia, the Middle East and Africa were 7% lower."
33,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,33,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"China's performance at minus 16% warrants special mention. In Robotics & Discrete Automation, lost production and curtailed system installation and service activities were combined with already challenged end markets such as automotive. That business saw order declines of over 30%. In Electrification, orders were down more than 20% in spite of healthy rebound in demand in March. Motion was similarly impacted by the downturn. However, it benefited very strongly from China stabilization with stockpiling plus large order activity easing the magnitude of order decline into mid-single-digit territory. Order growth was strong in Industrial Automation, led by marine and ports and process industry despite COVID-19 challenges."
34,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,34,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"I will now provide a closer look at the first quarter performance of each of our businesses, starting with Electrification on Slide 9. Electrification's orders were 2% lower against a tough comparable, especially for focused on AMEA region. E-mobility performed well. General industrial activity was subdued as well as renewables. Buildings slowed with a significant impact in China due to COVID-19, partly offset by strong performance in Europe and the United States."
35,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,35,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Revenues were 7% lower, reflecting a tough comparison period, production outages in China and constrained project activities in distribution solutions. The order backlog ended the quarter up 9% year- on-year."
36,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,36,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Electrification's operational EBITA margin contracted 100 basis points year-on-year. A notable improvement in the margins of installation products was outweighed by incremental solar losses and lower volumes.
37,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,37,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We anticipate a tough quarter ahead with revenues reflecting clearly bigger impacts on short-cycle business from COVID-19 lockdowns, particularly in the United States. Margins are also expected to move materially lower sequentially with a sharp falloff in demand overriding cost savings and diminishing our ability to improve performance in both GEIS and installation products."
38,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,38,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Next, on Slide 10, we have Industrial Automation or IA. IA's orders grew 8% driven by large orders. Project activities in process industries, such as pulp and paper and mining as well as imports, were strong. The conventional power generation market remained weak while oil and gas, particularly shale, slowed."
39,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,39,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Revenues were 1% lower as COVID-19's impact on book-and-bill activities outweighted support from the order backlog going into the quarter. The order backlog rose 6%.
40,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,40,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The operational EBITA margin of 9.7% was 380 basis points lower. Margins were impacted by unfavorable business mix, project execution delays and mobility constraints on service activities."
41,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,41,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"While oil prices are not expected to recover significantly anytime soon, the pipeline of opportunities in the oil and gas industry has moved considerably lower. Power generation and marine and ports opportunities also looks subdued. In addition, COVID-19 is expected to continue to hurt service activities and systems installations across all business areas."
42,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,42,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Industrial Automation's revenues and margins are expected to show material decline sequentially.
43,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,43,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Let's turn to Motion on Slide 11, which delivered a solid quarter given the deteriorating backdrop. Total orders rose 8%, led by large orders, especially for rail in Europe and water and wastewater applications in AMEA. The broad-based short-cycle downturn was also mitigated by orders generated by new OEM customers where the business has successfully driven improved market share and a strong rebound in China driven in part by stockpiling."
44,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,44,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Revenues were 4% lower, reflecting a tough comparison base; lower book-and-bill, mainly in China; and select delivery constraints, which increased when India implemented quarantine measures. The order backlog increased strongly by 15%."
45,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,45,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Operational EBITA margin of 15.3% was 110 basis points lower year-on-year, hurt by lower volumes and by incremental freight costs despite aggressive and supportive cost mitigation efforts."
46,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,46,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In Q2, we expect Motion business to more fully reflect the impact of COVID-19 with revenues moving into double-digit decline and margins expected to decline sequentially."
47,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,47,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 12, we turn to Robotics & Discrete Automation business or RA. Orders for Q1 were 14% lower. The Robotics business was challenged by the sharp decline in auto and Tier 1 activities, including a standstill at several car factories worldwide and significantly lower large orders. Orders benefited from a strong performance in machine automation, driven by order conversion from prior design wins as well as stockpiling of components."
48,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,48,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Revenues declined 19% with system and service activities, particularly in China, severely curtailed by COVID-19. The order backlog was 2% lower year-on-year."
49,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,49,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Margins were impacted by lower volumes, partly mitigated by cost-saving measures. The operational"
50,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,50,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,EBITA margin of 8.8% was 240 basis points lower than the prior period.
51,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,51,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking ahead to Q2, we expect further downside from the automotive and automotive-related sectors to impact our Robotics business. Additionally, the machine automation business, which performed well in Q1, is expected to decline."
52,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,52,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In all, we expect the top line to decline by more than 30% and the margins to be severely challenged in the second quarter. We currently do not expect the picture to improve much before the fourth quarter."
53,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,53,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"That said, this highly uncertain macro environment has even more strongly highlighted the emerging long- term need for Robotics & Discrete Automation Solutions. ABB will continue to invest in R&D and will be well positioned to capture this demand once the environment starts to normalize."
54,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,54,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We will turn now to Slide 13, which provides some perspective on ABB's medium-term financial resilience. Given the uncertainties prevailing around COVID-19, ABB is not currently providing guidance for full year 2020. We have provided the usual framework for certain line items impacting the group in the appendix."
55,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,55,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In particular, for the full year 2020 period, we have lowered our Corporate and Other cost guidance to approximately $550 million from $600 million previously and reduced net financial expense guidance to around $120 million from $150 million previously."
56,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,56,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We have also revised our estimate of tax leakage from the sale of Power Grids to $200 million to $300 million in 2020 from $400 million to $500 million. Nonetheless, as noted for each of our businesses, we expect our results to be significantly impacted in the second quarter by COVID-19."
57,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,57,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking forward, while the present conditions are exceptionally challenging, ABB is in a good position to manage them and to emerge stronger when the global economy recovers."
58,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,58,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our businesses serve more than 30 different end markets. We have maintained a good regional balance, and our regional production capacity is well matched with regional demand around the globe. We have continued to transform the group under the ABB-OS operating model, which improves our ability to respond to the global downturn."
59,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,59,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our finances are sound, and ABB has a strong balance sheet. The sale of Power Grids is targeted to close end of Q2 2020 as planned, and we have access to an undrawn revolving credit facility of $2 billion."
60,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,60,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As we illustrate on the chart on the right-hand side, ABB's cash flow has proved less volatile than operational EBITA during previous challenging periods. While we understand that this shock is different, we also expect to display some of the same resilience even in the current circumstances. In all, we are confident that our liquidity needs will be well covered."
61,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,61,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our Board's confidence in the company is reflected in the 2019 dividend, which was approved by 99.8% of shareholders at our 2020 AGM."
62,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,62,Timo J. Ihamuotila,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And with that, let me pass back to Björn now to give you the bigger picture."
63,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,63,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Timo. Moving to Slide 14. I would like to highlight that while we are very focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19, our daily business activities continue wherever we can to serve our customers. We also continue to invest in R&D for the long term."
64,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,64,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"While I'm not going to describe this slide in details, it provides some color on some of the business successes during the quarter. The examples illustrates the resilience of some of our end markets and how technological innovations also contribute to sustainability, which I strongly believe remains our long-term structural growth driver despite the near-term disruptions."
65,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,65,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Summarizing on Slide 15, I want to underline that no one knows precisely when the current crisis will come to a definite conclusion. Hence, we must continue to focus on our immediate priorities."
66,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,66,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In the second quarter, we expect ABB's operations to be significantly challenged by the sharp drop in demand due to the lockdown in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, we will accelerate our efforts to manage our cost and safeguard liquidity."
67,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,67,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,The decentralization of the group is continuing as planned. And we look to complete the divestment of the Power Grids with the closing at the end of Q2 2020.
68,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,68,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"ABB remains committed to a share buyback program using net cash proceeds from the transaction. The company is planning to execute this in an efficient and responsible way, taking account of the present circumstances."
69,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,69,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The short-term outlook for our end markets is much weaker than we would like. Most markets will see the impact of the COVID-19 and some also from the fall of the oil prices. But where there are bright spots, we will continue to make the most of them, notably, in markets like logistics and warehouse automation, data centers, food and beverage, distribution utilities and railways."
70,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,70,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We will continue to respond to the current environment to mitigate the impact of our customers, shareholders and employees. At the same time, we are also thinking beyond the COVID-19 and about what sort of company we want to be long term."
71,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,71,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"I am looking forward to providing you some early thoughts on June 10, when I'm scheduled to, via a webcast, share some of my first perspective on ABB and our way forward."
72,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,72,Björn Klas Otto Rosengren,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,Thank you for your attention. We are now ready to open the lines and look forward to answering your questions.
73,"ABB Ltd, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,73,Jessica Mitchell,Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Björn. Operator, may we now have the first question from the lines, please."
