6,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,6,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The world is not only in a severe health crisis, but obviously, an economic crisis affecting businesses in hand allows us to protect liquidity and maneuver in a way others in -- other industries and other businesses cannot under current circumstances."
7,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,7,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We're now operating under 2 essential priorities: number one, to provide for the safety and security of our workforce; and number two, to provide for the liquidity and economic well-being of the enterprise and its shareholders."
8,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,8,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In the face of this pandemic, management priorities and behavior immediately shifted to the extraordinary challenges at hand. We quickly implemented contingency plans and assembled incident response teams. We assessed the risk to our business in real-time and are taking swift actions to ensure Greenbrier is defensively positioned to manage through a period that presents a range of unknown and unknowable challenges."
9,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,9,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We are safely operating, and I emphasize safely operating all our manufacturing and essential service sites, including those sites that manage over 1/4 of industry railcars in the United States and North America. Greenbrier's operations constitute essential infrastructure and essential businesses as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other U.S. and international agency -- agencies, including all stay-at-home orders issued in the jurisdictions where we operate at home and abroad."
10,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,10,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Greenbrier supports operations vital for the national transportation system, the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. We perform our functions under the statutory and regulatory authority of the Department of Transportation, Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Railroad Administration and under the Jones Act in our marine operations."
11,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,11,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Accordingly, Greenbrier will help maintain the delivery of vital goods, including food, medical supplies and fuel to communities in the United States and in all the nations that we supply around the world. We will keep our nations and those nations smoothly functioning in the railroad system."
12,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,12,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Along with the welfare of our employees, we are determined to protect the economic well-being of the enterprise during unprecedented market and economic conditions. As discussed in our earnings release today, we are laser-focused on liquidity. Our goal is to produce $1 billion in available, reliable liquidity within the remaining 5 months of our fiscal year ending in August of 2020."
13,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,13,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Before the onset of the pandemic, we had already begun to reduce the size of our manufacturing footprint due to anticipated lower levels of railcar demand and reduced aftermarket activity. Adjustments to production and staffing levels that began in September of last year continued into the second and third quarter as we idled excess capacity in North American manufacturing facilities, largely in Mexico as well as at Greenbrier Rail Services locations."
14,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,14,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Since we began this initiative, we have adjusted global operations through workforce reductions equal to approximately 20% of Greenbrier's total global workforce. These reductions now exceed 3,500 workers. Yesterday, we took steps which would add another 200 workers over time."
15,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,15,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Our colleagues who left us this fiscal year are people who each made important contributions to our success. Many have spent their entire careers in this business. They are leaving us through no fault of their own. Each affected employee is a person with a name and a family. This is a fact we never forget.
16,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,16,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We recognize that this is a period of shared sacrifice. As a result, I have taken a voluntary immediate reduction in my salary of $250,000. And for our Board of Directors, each has voluntarily reduced their cash compensation. We have frozen pay increases for members of management. Moreover, cash and earnings will automatically flow from curtailed bonus payments if we do not meet targeted performance metrics and along with the discretionary reduction that I or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors can request. All that remains to be seen, but it is an automatic relief valve for difficult times baked into a company that is well-seasoned in dealing with difficult times in a cyclical business."
17,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,17,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"This is not our first rodeo. Greenbrier's business is flexible enough to quickly adapt to changing market conditions. Our franchise is strong and we hold the position as the #1 or #2 players in 3 core markets: demonstrated by the fact that half of this quarter's earnings were generated from abroad -- orders -- I'm not -- not earnings, but orders."
18,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,18,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And of that half, about 1,000 cars are to be built in North America by a good customer in the Gulf Cooperative (sic) [ Cooperation ] Council. We have a strong experienced management team. Greenbrier, again, has navigated through difficult markets in the past. Historically, we've come out stronger as a result of our combined efforts. Not only did we recover, but we transformed and dramatically increased the scale of our business through hard work, focus, execution and diversification of our revenue stream."
19,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,19,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Although this is a stressful time no matter how the remainder of this year plays out, we know our role in the transportation industry remains vital. Beyond layoffs and other obvious reductions, we're committed to take aggressive actions to shrink Greenbrier's cost profile, its balance sheet -- to improve its balance sheet. And Lorie and Adrian will speak more to this a little later."
20,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,20,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Based on our current backlog, we were left with very little open production capacity for the remainder of both the fiscal and the calendar year. At Gunderson, our marine backlog extends through the fiscal year and the calendar year."
21,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,21,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Our backlog production -- current production rate stretches into 2021 and beyond. A large multiyear manufacturing backlog of railcar units provides one source of stability in difficult times as we operate our facilities. These long-term customers are very reliable and have virtually never wavered in fulfilling commitments even if they have to, at times, put cars in storage. All that provides resilience and a bridge to industry dynamics and economic conditions improve."
22,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,22,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In addition to the liquidity goals I mentioned, we have stress tested Greenbrier's balance sheet to our ensure -- to ensure our liquidity, and we have run very many scenarios to look at worst case. While we have suspended earnings guidance, we expect to remain profitable."
23,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,23,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We do not know nor can anyone know how this crisis will evolve and resolve. Today, this is the biggest risk we all face together. Scenarios may emerge that we cannot reasonably anticipate. But we are confident we're managing those factors within our control, and we're also to manage others through the worst of times. This means we are prepared to adapt to the new economic realities. We'll take the difficult and necessary actions to protect Greenbrier's economic base, preserve its financial stability, focus on our core business, remove essential (sic) [ non-essential ] activities and restore shareholder value for years to come."
24,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,24,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Now over to you, Lorie, for your comments."
25,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,25,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll briefly provide some additional detail on the quarter, although I have to admit that February 29, the end of our quarter, seemed like a lifetime ago. The world has shifted very quickly, and we've pivoted to respond to the shifting global landscape."
26,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,26,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Over the last 6 months, we've been rationalizing production capacity and overhead in response to anticipated levels of new freight railcar demand and reduced aftermarket activity. Demand has weakened due to macroeconomic conditions, including trade disputes; faster train speeds resulting from the implementation of PSR; and significantly lower freight rail loadings, which have dropped sequentially for almost 15 months in nearly all commodity categories."
27,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,27,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"The industry remains supported by a backlog of over 51,000 railcars, but all builders in North America have taken steps to slow production lines in 2020. It's important to note that these conditions were present, and we were adjusting capacity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the collapse in global oil markets. We continue to adjust operations as needed to ensure the long-term health of Greenbrier."
28,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,28,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And as a brief recap to the quarter, deliveries this quarter were 4,500 railcars, and we received orders for approximately 8,500 units valued over $815 million. These orders originating from international sources international commercial effort for a customer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and will be built in and service the North American market."
29,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,29,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Our backlog worldwide remained strong at 30,800 units valued at $3.2 billion. Operating performance at our ARI manufacturing facilities improved in the quarter. And our North American manufacturing group continued to perform profitably, producing high-quality railcars safely even as production rates were adjusted and demand declined."
30,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,30,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Our European and our Brazilian operations performed as expected in Q2, and order activity was strong. Notably, we received the first multiyear order in Brazil in many years. And both our European and Brazilian operations are benefiting from some rightsizing that we executed in fiscal 2019."
31,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,31,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"The continued improvement in our repair operations is a reflection of the remedial actions taken over the last 18 months. The Wheels & Parts operations benefited from their higher seasonal volumes, although volumes were pressured compared to past winters. And our leasing revenue in the quarter included externally sourced railcar syndication activity. And as a reminder, this activity causes leasing's gross margin percentage to be lower as a percentage of revenue than its typical 45% to 50% range. Excluding the externally sourced syndication activity, our leasing segment's margin percentage was 47.2%."
32,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,32,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And with respect to the business' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, all global operations are currently meeting or exceeding the CDC's recommendations. To protect our workforce, Greenbrier has implemented health screenings, including daily temperature readings, operating through split shifts, enhanced social distancing and expanded deep cleaning at all locations. We're operating under a dual mandate of maintaining business continuity alongside ensuring employee health and welfare."
33,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,33,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"As an essential business that supports global infrastructure, Greenbrier is dedicated to fulfilling its role to facilitate the continued stability of the transportation supply network. Greenbrier and its employees take the responsibility of helping to ensure the delivery of vital goods, including food, medical supplies and fuel to communities very seriously."
34,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,34,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"As you heard from Bill, in addition to ensuring the business continues to operate, we are focused on increasing liquidity. This will be accomplished through a variety of actions, including eliminating nonessential capital expenditures, aggressively reducing our overheads and general and administrative expenses and evaluating other strategic actions. We expect to come through the current crisis as stronger, more resilient Greenbrier."
35,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,35,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"As a management team, we remain confident in the long-term strategy developed with our Board of Directors but are focused on executing the near-term priorities that Bill described."
36,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,36,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Now over to you, Adrian."
37,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,37,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Lorie, and good morning, everyone.

38,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,38,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Highlights for the second quarter include revenue of $624 million and deliveries of 4,500 units, which includes 800 units in Brazil. Aggregate gross margin of 13.8%. The quarter included a contract modification payment of $9.2 million, net of tax, which strengthened our backlog and profitability. A hallmark of Greenbrier is the flexibility to find win-win solutions to our customers' needs."
39,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,39,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $13.6 million or $0.41 per share. Excluding approximately $1.7 million net of tax or $0.05 per share of integration-related expenses, adjusted net earnings attributable to Greenbrier were $15.3 million or $0.46 per share. And adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $71.6 million or 11.5% of revenue."
40,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,40,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"We successfully achieved $4.3 million of pretax cost synergies related to the ARI acquisition in the quarter and $7.1 million year-to-date. Because of the current uncertainties and shifting priorities, we are not reaffirming our synergy targets of $15 million in fiscal 2020 at this time, although we will continue to work towards this target."
41,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,41,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Total liquidity at February 29 was $620 million, which includes $170 million of cash, and we have no significant debt maturities until late 2023. As you've heard on the call already, we are working to significantly expand liquidity through a variety of actions with a target of $1 billion."
42,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,42,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"We are also in the process of examining the various governmental programs available to Greenbrier and our employees, including programs like the payroll tax deferral provision and employee-friendly modifications of existing employee plans as a result of the Cares Act. We plan to utilize these to the fullest extent possible where beneficial."
43,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,43,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Greenbrier's Board of Directors remains committed to a balanced deployment of capital that protects our business and simultaneously creates long-term shareholder value. Greenbrier declared a quarterly dividend for 24 consecutive quarters with periodic increases. Today, we're announcing a dividend of $0.27 per share, which represents a yield of 7.5% based on yesterday's closing stock price."
44,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,44,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"As announced in our earnings release, we are suspending our prior guidance for the year. Greenbrier's management team has a long history of managing through volatile times. While the COVID-19 pandemic is without precedent and has created significant uncertainty on a global basis, we remain convinced that the proactive actions we have taken so far and the planned actions we have described today will position the company for long-term strength. Now we'll open the call for questions."
