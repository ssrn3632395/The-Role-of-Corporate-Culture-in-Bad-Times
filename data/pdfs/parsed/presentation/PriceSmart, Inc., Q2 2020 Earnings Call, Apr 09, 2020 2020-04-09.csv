8,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,8,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Michael. In the spirit of not taking anything for granted, I want to thank everyone involved with this call who's made it possible to connect with our investors and our analysts so that we can inform you about our company's results for Q2 as well as tell you about our current activities."
9,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,9,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Although, we're conducting this call from remote locations, I want to welcome Michael McCleary as our official ongoing Chief Financial Officer. Michael has done an excellent job as our interim CFO since December 10, 2019. He's been with the company for 16 years, and he has extensive experience with our business and our leadership team. They say you really get to know a person's true colors in times of challenge and stress. And the events of the last couple of months have revealed many more of Michael's great qualities."
10,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,10,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So normally, I'd get right to sharing with you insights on key events that have influenced our most recent quarterly results. Our business ended the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 with strong results and good momentum. We were seeing benefits from many of the initiatives that we've been working on for the last year, and we were feeling pretty well positioned for what we thought the rest of this year would look like. Then just about a couple of weeks into our third quarter in March, the World Health Organization recognized the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic. This virus has caused a global disruption that has touched every one of us, in some manner, including our employees and members across 13 countries. So by March, it was clear to us the world had changed and our focus quickly shifted to 5 main priorities."
11,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,11,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So priority #1, first and foremost, and as always, protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and our members. And now more than ever, in the face of this pandemic; priority 2, take additional steps to ensure continued operations without disruption; priority 3, take proactive measures to protect our supply chain; priority 4, get moving quickly on key projects, especially those that could expand online capabilities and find new ways to meet member demand, which was changing in response to this virus; and priority 5, manage cash and capital resources in the face of a much, much less predictable climate."
12,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,12,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We're now into this for a little over a month. And as often happens in times of crisis and necessity, we're actually finding opportunity. We're pushing actions, new ideas and improvements that I believe will help us shape the future of our business in very positive ways. The following is a summary of some specific actions we've taken in response to the COVID outbreak. So as to priority 1 and 2, our employees, members and continued operations. We quickly off sited employees whose functions could be performed remotely with many of our key executives taking extra precautions. This was done well before government mandates, and we've been able to continue supporting all operations from off-site since approximately the second week of March."
13,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,13,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In February, we had assembled a task force representing leadership covering all aspects of our business. This leadership team is 100% on task and communicates 7 days a week. Every day, we review in detail and plan for all of the developments in each of our 13 markets. Governmental authorities in our markets have imposed or are experimenting with policies or restrictions affecting the retail sectors of our markets, and many of these have resulted in limiting access for our members and impacting our club operations."
14,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,14,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,These limitations and restrictions change day-to-day and vary from market to market. But our team stands ready to respond real-time and is nimble in finding ways to continue to serve our members while abiding by local laws and regulations.
15,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,15,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"At the club level and throughout our distribution centers, we've implemented safety protocols to protect our heroes. Our employees who are face-to-face with the public, they're on the front line providing goods to our -- that our members really need. We're taking preventative measures such as providing personal protective equipment for them. We're installing sneeze guards for the cashiers and in other member-facing areas, we've reduced or removed in club food service. We're eliminating food sampling, we're educating our employees about best practices for good hygiene, increasing cleaning and sanitizing protocols, few."
16,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,16,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,We don't allow employees to exhibit symptoms or who live with people that are showing symptoms to come to work. And we've modified our sick leave policy to make sure that people can take paid time off without any concern about being absent.
17,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,17,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We're also preparing for the unknown. We're building reserve teams who don't overlap with other employees, so that they can step in as needed. We report and are transparent with our employees, our members and the public when we're notified of a confirmed COVID case, and we follow health authority guidelines for quarantining and contact mapping. Thankfully, to date, we're only aware of a few confirmed cases among our approximate 9,000 employees, and we're really doing whatever we can to keep that number as low as possible. But we're getting prepared if circumstances change."
18,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,18,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our third focus, protecting our supply chain. Our merchandising and distribution teams are working with suppliers to make sure items are available. And by the way, I'd like to also recognize and express my gratitude to our suppliers and our vendors because we're really working together to get through the unexpected. We closely monitor inventories in our supply chain and upstream. While we've experienced some out of stocks on certain surge items, we've generally been able to maintain adequate levels on a majority of the products that our members need. But that's a dynamic situation, and we have to keep monitoring it very carefully."
19,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,19,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And we have a contingency plan, actually a couple, in place -- in the event that a country or a region of strategic importance to our inventory flow is negatively impacted by the pandemic or they're experiencing related restrictions. Our distribution centers outside of the United States, especially the Costa Rica regional distribution center has played an important role in providing optionality and reducing the risk of interruption to the flow of critical merchandise to our markets. We've placed limits on the quantity of certain key items that members can purchase such as cleaning supplies, paper products and core shelf- stable groceries so that these essential products are available to as many members as possible. And at some clubs, we've created dedicated shopping hours for our employees as well as for seniors and other individuals most at risk."
20,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,20,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our fourth focus is, of course, meeting the demands of our members. Over the last few weeks, we've expedited our adoption of technological innovation and rapidly accelerated beta initiatives that allow our members to continue to shop while reducing the need for physical contact. I'm pleased to announce that we have successfully launched our online catalog that enables our members to see almost real-time the availability of products for all clubs. Then leveraging this capability and to best accommodate our members within the restrictions, we've already launched our first click-and-go program in Costa Rica."
21,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,21,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our members can go online, look at the catalog of products in the club, order them, pay online, drive to the club and have goods placed in their car, reducing almost any physical interaction with our employees. This is being rolled out very quickly to our other markets as well."
22,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,22,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In tandem with this, we're enhancing our member experience and increasing our digital connections with our members through our new PriceSmart app, which our members seem to like, as we're seeing a rapid increase in the number of sign-ups and renewals using the app. The talent and technology we obtained through PriceSmart's acquisition of Aeropost has proven to play a very important role in enabling these capabilities in this compressed period of time. At some clubs, we also provide assisted shopping, which allows a member to order by phone for pick up or for delivery. We've increased our capacity for delivery by our own employees as well as through delivery services."
23,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,23,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In fact, in one country where retailers were ordered to temporarily close, the government granted PriceSmart permission to operate as a drive-through, to provide pre-built basic commodity bags that we call smart bags, while requiring minimum time or physical contact between the employee and the member."
24,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,24,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We're also working to deploy our workforce in a thoughtful manner, including by developing a program to teach employee skills so that they can support our efforts to provide members with additional alternative ways to shop."
25,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,25,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"PriceSmart is also working with nonprofits, including Price Philanthropies to provide these basic commodity smart bags to people in need and to support the communities in which we operate. I'm so incredibly proud of how our team has quickly adapted and is creatively responding to the challenges we're facing while preparing for what might be next."
26,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,26,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our fifth focus, cash management. Given the uncertainties surrounding the potential impact of the outbreak on our results of operations and cash flows, we are proactively taking steps to access and preserve cash available on hand. We've also decided to delay certain capital expenditures. We plan to complete the construction of our warehouse club in Liberia, Costa Rica, next month, but we postponed its opening."
27,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,27,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"With respect to our previously announced future warehouse club openings on land that we've acquired in Bogota and Bucaramanga, Colombia and in Jamaica, we've decided to suspend or not initiate the construction of those clubs for the time being. The reality is, we really don't know yet how long the situation will continue. So we've curtailed discretionary spending and are considering and planning for additional cost-saving measures in the U.S. and in the markets where we operate. You'll hear more about managing our liquidity from Michael."
28,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,28,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So now with that, let me turn to the original purpose of this call, our FY 2020 Q2 results. Total revenues were a new record for the company of $906.7 million, an increase of 6.1% over the comparable prior year period. Net merchandise sales were $871.7 million, an increase of 6.3% over the prior year period. We did benefit from the extra day in this leap year."
29,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,29,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The second quarter increase resulted from a 5.9% increase in transactions and a 0.3% increase in average ticket. Currency fluctuations in our markets had a $2.9 million or 30 basis point, 0.3% negative impact on net merchandise sales for the quarter."
30,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,30,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Comparable net merchandise sales increased by 0.4%, with currency fluctuations impacting comparable sales negatively by 0.4%. By segment, in Central America, where we had 25 clubs at quarter end, net merchandise sales increased 8.3% with a 0.1% increase in comparable net merchandise sales. The impact of currency on total and comparable sales to the Central American REIT segment was positive 1.6% and positive 1.7%, respectively."
31,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,31,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"All markets within this segment showed increased net merchandise sales year-on-year. In Panama, we opened our sixth club in May 2019 and seventh club in October 2019. And in Guatemala, we opened our fourth club in November 2019. Our comparable store net merchandise sales were negatively impacted by these 3 new club openings."
32,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,32,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In the Caribbean region, where we had 13 clubs at quarter end, total net merchandise sales grew 4.9% with comparable net merchandise sales growth of 1.3%. Our Dominican Republic and Jamaica market led the way in this segment with 17.4% and 10.5% growth for the second quarter ended February 29, 2020."
33,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,33,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In the Dominican Republic, this growth was primarily attributable to the opening of our fifth club in June 2019. While in Jamaica, strong comparable net merchandise sales growth was the primary driver of growth for the second quarter ended February 29, 2020."
34,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,34,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Jamaica, it's at a new all-time monthly sales record for the company. Their bakery alone did $1.6 million in sales in the month of December, another record, which was enabled in part by the investment we previously made to expand the club and add parking."
35,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,35,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The impact of currency on both total and comparable merchandise sales for the Caribbean segment was negative 2%. In Colombia, where we have 7 clubs, net merchandise sales grew 0.2% for the quarter, and there was a decrease in comparable net merchandise sales of 0.6%. The impact of currency on total and comparable net merchandise sales in Colombia was significant at negative 6.1% and negative 6.4%, respectively."
36,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,36,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"With regard to merchandise, in terms of consolidated merchandise categories, we experienced good growth in our fresh category, driven primarily by growth in our prepared foods, poultry and produce departments. We also saw favorable growth in departments such as pet supplies, toys, tires and sporting drinks, health and beauty as well as electronics and the appliances category within hardline."
37,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,37,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Now let's turn to membership. At the end of Q2, we continued to report very positive results. We ended the quarter with approximately 1.7 million accounts, also a new company record and a 3% increase over the prior year period. Membership income was up by 9.7% during the quarter. The growth in accounts and income during fiscal 2020 can be primarily attributed to the opening of 4 new warehouse clubs compared to last year in our Central American and Caribbean market."
38,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,38,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Membership income in our Colombian market has also been positively impacted by a 20% increase in the Diamond membership fee beginning in April 2019. Our trailing 12-month renewal rate was 86% and 85% for the periods ended February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, respectively."
39,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,39,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our Platinum membership, which offers cash back based on purchase volume in exchange for a higher annual fee represents approximately 4.5% of our total membership base and has been growing. Total gross margins this quarter increased to 16.6% from 16.1% in Q2 fiscal 2019."
40,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,40,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Gross margin when compared to the prior year period was impacted mostly by favorable net merchandise margins. Net merchandise margins for Q2 increased 70 basis points to 14.7% from 14.0% versus the same period a year ago, which is in line with our preceding 2 quarters and prior year's historical trends."
41,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,41,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 grew 7.6% to $25.6 million or $0.85 per share compared to $23.8 million or $0.79 per share in the comparable period last year.
42,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,42,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Now remember, we ended this quarter with 45 warehouse clubs compared to 41 clubs at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year '19. The new clubs include 2 in Panama referred to as Veraguas and Metropark, and 1 in the Dominican Republic, the Bolivar club; and most recently, the San Cristobal club that opened in November of 2019 in Guatemala."
43,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,43,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So now briefly turning to March sales, which we released earlier this week. Net merchandise sales were $306.1 million, an increase of 17.1% versus a year ago. FX fluctuations adversely impacted net merchandise sales by 2.5%. For the 4 weeks ended March 29, 2020, comparable net merchandise sales increased 15.7% with a negative FX impact of 3%. Although overall sales for the month of March 2020 increased significantly, driven by members stocking up primarily on food and essentials ahead of the potential shelter in place advisories."
44,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,44,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Sales did moderate and later decreased in the second half of the month. Toward the end of March, we experienced a noticeable reduction in traffic that we believe was driven by restrictive government mandates and consumer concerns about potential exposure."
45,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,45,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So to wrap up, we posted strong results for Q2 and strong sales for March. Our efforts to recommit to the Sixth Right during the preceding year was showing results on key metrics. We also recognize that a lot is changing, and there are many unknowns at this time. Therefore, it's difficult to predict when and how our members' consumption and spending patterns will adjust to a new normal. As we sit here today, we expect the impact of the pandemic and the related restrictions on our business to adversely affect traffic and sales over the next several months. And we recognize that the financial impact that COVID-19 will have on our market could also cause a downward trend in sales for some time."
46,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,46,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Having said that, we also see this as an opportunity. We've learned a lot in the last 6 weeks about what our team is capable of accomplishing. Everyone from our club and distribution center operators, to the executive team, everyone at all levels. It's nothing short of inspiring. Our team has talent, resolve, and a tremendous commitment to our members into this company, and we have loyal members who really count on us as a trusted source of goods."
47,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,47,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"A lot of families depend on us, especially in times like this. So we're treating this as a call to action. We've already covered a lot of ground and made a lot of progress on several fronts that will carry us forward long after this chapter ends. And we intend to seize on the opportunities rising from this challenge, to propel our business forward and position ourselves for the future. I'm hoping you and your families stay safe and healthy."
48,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,48,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn this over to Michael.
49,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,49,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Sherry, and good morning or afternoon to everyone in my first earnings conference call as Chief Financial Officer. First, I would like to thank Sherry, the Board and all of my other PriceSmart colleagues for their support during my interim CFO phase, which has now led to this permanent position. However, I would also like to acknowledge the difficult times we are all facing through the COVID-19 crisis and extend my heartfelt best wishes to everybody on this call today, as I imagine you all have been either directly or indirectly impacted by this crisis."
50,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,50,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"As Sherry discussed earlier, the second quarter of fiscal 2020, total revenues were $906.7 million, an increase of 6.1% and gross margins rose 50 basis points to 16.6% compared to 16.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Total SG&A as a percentage of total revenue were 12.3%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the same period last year. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by additional head count related to the opening of our 4 newest clubs and investments in talent to support our technology development and other administrative functions."
51,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,51,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Operating income was $38.8 million or 4.3% of total revenues in Q2 of fiscal 2020 compared to $36.5 million or 4.3% of total revenue for the same period last year. The improvement is largely due to higher net merchandising margins in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus the same period last year, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses due to our 4 new clubs, as indicated earlier."
52,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,52,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was essentially flat versus the prior year, coming in at 33.1% versus a rate of 32.9% a year ago. While over the last few years, we have generally provided an indication of our expectations for our full year effective tax rate, due to the current COVID- related uncertainties and projecting full year results, we are unable to provide such an indication at this time."
53,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,53,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,Net income increased 7.6% to $25.6 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.85 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $23.8 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.79 from the second quarter of last year.
54,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,54,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $136.8 million, an increase of $38.7 million versus the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities increased $12.8 million versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher net income and working capital improvements."
55,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,55,Michael L. McCleary,"Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Net cash used in investing activities increased by $31.9 million, primarily due to net increases in purchases of short-term investments and construction payments during the year.
