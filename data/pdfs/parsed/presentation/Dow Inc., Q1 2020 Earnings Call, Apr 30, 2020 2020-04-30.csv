4,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,4,Colleen Kay,Vice President of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences."
5,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,5,Colleen Kay,Vice President of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Unless otherwise specified, first quarter 2019 historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis, and all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items.

7,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Colleen Kay,Vice President of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."
8,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Colleen, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we begin, I'd like to first recognize Neal Sheorey for the tremendous role he's played in our Investor Relations team over the past 4 years. We're glad to have him leading our Coatings & Performance Monomers business. And also, a very warm welcome to Colleen Kay, who succeeded Neal as our new Investor Relations Vice President this quarter."
9,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Starting on Slide 3, I'll begin with some notable highlights from the first quarter. We delivered net sales in line with our adjusted guidance as we met strong demand in our consumer staple, nondurable applications such as food, health and hygiene, packaging and surfactants and solvents for cleaning products. Our volume, excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, declined 1%, reflecting the impact of reduced economic activity in China with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment interventions. Our volume in China was down 25% sequentially as seasonal decline due to the Chinese New Year was intensified by the sudden demand reduction due to the virus."
10,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Cash flow was again a noteworthy headline. We generated a solid $1.2 billion in cash from continuing operations, a 79% conversion of operating EBITDA to cash from operation, and our free cash flow increased by $240 million year-over-year. This was underpinned by 3 actions: one, our quick response to shifting trends in global energy prices and regional demand, which enabled us to liberate cash from working capital; two, tight capital and expense controls, including more than $30 million in stranded cost savings; and three, a nonoperational cash inflow as we recovered a $259 million tax withholding from the Canadian tax authorities related to the 2019 judgment against Nova. We ended the quarter with approximately $12 billion of cash and available liquidity, and we took further actions to reinforce our financial strength and flexibility."
11,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Early in the quarter, we opportunistically executed a EUR 2.25 billion euro-denominated debt issuance, achieving a weighted average coupon of about 1%. We immediately used the proceeds to repay debt, extend our debt maturity profile and reduce our financing costs. As a result, today, we have no major long-term debt due until the second half of 2023. And finally, we did all of this while also prioritizing returns to our shareholders. We returned nearly $650 million to owners through our industry-leading dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases."
12,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"The quarter presented us with unprecedented headwind, and we responded by flexing our operational and financial capabilities to protect our employees and facilities, meet customer demand and fortify our financial position. This brings me to our COVID-19 pandemic response on Slide 4."
13,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"I'm incredibly proud of the determination and resilience shown by the Dow team. To the many heroes on the front lines helping to ensure the health and well-being of our communities around the world, thank you. These are unique and trying times for every one of us. And it has been inspiring to see the global community rally together to help solve this challenge. The Dow team has our share of heroes as well, particularly those employees on the front line who have kept our operations running, staying close to our customers and adapting with their needs and making sure that our essential products needed around the world are still flowing from Dow plants to our customer's gate. In these challenging times, Dow people are at their very best and most resourceful."
14,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to Slide 5. Safety is always our first priority at Dow. And protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities is the first thing we did. We rapidly deployed our crisis management framework and activated site-by-site plans to maintain business continuity and secure safe, reliable operations. Today, 2/3 of our workforce is working from home, and Dow sites continue to operate with reinforced health, safety and security protocols. In fact, close to 100% of our sites are operational. In addition, our business and government affairs teams are working with federal, state and local officials and agencies to share best practices and help unlock solutions to enable the continued flow of critical goods and products as well as recommendations for how to get the economy reopened safely."
15,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to Slide 6. As an industry considered essential to global infrastructure, the chemical industry and"
16,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Dow have a critical role to play. We've remained agile by modifying our manufacturing processes and product wheels to meet increased demand for raw materials used to produce disinfectants, PPE, food ingredients and packaging. We've adapted 5 Dow sites around the world to produce hand sanitizer for donations to local hospitals and other health care organizations."
17,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And just recently, we developed a simplified face shield design to help protect health care professionals on the front line. We collaborated internally to produce and donate 100,000 face shields to Michigan hospitals, and we also made the innovative design openly available to fabricators around the world in order to help accelerate production rates of critically needed PPE globally. These are just a few examples of how Dow is utilizing our materials science expertise to combat COVID-19, which is spurring new innovation ideas for the future."
18,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to Slide 7. We understand the extreme stress that these unprecedented times placed on our communities and people, so we've committed $3 million to COVID-19 relief efforts for immediate support and to build community resilience in the recovery phase. The outpouring of support from our workforce has been inspiring. And we're giving them creative ways to provide their time and expertise above and beyond the things that they're already doing to help Dow and our customers."
19,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"I'll close my comments on the first quarter with a quick review of our segment results on Slide 8. Packaging & Specialty Plastics operating EBIT was $580 million, down from the year-ago period. The benefits of consumer-led packaging demand growth and additional stranded cost savings were more than offset by lower polyethylene and global energy prices as well as reduced equity earnings. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business delivered a 1% volume growth, supported by strong end-market demand, particularly in health and hygiene, rigid packaging and flexible food and specialty packaging applications. The business delivered volume gains in Asia Pacific versus the year-ago period despite the demand reduction in China from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic."
20,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,Hydrocarbons & Energy reported both lower volume and price. Volume declines were primarily due to reduced ethylene sales from increased internal derivative consumption.
21,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $175 million, down from the year-ago period, as demand growth in the Industrial Solutions business was more than offset by margin compression in polyurethane applications as well as equity losses. The segment also benefited from lower year-over-year planned maintenance turnaround costs."
22,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business reported lower net sales, primarily driven by lower global energy prices and decreased demand, particularly in furniture and bedding, automotive, appliance and aircraft deicing applications."
23,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Industrial Solutions reported volume growth, supported by strong demand in surfactants and solvents used in cleaning applications. Volume grew in all geographic regions, except EMEAI, which reported a modest decline."
24,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And finally, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $162 million as volume growth in coatings end markets was offset by a decline in silicones applications and local price decreases."
25,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Consumer Solutions reported demand growth in upstream siloxane and home and personal care end markets in the U.S. and Canada. However, these were more than offset by volume declines in other regions, which included the impact of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific."
26,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Coatings & Performance Monomers reported volume growth, primarily driven by increased demand in Performance Monomers. Coatings volume grew in the U.S. and Canada, led by road markings and wood coatings, but was more than offset by reduced architectural coatings demand in Asia Pacific and EMEAI, driven by impacts from COVID-19."
27,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, I want to showcase the swift and early actions the Dow management team continues to take as these unprecedented events play out. We are actively working to preserve our financial strength and flexibility while also maintaining business continuity. And so today, we're announcing another set of proactive measures, which are summarized on Slide 9."
28,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Let me be clear, Dow's operational and financial playbook have put us in a very good position. The actions we're announcing today build upon our focus to provide additional agility, drive cash generation and adjust our spending to current realities. To that end, the following near-term interventions are already underway and will gain momentum as we move through the remainder of the year. We have targeted a further $500 million release of cash from working capital. We are reducing expenses by $350 million, and we are decreasing our capital expenditures target to $1.25 billion, a reduction of $750 million versus last year. We're achieving this further reduction in a way that will maintain our long-term competitiveness and our most attractive growth projects."
29,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Also, we are taking action to idle facilities or reduce operating rates in line with demand trends in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. We're working with our customers to get orders placed with enough lead time so that we can make the best asset decisions across our network and manage bottlenecks in the supply chain to deliver product where it's needed."
30,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"In plastics, to balance production to current demand, we are temporarily idling 3 polyethylene and 2 elastomers production units for at least 30 days. The plants have an aggregate annualized capacity of approximately 2 billion pounds and are located on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Argentina. This equates to approximately 10% of the business' global annual capacity."
31,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Our polyurethanes business has strong participation in durable goods segments such as automotive, furniture and bedding, appliances and construction. These segments are being heavily impacted by government-mandated shutdowns around the world. As a result, we're running our polyurethanes assets, including propylene oxide and MDI, at reduced operating rates."
32,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And in silicones, we are running reduced rates across our global grid of siloxane trains, and our Zhangjiagang production facility in China will remain down on an extended planned turnaround into May. We also benefit from full flexibility at our silicones finishing assets, allowing us to quickly respond to demand in all formulated silicones applications around the world."
33,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"We are taking these actions with a thoughtful approach that will allow us to quickly respond as demand improves when economies around the world reopen. And while the timing and shape of a recovery remain uncertain, these actions position Dow to emerge even stronger when the global economy rebounds."
34,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"With that, let me hand it over to Howard."
35,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,35,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone."
36,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,36,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to Slide 10. I'll start with an update on a key milestone reached at Sadara. On our last earnings call, we shared that Sadara was very close to signing its final logistics service agreement. I'm pleased to report the JV has now achieved that milestone. This agreement was important as it was the final substantive step to project completion. As a result, Sadara and the JV partners have now begun the debt re-profiling process and are in parallel currently engaged in discussions with its lenders. We expect this dialogue to advance over the course of this year, and we'll provide further updates as that unfolds."
37,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,37,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"While that financing discussion is progressing, Sadara is making good progress on executing its longer- term operating structure improvements. And from this year, Dow remains on track with its planned loans to Sadara, which remain in the range of $500 million."
38,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,38,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to Slide 11. Net sales were $9.8 billion. At the company level, local price declined 8% year-over- year, driven primarily by lower global energy prices. Currency decreased sales by 1%. Volume declined 2% year-over-year, or 1% excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business. Equity losses were $89 million, primarily driven by lower results at the Kuwait and Thai joint ventures."
39,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,39,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Operating EBIT was $843 million, and operating EPS was $0.59. Positive drivers during the quarter included demand growth in food packaging, health and hygiene and cleaning applications on resilient consumer purchasing trends in response to COVID-19 as well as continued stranded cost removal. These gains were more than offset by year-over-year margin compression, notably in the polyurethanes and silicones chains as well as lower equity earnings."
40,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,40,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Overall, the financial impact of COVID-19 and the substantial decline in crude oil prices was in line with our expectation of an approximately $200 million headwind in the quarter."
41,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,41,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.2 billion of cash from continuing operations and increased our free cash flow by $240 million versus the year-ago period. Our earnings to cash conversion of 79% represented a significant improvement year-over-year. All of these metrics were helped by a solid release of cash from working capital, lower transaction costs as well as the cash inflow from recovery of $259 million from the Canadian tax authority related to the 2019 judgment against Nova."
42,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,42,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, we allocated our free cash flow in a balanced way, in line with our capital allocation priorities. In addition to the dividend, we repurchased $125 million of our own shares. Going forward, as a prudent measure, given the economic uncertainty, we are temporarily suspending our share repurchases for the balance of the year. We will, however, continue to reevaluate this lever in light of macro trends and our free cash flow generation."
43,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,43,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to Slide 12. Dow remains well-equipped to navigate the current environment and ensure our financial flexibility through the cycle. We ended the first quarter with nearly $12 billion in total liquidity, including $3.6 billion in cash and equivalents. In the first quarter, we prudently drew down $800 million on our uncommitted lines to further bolster our cash position. Recall that last year, we extended our $5 billion revolver out to 2024. And importantly, all of our more than $8 billion of committed facilities remain untapped."
44,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,44,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"With our solid liquidity position, we have clear capital allocation priorities to maximize value, ensuring safe and reliable operations continues to be our #1 priority. And financially, the dividend is our top priority, followed by additional debt paydown. In fact, over the past year, you've seen us take proactive liability management actions, including over $3 billion of gross debt reduction in 2019 and extensions to our maturity profile, and we continued this practice this past quarter."
45,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,45,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We opportunistically tapped the Eurobond market issuing EUR 2.25 billion of debt at an all-in rate of approximately 1%. We used the proceeds to repay debt and further extend our maturing profile. As a result, today, we have no substantive long-term debt maturities due over the next 3 years. These actions have also benefited earnings as our net interest expense run rate is now more than $100 million lower than 2019 and $200 million lower than 2018. As you can see, our financial strength and flexibility provides us solid foundation to navigate the current environment. And you should expect us to continue being active and opportunistic in further fortifying our financial position."
46,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,46,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Before I move into modeling guidance, I want to take a minute to discuss how we view the quarter ahead and the range of potential scenarios we're planning for. These are clearly uncertain and unprecedented times. And due to the limited forward visibility, we felt it even more critical that we provide an assessment using the best information available to us year-to-date, how the second quarter and the rest of the year could unfold and the assumptions behind our range of potential outcomes."
47,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,47,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our forward guidance is based on our expectation that virus containment will continue in the coming weeks, and the global economy will gradually and sustainably resume as industries and businesses return to work and global government stimuli take hold. The progression of containment and recovery that we saw in China is now playing out in Europe, and we expect similar patterns to evolve in the U.S. and other countries. So our corridor of potential outcomes assumes that the second quarter will show the largest global economic and chemical industry impacts from COVID-19 and the collapse in energy prices."
48,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,48,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Using China as a reference, our modeling guidance assumes recovery for Dow begins as economies reopen. Reports suggest that overall activity in China did improve quickly year-over-year in February to March, but improvements have been uneven across industries. Should the restart of the global economy be materially different than our assumptions, we intend to provide you with updates as the quarter progresses."
49,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,49,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"With that being said, let's move to Slide 13, where we highlight adjustments to the full year items we shared in January based on current realities. As Jim mentioned in his comments, our 2020 earnings should benefit from tailwinds of $350 million of expense reductions. We expect higher equity losses as our JVs also face similar trends as our core business. And we now expect a higher tax rate due to shifts in the geographic mix of earnings in our core business as well as lower equity earnings."
50,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,50,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"To preserve flexibility in this slower macro environment, we have reduced our CapEx spending target by $750 million versus 2019. We will have a cash tailwind of more than $400 million related to lower integration and separation costs for the balance of the year. And as I mentioned before, we have put further share repurchases temporarily on hold at least until we get better visibility on cash flow."
51,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,51,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Getting into the details of the quarter ahead, let's please turn to Slide 14. We see second quarter sales in the range of $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion on our assumption of demand production peaking in the second quarter with the spread of COVID-19 and slowing economic activity globally. We have outlined on the slide our current sales expectations by segment in our normal fashion."
52,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,52,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We're also providing corridors this quarter, along with high- and low-volume estimates so you understand the range of scenarios we see as possible for each segment. This is an attempt to give you a level of forward visibility in a very difficult period of forecast. Let me please reemphasize, though, these are estimates only."
53,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,53,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As usual, we're highlighting the key EBIT drivers in the quarter on a sequential basis. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, while we expect continued robust consumer-driven demand for our food, health and hygiene and packaging applications, we see this being more than offset by demand softness in automotive and infrastructure applications as well as lower average energy prices. With the dramatic shift in oil dynamics, we expect naphtha cracking to continue its advantage, which should support our European cracker margins as well as keep demand relatively resilient there. And our actions in the Americas to idle capacity should help balance supply and demand until the economies around the world reopen."
54,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,54,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, we're seeing high demand in the Industrial Solutions for our solvent and surfactants that make cleaning products effective to combat COVID-19. However, we expect that to only partly offset trough MDI spreads and weakness in end-market demand for our polyurethane products, particularly in consumer durable, construction and automotive applications."
55,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,55,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And finally, in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect demand softness for industrial applications and coatings as well as weakened fundamentals in our upstream siloxanes and acrylic building blocks, which are experiencing a challenging pricing environment on weak supply and demand fundamentals."
56,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,56,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"During the second quarter, we also anticipate we will begin to feel the positive effects of China continuing to slowly reverse the declines of the first quarter. And as the global economy continues to come back online beyond the second quarter, we also expect to see the discrete impacts related to the virus begin to reverse globally."
57,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,57,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"I'd like to just stress again that the near-term guidance you see here is based on our assumptions for how the COVID-19 containment and recovery could play out as we move through the second quarter and are based on the outlined assumptions. Given the limited visibility, we will remain strongly focused on cash flow and protecting our enterprise priorities."
58,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,58,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."
59,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,59,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 15. I want to emphasize several factors that we believe set Dow apart and support our competitive position. Given our more than 120-year history, Dow has a strong track record of successfully navigating periods of uncertainty. And as a result, we have built competitive positions and asset flexibility to be prepared for situations like those that we're experiencing today. We call these our points of distinction. And today, I will highlight a few points that set Dow apart."
60,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,60,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 16, Dow's unmatched feedstock flexibility and superior product mix are key factors that underpin the higher and more resilient margins that we deliver across the cycle. We also have a geographic mix of assets that provide a structural hedge to feedstock dynamics. For example, in today's environment, we're able to capture improved cracking margins in Europe and Southeast Asia, which offset some of the margin compression we see in other regions. We have a leading Packaging & Specialty Plastics portfolio with assets designed to be flexible and adapt to feedstock volatility."
61,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,61,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Our feedstock flexibility enables us to crack a wider mix of feedstocks. For example, we have 2 to 3x more propane capability than our peers. We can implement this at a furnace-by-furnace level in our crackers. As heavier feedstocks like naphtha become advantaged, another limitation could be co-products. If not managed adequately, ethylene units may be forced to cut rates or switch feedstock. And we've seen some signs of these strains in the industry as demand for co-products are tied to automotive and fuel end markets, which are currently experiencing weak demand. But here, too, Dow has advantages."
62,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,62,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"We have aromatics processing units in Europe and on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which give us flexibility to consume and process Thai gas from the crackers. We have capabilities of handling increased C4 streams from the cracker, which includes co-cracking to reprocess the C4 in our furnaces. In short, our feedstock flexibility and co-product management capabilities prove their worth over the cycle time and time again, and this period is no different. These capabilities preserve our low cost-to-serve position regardless of which feedstock scenario is advantaged."
63,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,63,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Further downstream, our product mix is another differentiating factor. Our mix of polyethylene and functional polymers products delivers a more resilient and higher-margin profile, which begins to stand out in softer periods like we started to see in 2019 and we are seeing today. The benchmarking we've delivered over the past 2 years has highlighted this performance as well. You can find our 2019 benchmarking data in the appendix of this earnings slide presentation and on Dow's investor website."
64,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,64,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Another point of distinction comes from the market segments that we've been targeting and the consumer orientation that we have in our products and solutions, which I'll cover on Slide 17. With our primary market verticals of packaging, infrastructure and consumer care, our business portfolio is tilted towards the consumer. And in today's situation, we find that a substantial part of our business is essential to some of the most critical end markets that consumers value."
65,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,65,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Related to the pandemic, Dow has a breadth of solutions that are in high demand. We see a strong pull in applications such as intermediates for cleaning products, pharmaceutical ingredients, packaging and nonwovens for gowns, wipes and masks, and food packaging to secure the freshness and safety of our food supply. These are moments when our materials science expertise and technologies prove their worth and play a significant role."
66,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,66,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"For example, in the pharmaceutical and health and hygiene markets alone, the following are examples of just some of the products enabled by materials science innovation and our diverse set of chemistries: silicone technologies that enable disposable gloves and tissues, detergents and hard surface cleaners, soaps and shampoos; plastics that are vital for syringes, medical tubes, vials, hoses, valves, device and pharma packaging, drapes, gloves and gowns; polyurethane solutions used for hospital bedding, rigid insulation for medicine refrigeration and transport and safety issues; coatings applications for medical devices and tapes, potable water pipes, paper food packaging and paper cups; and our Industrial Solutions team recently found an innovative way to reconfigure existing underutilized assets to increase our volume of isopropyl alcohol by up to 50%. This is a critical raw material for hand sanitizers."
67,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,67,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Out of periods of change, new ways of living, working and staying healthy are developing across the diverse markets that we serve, such as improving the performance, comfort and convenience of PPE, smart building and infrastructure solutions for multipurpose spaces, restaurant takeout food packaging, home and surface care solutions and antimicrobials. Dow's materials science know-how and strong design collaborations with customers can help enable new solutions to these developing market needs."
68,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,68,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 18, the last point of distinction I want to highlight is the global scale of our operations. This is something we often take for granted, but the year so far has emphasized just how much of an advantage it provides to our ability to meet customer demand, rapidly adjust and innovate and take advantage of with well-developed, agile, regional supply chains and a deep understanding of the needs of our customers in all of our markets."
69,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,69,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Our geographic diversity serves as a natural hedge for our business operations and uniquely positions us to shine in times of crisis and uncertainty. In fact, all of these strengths were on display in the first quarter as our teams rapidly worked through regional and global supply chain complexity, manufacturing limitations and shifting consumer trends. And as we move through the rest of the year, I see these strengths continuing to provide Dow with unique advantages. Altogether, Dow's points of distinction, unmatched feedstock flexibility, a superior product mix, participation in critical end markets and geographic diversity, set us apart and give us a competitive edge today and throughout the cycle."
70,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,70,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"In summary, Dow is prepared for what's ahead. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have plenty of liquidity to meet our obligations with no significant long-term debt due over the next few years. We continue to take proactive and thoughtful actions, both operationally and financially, with a focus on safety and cash flow, which we firmly believe will serve us well through this period. We have unique points of distinction that differentiate Dow and position us for upside when the economic recovery begins. We have a remarkable team who continues to inspire and deliver every day, and we are focused on navigating through this challenging time, emerging even stronger and continuing to execute our growth playbook. With that, I'll turn it back to Colleen to open the Q&A."
