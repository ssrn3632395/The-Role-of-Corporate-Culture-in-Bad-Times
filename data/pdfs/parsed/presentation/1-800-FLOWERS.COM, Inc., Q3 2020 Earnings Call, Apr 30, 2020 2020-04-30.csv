McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As you'll hear in our remarks today, we had a strong third quarter. Even with the challenges we face as the COVID crisis set in that impacted the last few weeks of the period. I'm proud of the way our team moved quickly to respond to these challenges from moving rapidly and enhancing the health and safety of our associates to managing our supply chain. As we enter the fiscal fourth quarter, what we have seen here is a very strong e-commerce demand, especially in our Gourmet Food brands. This demand acceleration has continued through the month of April, and you'll hear more about this later in the call this morning."
8,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Christopher G. McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In terms of the fiscal third quarter, our solid results for the period reflect a continuation of the momentum that we've seen throughout the year. The double-digit consolidated revenue growth we achieved was driven by increases across all 3 of our business segments. In our Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment, a strong 27% growth reflected continuing positive trends in everyday gifting occasions and increased self-consumption as well as contributions from Shari's Berries, which continues to perform ahead of expectations."
9,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Christopher G. McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Importantly, we saw our customer demand grow throughout the quarter and accelerate into our current fiscal fourth quarter in Harry & David, Cheryl's Cookies, The Popcorn Factory, 1-800-Baskets, Wolferman's Bakery, Stockyards, and Simply Chocolate, as customers have increasingly turned to our extensive and highly relevant product offerings to help them stay connected and express their feelings during this difficult time."

11,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Christopher G. McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"This first took the form in limitations on gathering of sympathy occasions, such as wakes and funerals. And restrictions on deliveries to hospitals for get-well occasions. Importantly, as we enter the current fiscal fourth quarter, we've seen this pattern reverse itself as customers are adapting to the new environment, and are sending gifts for these occasions and many more to their recipients' homes. As a result, we are seeing customers increasingly turn to the trusted 1-800-Flowers brand to help them express themselves and stay connected for holiday occasions such as Passover and Easter, as well as for everyday occasions."
12,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Christopher G. McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We're seeing similar patterns in our BloomNet business where we continue to grow our market share position during Q3 with solid top and bottom line results for the quarter that would have been even stronger were it not for the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Here, we are keenly focused on working closely with BloomNet's independent local florists across the country to support their businesses and help them weather the current challenging environment."
13,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Christopher G. McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Before I ask Bill to share some insights on our quarterly results and our reaffirmed guidance for the year, I think it's important to note that as we navigate these trying and uncertain times, the health and safety of our thousands of associates across the company, our BloomNet florists across the country, our suppliers and vendors, and our customers, is paramount to us."
14,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Christopher G. McCann,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We have made and continue to make necessary changes across our operations and facilities, including manufacturing, warehousing and distribution to provide for the safety and well-being of our associates while maintaining our business continuity.

18,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Chris. We are very pleased with our strong results for the fiscal third quarter and for the first 3 quarters of our fiscal year.

19,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"As Chris noted, we saw a solid e-commerce growth throughout the third quarter, including a strong Valentine's Day holiday.

20,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"As we look forward, we expect e-commerce demand trends will remain strong. With that said, there are some headwinds that will affect us in the current quarter and in the future. These include: costs associated with the closing of our retail stores that took place in March in accordance with state and local regulations. In the case of our Harry & David retail stores, we recently made the difficult decision not to reopen 38 of the 39 locations."
21,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"As an aside, our country village store in Medford, Oregon will remain open. This will result in a onetime charge in our fourth quarter for employee costs, lease obligations and other store closing costs. In addition, we have seen a reduction in our wholesale business. This will impact on our fourth quarter within our BloomNet and Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segments."
22,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, we anticipate reduced wholesale orders for the year-end holiday season as our large wholesale customers are taking a cautious approach due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19 crisis on the overall consumer economy. We have also waived certain fees to our BloomNet members for the month of April to help them weather the COVID-19 crisis."
23,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Lastly, we are seeing some increased costs associated with the changes we have made, and continue to make to our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities to provide for the safety and well- being of our associates. These include: acquired social distancing, enhanced facility cleaning and sanitizing schedules and staggering production shifts, among other changes that have an impact on our overall operating efficiencies. With that said, the strong e-commerce demand that we are seeing across our brands is offsetting the reduced revenues in these other channels as well as the incremental cost impacts."
24,"1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,William E. Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"As a result, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal 2020, which I will discuss in a moment, and we continue to see opportunities to grow our business going forward.

Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Importantly, revenue growth in all 3 segments during the quarter reflected the initial impact of the COVID-19 crisis. In Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets, e-commerce demand was up strongly at the end of March with much of the increases related to the Easter holiday, most of which shipped and was recognized in April. In Consumer Floral, before dipping at the end of March, revenues were up approximately 9% throughout most of the quarter, including strong Valentine's holiday demand.

For fiscal third quarter, corporate expense, including stock-based compensation, improved to $21.4 million compared with $25.2 million in the prior year period.

Shea,"Senior VP of Finance & Administration, Treasurer and CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Regarding guidance for the full fiscal year. As I stated earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for the fiscal 2020 full year. This reflects this continued strong growth that we have achieved through the first 3 quarters of the year, combined with the strong e-commerce demand that we have seen through the first 4 weeks of the current fiscal fourth quarter. These positive trends are more than offsetting the headwinds that I mentioned earlier."
