Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Our 15,000 associates around the world have really embraced these priorities, and I'd like to commend them for the incredible work that they've done to continue each and every day. When it comes to protecting their own health and that of their families, we've established many protocols across our operations."
8,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,8,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"We are taking precautions in our facilities to keep our people safe by aggressively cleaning and disinfecting high-touch areas, practicing social distancing and good hygiene and have been screening for COVID-19 symptoms prior to entry in all of our facilities for more than 3 weeks. As of April 7, we have been informed by 14 of our 15,000 employees that they have had at various times confirmed cases of coronavirus. In these cases, we enacted our protocols to shut down the affected location, have them thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, quarantine all appropriate -- affected people and then reopened the facilities following an appropriate shutdown period."
9,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,9,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"In terms of our communities, we are working from home, monitoring the hygiene and health of our manufacturing and distribution associates and reporting any infection or disruptions. We're also donating time and materials to help stem the spread of the virus. In one case, our Woodfinishes Group supplied thousands of plastic bottles to a local distillery that has been converting product to hand sanitizer and is providing it to free in the community, especially to health care first responders."
10,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,10,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"In another case, our Rust-Oleum operations sourced its Concrobium fogger product and donated it to first responders so that their air ambulance helicopters could be disinfected and returned to service quickly. These are just a few examples of how our operations are responding to local needs."
11,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,11,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"As one of the world's largest suppliers of specialty coatings and building materials, RPM is in a strong position to weather the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global economy. We are taking action to adjust our business activities during this period of uncertainty and are well positioned with strong cash flow, a solid capital structure and $1.1 billion in liquidity. Many of our products are used for construction, maintenance and repair projects, which are deemed essential in many cases and are relatively recession-resistant. RPM companies around the world with a few exceptions have been able to continue to operate their plants and distribution centers. In fact, today, nearly all of our North American plants are operational with a few exceptions, while a number of our international plants have been closed due to government mandates."
12,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,12,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"A large number of our North American customers such those in -- such as those in construction, infrastructure and DIY, home and hardware retail are also considered essential and currently remain open for business. With people spending more time in their homes, there is potential for increased DIY activity projects. Raw material cost inflation seems to be moderating in a number of our key product categories, our global supply chain remains strong and our distribution and operations associates continue to work diligently to meet customer demand."
13,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,13,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"We continue to be proactive in taking actions around the globe in our operations as the situation evolves. Now I'd like to discuss our MAP to Growth restructuring program. It has steadily been gaining momentum each quarter. This quarter is no different, as demonstrated by our excellent bottom line results, strong organic growth, strong earnings leverage and record levels of cash generation. Restructuring activities include enacting operational improvements at our production facilities, consolidating manufacturing plants, delayering management and rationalizing product lines."
14,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,14,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"During the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, we announced the closure of 2 additional plants, which brings our total to 20 out of the 31 plants that were originally targeted for closure at the beginning of the MAP to Growth program. Versus last year, on a consolidated basis, we realized incremental MAP to Growth savings in the third quarter totaling $21 million, of which $5 million came from manufacturing, $12 million from procurement and $4 million from SG&A."
15,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,15,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Looking ahead, as the COVID-19 pandemic slows economic and business activity, it is also impacting our MAP to Growth program. While there are some initiatives that can be carried out virtually, many, particularly those dealing with additional manufacturing improvements and the completion of our ERP to facilities have required us to temporarily halt some of our operating improvement activities. As such, we will be extending out the time line from our original MAP to Growth goals in terms of their ultimate achievement."
16,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,16,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"At this point, there is too much uncertainty to set a new date for reaching our objectives. As our markets stabilize and we gain more clarity into the business conditions, we will communicate our new MAP to Growth time line. But as you can see, once again, in our third quarter results, our people are executing on our MAP to Growth initiatives very effectively."
17,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,17,Frank C. Sullivan,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak for a detailed review of our results for the third quarter.
18,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,18,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Note that my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis. During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.17 billion, an increase of 2.9% compared to the $1.14 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2019. Organic sales growth was 3% or $34 million. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% of sales or $9 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind that reduced sales by 0.8% or $9.6 million. This was solid top line growth during the third quarter, which typically generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months when painting and construction activity is slow."
19,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,19,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23, an increase of 76.9% compared to the $0.13 in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, were up 30.4% to $60.5 million compared to $46.4 million reported in the fiscal 2019 third quarter. These excellent bottom line results were largely due to initiatives under our MAP to Growth restructuring program. Our earnings also benefited from pricing and moderating raw material costs."
20,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,20,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Turning now to our segments. Sales in our Construction Products Group were strong and increased 4.7% to $372.1 million. Growth was primarily organic at 5.1% or $18.5 million. Acquisitions contributed 1% or $3.4 million. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.4% or $5.1 million. Sales growth was driven by market share gains and the introduction of innovative new products with the fastest growth being generated in our roofing, below-grade waterproofing and concrete admixtures businesses."
21,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,21,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Adjusted EBIT in the Construction Products segment increased $6 million from an adjusted EBIT loss of $0.3 million during last year's third quarter. This improvement was largely attributed to pricing, moderating raw material costs, MAP to Growth savings and a favorable leverage impact of higher sales volume."
22,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,22,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Sales in our Performance Coatings Group were $255.7 million, up 1% from the $253.2 million we reported during last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 1.6% or $3.9 million. Sales growth in this segment was mixed as highway and bridge maintenance businesses were slowed by government budget constraints, particularly in the U.K. However, its protective in marine coatings business, unit increased market share and its Continental European operations grew sharply, driven by a new global management structure. Acquisitions added 0.2% to sales or $0.5 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind of 0.8% or $1.9 million. Segment adjusted EBIT increased 33.2% to $24.2 million from $18.2 million during last year's third quarter. A focus on higher-margin products and service offerings as well as MAP to Growth business rationalization initiatives drove a significant adjusted EBIT margin improvement of 230 basis points in the segment."
23,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,23,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"In the Consumer Group, sales were robust, increasing 5.4% to $398.7 million. Organic sales increased 6% or $22.6 million, driven by market share gains and unseasonably warm winter weather in North America that enabled consumers to complete more DIY home improvement projects. The fastest growth was achieved in our caulks, sealants, and patch and repair product lines. There was no impact from acquisitions during the quarter. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.6% or $2.2 million. Adjusted EBIT in the Consumer Group was $32.1 million, an increase of 19.2% over the prior year. This bottom line performance was driven by savings from our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan and were partially offset by inflation in certain raw materials and channel mix."
24,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,24,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"On the top line, the Specialty Products Group's wood coatings business successfully outperformed its peers in a challenging market. However, sales of the segment's water damage restoration products faced a difficult comparison to the prior year when demand was exceptionally high due to significant weather events in North America. Sales were also down in our OEM fluorescent pigments, nail polish and edible coatings businesses. Segment sales were $147.5 million. Organic sales decreased 7.1% and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.3%."
25,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,25,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"The segment benefited 3.3% or $5.1 million from acquisitions. Adjusted EBIT was $17.5 million during the quarter, which was lower than the $20.2 million of adjusted EBIT reported in the same period last year. Savings from our operating improvement program helped to mitigate the impact declining sales volume had on earnings. In addition, we have new management in place and are implementing cost- cutting measures and new processes to reignite growth."
26,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,26,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Now I'll provide some comments on our cash flow and liquidity. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2020, cash from operations grew by 162% to $381.2 million compared to $145.5 million a year ago. This increase of $235.7 million was due to improved working capital management and operating improvement initiatives. Free cash flow improved to a source of cash of $137 million during the first 9 months of fiscal 2020 as compared to a use of cash of $74.5 million during the first 9 months of fiscal 2019. This $211.5 million increase is a result of higher earnings, coupled with overall improved working capital metrics."
27,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,27,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Next, a few comments on our liquidity profile. The maturities of our long-term debt portfolio are nicely staggered with the next scheduled maturity out in November 2022, and we have multiple options for access to short-term liquidity under both our revolving credit and accounts receivables facilities. Further, in the month of February, we improved our financial flexibility and increased our liquidity by $400 million by securing 2 3-year term loans. We borrowed $400 million immediately after closing and swaps to a euro fixed interest rate of approximately 0.6%. The proceeds were used to pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility. Finally, as Frank stated, at February 29, 2020, our total liquidity, including cash and committed revolving credit facilities was $1.1 billion."
28,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,28,Matthew T. Ratajczak,VP of Global Tax & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn the call over to Rusty for details on our share repurchase program and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020.
29,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,29,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Matt. As part of our MAP to Growth program, we established the goal of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. In March, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we exceeded the halfway point of that goal when we repurchased approximately $25 million of our common shares. This is in addition to the $300 million we repurchased during fiscal 2019 and the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2020, coupled with a $200 million cash redemption of our convertible notes in November 2018. While we were making good progress on this goal, given recent macroeconomic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended our share buyback program."
30,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,30,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest and was off to a good start in March. Consolidated sales for the month increased 5% over the prior year led by the Specialty segment, which was up 9%, Consumer was up 7%, Construction Products Group sales increased 7%, and Performance Coatings Group declined 3%. However, like most companies, we expect our financial results to be impacted by the disruption and uncertainty COVID-19 is having on the global economy."
31,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,31,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Today, nearly all of our plants are open in North America, where we generate 74% of our sales. Some of our international plants have been shut down due to government mandates around the world. These facilities generate approximately 6% of RPM sales. While these shutdowns are of various durations, ranging from days to weeks, they are likely to impact our fourth quarter sales in April and May."
32,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,32,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In our Construction Products Group, demand for our innovative products and solutions has been robust, and the segment has very strong momentum behind it. Construction is on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce advisory list. The segment has a large number of hospital and health care system clients that will continue to require its offerings."
33,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,33,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"During a good sales month in March, Tremco was able to support schools during this unexpected shutdown by moving up planned roofing and other facility restoration work."
34,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,34,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"At our Performance Coatings Group, results will be mixed. We anticipate seeing a boost in sales for our hygienic seamless flooring systems. However, the portion of our corrosion control and fireproofing coatings that are tied directly or indirectly to oil and gas markets, a little more than $200 million in sales annually, may be at risk should there be a prolonged drop in pricing in those markets. So we are closely monitoring investment in this area."
35,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,35,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"POS takeaway at our Consumer Group has been strong with unit growth in the mid- to high single digits, particularly for our professional and consumer cleaning and disinfectant brands, some of which are effective against the coronavirus. The majority of the segment sales are in North America where DIY home and hardware retailers remain open for business. As consumers shelter in place, they are spending more time in their homes and have more time and interest in home repair, maintenance, improving and cleaning projects, which should continue to benefit the segment."
36,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,36,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In our Specialty Products Group, the outlook is mixed. Some of our companies, such as our marine coatings business will be slowed by the closures of their distributor and retail networks. On the other hand, Legend Brands, which manufactures cleaning products and equipment is seeing spiking demand as its restoration contractor base is shifting to disinfecting services and this trend should continue over the coming month."
37,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,37,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"According to current government projections, it appears that the COVID-19 crisis may reach its peak in April or May. This is obviously a fluid situation, and the information available to us is rapidly changing. As we sit here today, we anticipate that our consolidated fourth quarter revenue will be down 10% to 15% year-over-year. This assumes our strong March results are counterbalanced by sales drops in April and May of 15% to 20%."
38,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,38,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"With that being said, given the uncertainties around this crisis, we are withdrawing our prior earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020."
39,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,39,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We will continue to assess the situation and the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19. We are taking aggressive actions to manage cash flow by reducing working capital, capital expenditures and discretionary spending. The MAP to Growth program timing has been fortunate for us in this regard since we have improved margins and are starting to see the benefits of our working capital reduction program, resulting in improved cash flow this year."
40,"RPM International Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,40,Russell L. Gordon,VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, as Frank and Matt mentioned, we have significant liquidity and a strong balance sheet, which we anticipate will keep us in a solid financial position. This concludes our formal comments. We will now be pleased to take your questions."
