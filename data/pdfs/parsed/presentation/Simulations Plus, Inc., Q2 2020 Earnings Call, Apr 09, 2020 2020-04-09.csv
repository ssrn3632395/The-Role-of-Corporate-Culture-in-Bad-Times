The actual results of the company could differ significantly from those statements."
2,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,2,Cameron Donahue,"Hayden IR, LLC",ATTENDEES,"Factors that can cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, continued demand for the company's products, competitive factors, the company's ability to finance future growth, the company's ability to produce and market new products in a timely fashion, the company's ability to continue to attract and retain skilled personnel and the company's ability to sustain or improve the current levels of productivity."

4,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,4,Cameron Donahue,"Hayden IR, LLC",ATTENDEES,"With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to CEO, Shawn O'Connor. Shawn?"
5,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,5,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Cameron. This was certainly an eventful and historical quarter for Simulations Plus and for all of us."
6,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,6,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"I'd like to start the call by expressing my hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe in these uncertain times. While we all may be feeling a bit homebound at this point, I encourage everyone to adhere to the guidelines and precautions that keep you and your families best protected during these times. Thankfully, the impact of the COVID pandemic on us here at Simulations Plus has been relatively minimal to date."
7,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,7,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"I will elaborate on the COVID impact in our response later in the call. But first, I'd like to comment with regard to our recently announced acquisition and operating results for the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired Lixoft of the Paris, France, the developer of the highly regarded Monolix"
8,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,8,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Suite. Monolix is a PK/PD modeling platform that supports the pharmacometricians workflow with data exploration, to model fitting through to clinical trial stimulation. This acquisition did several things for us. First, it immediately expands our presence in Europe with 12 new employees and strong experienced executive management."
9,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,9,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Second, it rebalances our mix of software and consulting revenues, following 2 acquisitions of businesses that are more weighted to consulting. Lixoft's revenues are 99% annual software licenses with consistently high renewal rates, which we believe will benefit from our sales and marketing channels. Third, Lixoft has historically turned away consulting opportunities, and we believe that we will be able to respond to this market opportunity with our consulting resources, creating a new source of revenue."
10,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,10,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"And finally, the acquisition is immediately accretive with revenue growth performance in our target of 15% to 20% revenue growth and operating and EBITDA margins that exceed our existing performance. I welcome Jérôme Kalifa, Lixoft's Cofounder and Chairman; and Jonathan Chauvin, Lixoft's Chief Executive Officer to our executive management team, and I also welcome the whole Lixoft team to the Simulations Plus family."
11,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,11,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"With regard to our operating results, Simulations Plus delivered another strong quarter of execution. As you may recall, our stated goal was to deliver organic revenue growth of 15% to 20%. And once again, we exceeded this goal with 22% growth. This was our third consecutive quarter with revenue growth in excess of 20%. Our software revenues grew 12%, in line with prior periods. These strong results were achieved despite lower-than-anticipated new license business from our Asian distributors, where COVID impact was first being felt in February. Specifically, we saw about $200,000 to $300,000 of new business in Asia slipped out of the second quarter, more with regard to COVID dilemma."
12,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,12,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Our service revenue growth was strong across each of our divisions coming in overall at 35% growth. The Lancaster team is busy with many collaborations we have announced over the past several months. Cognigen is operating at capacity with full backlog, and DILIsym grew this quarter at 45%, down from their 89% growth in the first quarter, but still excellent and more in line with our capacity. Our gross margins improved to 74% overall, benefiting from a seasonally higher software quarter."
13,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,13,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Our mix was 52% software with margins of 85% and 48% consultant with margins of 63%. Net income to EBITDA as a percentage of revenue were generally within historical levels, but impacted by onetime transaction expenses related to the Lixoft acquisition. John will speak to these in detail later in the call. Let me now speak in more detail to the impact of COVID on our business."
14,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,14,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Operationally, about 40% of our workforce already worked remotely, and nearly everyone was equipped to do so. As a result, the transition to 100% working from home has gone quite smoothly. Indeed, our entire workforce is now working remotely, and productivity is essentially unchanged. Our industry has seen the cancellation of most conferences. We are conducting trainings and workshops virtually, and we have transitioned sales activities from face-to-face meetings to virtual meetings. We even completed an acquisition this quarter remotely. I believe and early results reinforce that Simulations Plus is well positioned to weather this storm compared to other companies."
15,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,15,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We have a strong balance sheet with ample cash, we've generated years of consistent profitability, and we exercise prudent expense management. Even after the use of cash to complete the Lixoft acquisition, our cash position of approximately $8 million is adequate and exceeds our cash position subsequent to our 2 previous acquisitions."
16,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,16,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We recently secured a line of credit, not out of cash flow concerns, but rather as a minimal cost insurance policy. Rates for such facilities are excellent, cost to put them in place is minimal, and there is no fee related to unused credit during the term of the line of credit. The line of credit serves as an insurance should the need arise in the future. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenues comes from the renewal of software on annual licenses with very high renewal rates. Lixoft operates on a similar model with renewal rates that are very similar to ours. So the acquisition further bolsters our recurring revenue."
17,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,17,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We have seen no impact to date on renewal rates. Finally, our service business operates off a large undertaken a detailed review combined with ongoing interactions with our clients and have identified less than 10% of the backlog at risk of delay or cancellation at this time, but we continue to monitor this status."
18,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,18,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Where we have seen impact is in the securing of new business at historical rates. I previously mentioned that we saw $200,000 to $300,000 in new software licenses -- excuse me, in Asia, slipped out into the second quarter. Asia continues to be impacted, where in some regions, infrastructure for work at home is not as robust as our experience here in the States. That said, this important -- this impact on new license sales is felt not just in Asia, but in all geographies. Thus far, we've seen no measurable decrease in demand, however, buying decisions are being delayed as companies wait for clarity into the economic impact of the pandemic, changes to their development plans and investments, and visibility into when the stay-at-home situations will begin to abate. We continue to close new software license business but at slower than historical pace. As a result, our new software pipeline is growing."
19,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,19,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"With regard to our service business, we also see a slowdown in closure of new business. As you know, our work with clients is sometimes in support of new clinical trials or post analysis of clinical trial performance, which in today's environment has been stalled. The direct development industry has focused its attention on COVID-related programs, is managing the disruptive impact on currently active clinical trials and evaluating existing plans for future clinical trials and programs in general."
20,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,20,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Further, lab facilities integral to testing have been disrupted, impacting the generation of data available for analysis. All without certainty as to when the work environment will return to normal. New business discussions continue, but at a slow and cautious pace. We continue to close new service business but at a pace behind historical levels. Similar to our software business, our new business pipeline is growing."
21,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,21,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On a positive note, we have recently initiated 2 new service offerings, which add to our new service opportunities. First, a global regulatory strategies offering, StrategiesPlus, led by a significant new addition to the team from the FDA. And secondly, the StrategiesPlus COVID ACT Program to speed consulting assistance to any organization involved in the coronavirus research."
22,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,22,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As part of this initiative, each division of Simulations Plus has identified COVID-related product applications and services to provide specialized expertise, which will contribute to developing safe and effective treatments. These 2 new service offerings and the addition of the Lixoft software revenue stream, and the potential for Monolix-based consulting service agreements, all represent incremental revenue opportunities introduced in the last quarter. All positives for the future. Nonetheless, the near- term is dependent upon the uncertainties of the COVID impact in terms of the timing and nature of our clients' go-forward plans."
23,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,23,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In summary, our business is faring better than most in today's COVID environment. We are strong financially, able to continue our support of clients with minimal impact and enjoy high recurring software revenue -- renewal revenues and a good backlog of service business. The current environment, for which there is no easy means to estimate when will we return to normal, is impacting new business cycles that have been mostly deferred and not lost."
24,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,24,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Before I turn the call over to John, let me speak briefly about the performance of our division. At our Lancaster division, revenue was up 18% for the quarter. Breaking this down, our revenue from -- came 71% from renewals, 16% from new sales and 13% from consulting services."
25,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,25,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In our software business, renewals were 88% by account and 94% based on fees, and we have generated 11% year-over-year growth in new licensing units. We added 12 new commercial companies, including new licenses in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Brazil. And we also expanded our presence with nonprofits, research groups, academic institutions, and regulatory agencies."
26,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,26,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We are engaged in projects with 19 companies and 10 funded collaborations. Operationally, we continue to advance our industry-leading software. As previously referred to, we welcome on board, Sandra Suarez- Sharp as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Sandra comes to us after a 10-year career at the FDA, where she was most recently master reviewer and scientific adviser for the division of Biopharmaceutics. We ended the quarter with 44 full-time employees at our Lancaster division, up 3 from 41 in the prior quarter and up 6 from 38 last year."
27,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,27,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"At our Buffalo division, revenue was up 20% for the quarter. We signed 21 contracts and initiated 14 new projects during the quarter. Overall, we have 64 active projects across 34 companies, we have 18 proposals outstanding with 18 companies as of March 1. We also continue to expand and improve our team. We recruited a Director, Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology to focus on traditional pharmacology consulting support, and we hired a senior clinical pharmacologist to increase capacity to support early- stage clinical development, advice and services."
28,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,28,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We ended the quarter with 52 full-time employees at our Buffalo division, up 1 from 51 in the prior quarter and up 10 from 42 last year. Our DILIsym or RTP division, revenue increased 45% for the quarter. Breaking this down, 48% of total division revenue was from DILIsym software and projects, 12% from RENAsym, 10% from IPF system -- excuse me, software, 12% from NAFLDsym software and projects, 6% from RENAsym grant and 12% from our heart failure project."
29,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,29,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"DILIsym has 20 active consulting projects and 7 active consortium of contracts at this time. We ended the quarter with 18 full-time employees at our RTP division, up 1 from 17 in the prior quarter and up 1 from 17 last year. I'll take a breath, and let me now turn the call over to John to review more detailed financial results. John?"
30,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,30,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks a lot, Shawn. Looking at the quarter here. First, our consolidated net revenues for the second quarter of our fiscal year '20, were up 22% or $1.9 million to $10.3 million compared to $8.5 million in the prior year. Total gross profit increased 23% to $7.7 million, representing a 74.2% gross margin in the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to a 73.9% margin in the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses were $4.1 million or 40% of revenue in the second quarter of this year, an increase of approximately $1.3 million or 46% compared to $2.8 million or 33% of revenue in the second quarter of '19."
31,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,31,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of increases in salaries, wages, labor and stock compensation costs, as the company has grown in headcount to support our revenue growth. We have also seen increases in selling expenses, commissions and advertising, some contract labor also. In addition, this quarter, we incurred about $300,000 of M&A-related due diligence costs associated with the Lixoft acquisition. Without these transactions-related cost, the SG&A would have been approximately 37% of revenue."
32,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,32,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"SG&A expense in the third quarter will be -- also be impacted by transaction costs associated with the Lixoft acquisition. Research and development costs for the most recent fiscal quarter were approximately $1.4 million. Of this total, $748,000 was expensed and $620,000 was capitalized."
33,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,33,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Income from operations for the second quarter of the year was $2.8 million, up approximately $96,000 or 3.5% compared to $2.7 million in the year ago quarter. Our provision for income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal year '20 was about $686,000, an effective rate of 24.2% compared to an effective rate of 22.1% in the prior year. We expect our tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range for this fiscal year."
34,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,34,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Net income increased by approximately 2.4% or $51,000 to $2.2 million in the most recent quarter compared to $2.1 million a year ago. On a per share basis, net income was $0.12 per diluted share in the second quarter of both this fiscal year and last fiscal year. The transaction expenses lowered EPS by just over $0.01 per share."
35,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,35,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"EBITDA was $3.5 million this quarter, up slightly compared to $3.4 million in the year ago quarter."
36,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,36,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Now going on to the year-to-date numbers. Consolidated net revenues year-to-date were up 23.4% or $3.7 million to $19.8 million compared to $16 million in the year ago. Our gross margin for the first 6 months was 73.1% compared to 72.5%. SG&A expenses, including the $300,000 of transaction-related costs were $7.6 million or 38.6% of revenue compared to 34.5% for the same period last year. Expense, effectively unchanged from the prior period -- or the prior year, excuse me. Income from operations for the period was $5.5 million compared to $4.8 million, and net income increased by approximately $600,000 or about 16% to $4.2 million compared to $3.6 million. EBITDA was $6.8 million year-to-date, up 10.5% compared to $6.2 million the prior year."
37,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,37,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to the next slide. This slide shows our revenue on a quarterly basis from fiscal year 2016 to the second quarter of 2020, illustrating both historical quarterly growth patterns and the seasonality of the business. Seasonality can best be seen using the 2019 purple bars. Our third quarter is typically our strongest quarter with a decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter that coincides with the slowdown in our clients' purchasing in the summer months. Our first and second quarters this year followed the same upward trend."
38,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,38,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"The next slide represents income by quarter, which illustrates a consistent track record of increases both year-over-year and sequentially through the first and third quarters with the fourth quarter, as we talked, a little bit lighter for the year. As you can see, the patterns for quarterly revenues and quarterly income from operations have largely held true for quite a number of years. This Slide 15, we can see that similar pattern of net income with the third quarter typically being the strongest. We isolated the impact of a $1.5 million deferred tax benefit in the second quarter of fiscal year '18 since it tends to skew the presentation without highlighting that difference."
39,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,39,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"On the next slide, diluted earnings per share follows the same pattern and tracks with net income as expected. As I mentioned earlier, fiscal year '20 second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.12, excluding the $300,000 of transaction costs related to Lixoft, as I indicated before, earnings would have been a $0.01 more."
40,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,40,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to EBITDA. Again, we expected the seasonal patterns to hold true with the overall trends moving upward and typically seasonal -- with typical seasonality between the quarters. Just a note here regarding the trends in these slides. Shawn has covered what we currently see related to COVID-19, after what is effectively only 1 month into the pandemic’s effect. No one is able to fully predict the full impact. But based on our annual renewal model for software revenues, we'd expect the seasonal nature of these trends to continue. We will be continually monitoring for changes."
41,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,41,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"This slide shows our revenue by region. We are a global business with the majority of our revenues in the Western Hemisphere, approximately 68% of revenues were in the Americas. Asia and Europe each represents 16% of the total revenue for our current year."
42,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,42,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to our cash position slide. This slide shows the strength of our cash position with a quarterly view of our cash balance and how we have used funds for dividends and acquisitions over the period. Observing the red balance line, we can see that the low point of cash or at the time when the company has invested in new acquisitions. The company shows patterns of cash accumulation post major acquisition dates. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year '17, on the far left, the blue bar at the bottom illustrate our consistent dividend payout. Approximately $900,000 per fiscal year through that -- through fiscal '17. At the beginning of 2018, the Board increased the dividend payment to $0.06 a share, thereby returning approximately $1 million to $1.1 million in cash to our shareholders quarterly through the present quarter. Today, on our press release, we announced that the Board has again continued the $0.06 quarterly dividend, and the next dividend payment will be May 1."
43,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,43,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Continuing with the chart, the green bars represent cash used for acquisitions. Cash flows from operations have allowed us to invest for future growth through acquisitions with the extra cash while keeping and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. Our reinvestment through acquisitions has exceeded $15 million over the last 4 to 5 fiscal years, while also returning more than $15 million to our shareholders through this consistent dividend payments without taking on any borrower debt. Subsequent to the quarter, as Shawn mentioned earlier, we established a line of credit in the amount of $3.5 million. Under terms of this agreement, at our discretion, we either pay interest at the prime rate or a fixed rate based on LIBOR plus 1.75% on funds drawn. It's a 2-year term with the agreement and there are no charges on funds for underused line fees. The agreement requires the company to satisfy certain financial covenants relative to profitability, EBITDA and annually requires the company to maintain a 0 balance for a 30-day period. While credit provides us cash management capabilities into the future."
44,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,44,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to the next slide. At the end of the year, again, we talked -- in the quarter, our cash was $12.2 million, which was up 7% compared to our fiscal year. Our balance sheet is clearly stronger today than a year ago as a direct result of our increased earnings power, cash flow generation and prudent allocation of capital."
45,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,45,John R. Kneisel,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Shawn, I'll turn the call back to you now."
46,"Simulations Plus, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,46,Shawn M. O'Connor,Chief Executive Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, John. We're all navigating a new world, impacted by this unprecedented pandemic. Thus far, we fared better than most and are well positioned to continue our long track record of success even in these challenging times. I'm excited to add Lixoft to our already strong and diverse organization, helping grow our European presence and improving our revenue mix. Demand for our solutions remain strong, although we will likely see some measure of delay in new business as our customers deal with the ramifications and uncertainties this pandemic has caused. And with that, I'd like to turn it over and take any questions you might have."
