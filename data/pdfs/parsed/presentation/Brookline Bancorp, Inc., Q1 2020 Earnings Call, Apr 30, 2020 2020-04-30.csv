The quote, ""may you live in interesting times"", which some consider a blessing and some curse, often arises in times of crisis. And those of us who will have lived during some very interesting times know there's a beginning, a middle and an end. We certainly empathize with those who are suffering physically, emotionally or financially at this time. But we also challenge every day."
7,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"At our last earnings call on January 30, while the coronavirus pandemic was on all of our radar screens, we were not considering a near complete shutdown of the worldwide economy, unemployment claims surging into the millions on a weekly basis, interest rates going sharply to near 0 again and the need for trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary economic assistance."
8,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On February 1, Massachusetts confirmed its first case of coronavirus, a University of Massachusetts student who had just returned from Wuhan. Massachusetts was the second state in the nation to report a case. On March 1, Rhode Island confirmed its first 2 cases, which were related to a returning school trip to Italy in February. On March 9, Rhode Island Governor, Gina Raimondo, declared a state of emergency, and that was followed by Massachusetts Governor, Charlie Baker, on March 10."
9,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As of today, both Massachusetts and Rhode island are operating in a stay-at-home environment, with only designated essential employees permitted to report to work. All nonessential retail businesses remain closed, and those that are allowed to open are doing so with restrictions in place."
10,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I will touch on just a few areas and initiatives related to our preparation and response to this pandemic, and you can see that on Page 4 in the presentation. The most important thing is the health and safety of our employees and their families. We were able to shift to a work-from-home policy very early on due to our strong VPN and Zoom capabilities, which we were fortunate to have in place well in advance of the current environment. We remain as flexible as possible to accommodate those who have children at home or caring for a family member who may be ill."
11,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"At present, approximately 81% of the company's non-retail employees are working remotely and effectively. While traffic in the streets is quite low, you wouldn't know it from looking at the drive-up at the branches. We initiated a bank by appointment approach with minimal lobby access to further promote social distancing for both the bankers and the customers. We also staggered staffing schedules to minimize employee exposure while ensuring business continuity. All types of hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes were distributed throughout the organization and enhanced cleaning went into place full time."
12,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"All customer-facing employees and those who are required to travel to company office have been provided with masks to minimize health risks to both employees and customers. We have had no furloughs and have actually been hiring for key positions, particularly in our call center and operations. Our bankers have never been busier in assisting new and existing businesses and retail customers with online banking and cash management services while also working to address any near-term cash flow concerns."
13,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"While much has changed over the last couple of months for the institution, much has remained the same. For our customers, we continue to reach out to ensure they know we are here for them. A company's culture is in the mission or a value statement. A company's culture is the sum of its actions and attitudes on a day in and day out basis of those who make up the organization in good times and bad. I am very proud of our company's culture, which is one of empathy for customers and colleagues in everything we do and what we also call our core 4 of accountability, teamwork, adaptability and leadership. They have truly been on display."
14,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I will now turn you over to Carl, who will review the company's first quarter results."
15,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Paul. Our company entered this year and this crisis in a position of strength, record 2019 earnings, strong growth in commercial and consumer banking and a fortress balance sheet, defined by excellent asset quality, strong reserves and a robust capital base. In many ways, we are headed for a promising start to 2020, solid loan originations, supported by good deposit growth and fee income. We also successfully completed the merger and consolidation of First Ipswich Bank into Brookline Bank in mid-February. Soon after the weekend of our data conversion, our preparation and response to the global pandemic became our highest priority."
16,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 6, we've provided summary income statements for the quarter, prior quarter and prior year. We recognized a net loss of $17.3 million for the quarter, which was driven by a provision for credit losses of $54.1 million. The significant increase in the provision was due to the potential deep and rapid decline in economic activity as our communities practice social distancing, schools and many businesses closed and nearly all events and activities were canceled. Also significant is our decision to continue forward and implement the new accounting standard commonly known as CECL, which shifted from estimating probable losses to estimating losses over the life of the loan using models based on future economic forecasts."
17,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Our pretax pre-provision net revenue decreased $2.6 million from a very strong performance in Q4 and as net interest income declined and operating expenses increased, driven by higher professional fees, FDIC insurance and seasonality associated with compensation and benefits."
18,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As illustrated on Page 7, net interest income declined $2.2 million as our net interest margin compressed 12 basis points. The yield on the loan portfolio declined 28 basis points as the pricing of over $1.8 billion in adjustable rate loans was significantly impacted by the sharp decline in prime and LIBOR rates. Linked- quarter declines in prepayment fees of $1.3 million and $153,000 in purchase accounting as well as an increase of $337,000 in amortization of deferred fees contributed 10 basis points in the decline in loan yields for the quarter. Overall, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 13 basis points, which consisted of an 11 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and a 20 basis point decline in the cost of borrowings."
19,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"If you could follow me to Slide 8, you can reference our comparative but summary balance sheets. In the first quarter, we had solid loan growth of $85 million or 5% on an annualized basis, and deposits grew $60 million or 4% annualized. Also notable is the $52 million growth in the allowance for loan losses and related $16 million growth in the reserves for unfunded loans. We also added significantly to our cash and securities to prudently position ourselves to meet the potential financial needs of our clients. The loss in the quarter, as well as the modest stock repurchase activities, reduced our tangible book value per share by $0.31."
20,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 9 reflects the growth and composition of our significant loan and deposit categories. In the first quarter, we continued to have strong net loan growth in commercial real estate, while net deposit growth was driven by noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings. Commercial real estate, which includes both investor and owner-occupied commercial real estate, makes up 55% of our loan portfolio. DDA represents 20% of our deposit base."
21,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"If you follow me to Slide 10, we have illustrated the near-term impact of the implementation of CECL in estimating the allowance for credit losses. At year-end, our total reserves for credit losses was $62.9 million, representing a reserve coverage of 78 basis points of total funded and unfunded loan commitments. There are 2 components: the allowance for loan losses, which was $61.1 million or 90 basis points of reserve coverage on loans outstanding; and a reserve of $1.9 million for unfunded credits. Accounting renewals were based on incurred or probable losses in the portfolio formulated on historical performance."
22,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The new accounting standard, which was implemented on January 1, requires estimates for losses to be forward-looking over the life of the loan based on economic forecast. We chose to use Moody's ImpairmentStudio as well as Moody's economic forecasts to develop our estimates. We also chose to prudently calibrate the loan loss models to the performance of a peer group of Northeast banks since our historical loss data was considered too infrequent and too low. At year-end, we used the economic forecast as of December 14, 2019 and determined the total reserve for credit losses, also known as the allowance for credit losses or ACL, to be $78.5 million or 97 basis points of total funded and unfunded loans. This was an increase of $15.6 million or 25% from the prior accounting methodology."
23,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"At March 31, we decided to wait for the most updated Moody's economic forecast as of April 4, instead of using the mid-March version, which was less severe. The calculated ACL was $130.4 million, an increase of $51.9 million from our day 1 estimate. This increased our coverage on total commitments from 97 basis points to 161 basis points."
24,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 11, we provide details on our reserve coverage on funded and total commitments by key segments and selected subset of our portfolio. The construction component of our commercial real estate portfolio experienced the highest change in coverage, rising from 148 to 513 basis points at March 31, requiring an additional allowance of $14.7 million in the quarter. We've also provided some of the key economic variables from the forecast driving our loss estimation models. It illustrates the significant expected deterioration from December to April in the economic forecast. Unemployment for the full year was expected to be 3.6% in the December 2019 forecast as compared to 6.3% in the April forecast, which had unemployment peaking at 8.7% in the second quarter before coming down to 6.5% at the end of the year. The commercial real estate price index also showed a significant 14.3% deterioration between the 2020 forecast."
25,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 12, we have provided industry breakdowns for our major loan segments. Note, we have included owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial loans and also reflect $64 million of commercial real estate loans within our equipment finance business. Investment commercial real estate of $3.2 billion comprises 47% of our outstanding loans. Apartments represent our largest segment. You can provide -- comprise 29% of our investment CRE portfolio, followed by office at 20% and retail at 17%."
26,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Our commercial portfolio is $1.2 billion or 18% of our portfolio, and within commercial, food and lodging represents 15%, followed by manufacturing at 12%. Equipment finance at $1.1 billion represents 16% of our portfolio, which is led by a focus on laundry, tow truck and fitness equipment. Consumer loans of $1.2 billion is comprised of 1 point -- 1-4 family residential and home equity loans. Note, we have no direct exposure to airlines, auto lending, consumer credit cards, student loans or energy. We've also included some information in the appendix for the presentation -- of the presentation, providing various metrics and details about the portfolio, including loan to values and vintages, which illustrate the strong culture of credit underwriting, underlying our reputation for asset quality."
27,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,We've maintained the same portfolio segment on Slide 13 to provide insight into our loan payment deferment activity as well as illustrate our commitment to prudently respond to customer needs during this crisis. We have provided 90-day relief on loan payments on either principal or principal and interest. And these short-term modifications had no impact on our internal credit ratings related to these credits or accrual of interest or accounting for these assets at this time.
28,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In total, loans with outstanding balances of $1 billion were granted a loan payment modification for approximately 15% of the portfolio as of April 17. The largest impacted categories were in our equipment finance units. We also provided deferred payment information by some selected segments we are tracking. As I mentioned earlier, apartments are our largest component of our investment commercial real estate portfolio. It is an area we pay close attention to. We have seen little need or requests for deferment. Another category we provide here is health care, also with few requests for deferments, where as an example, dentist offices are basically closed and only doing emergency procedures at this time. We certainly expect that activity to accelerate as offices will need to catch up on cleanings and other procedures."
29,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As the stay-at-home restrictions are lifted, we also expect coffee and donuts to bounce back, folks to be focused on their health, laundries to be busier and, unfortunately, traffic accidents and breakdowns to resume. I want to highlight these are well-run businesses, and we're all in good standing before the economy basically shut down."
30,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We have also been very active facilitating access to the SBA payroll protection program for our clients before the first round of funding closed on April 16, which we show on Slide 14. The company-funded its first PPP loan on Friday, April 3. And as of Friday the 24th, the company has originated 2,183 loans with balances of over $518 million. Portions of these loans will be eligible for forgiveness over the next several weeks, and we will also be tracking and reporting on the activity next quarter. We are very proud of the tremendous teamwork, adaptability, commitment and pure do-whatever-it-takes attitude we saw at every level and in every department across the organization. When the program reopened on Monday, as you would expect, we were back at it. However, the volume will be significantly less since we were very successful in helping our customers during the first round."
31,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As shown on Slide 15, the company continues to be very well capitalized, exceeding all regulatory requirements as well as our own internal policies and operating targets. At March 31, we had capital buffer of 2.6% or $183 million over regulatory well-capitalized standards. During the first quarter, the Board expanded the previously announced stock buyback plan from $10 million to $20 million. The company announced on March 24 it was suspending any further purchases and, at that time, had completed the repurchase of 848,000 shares for $10.4 million."
32,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 16 provides a history of our regular dividend payout, which continued this quarter as the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, which will be paid on May 29 to stockholders of record on May 15. Our dividend remains constant for the remainder of the year. Full year per share dividends would be $0.46, a 4.5% increase over 2019 and currently approximates a 4.4% yield."
33,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"This concludes my formal comments, and I'll turn it back to Paul."
34,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Carl. Joining us for the question-and-answer session today is Robert Rose, our Chief Credit Officer; and Michael McCurdy, our Chief Risk Officer and General Counsel. Brookline is very fortunate to have the expertise and experience of these gentlemen, particularly during this time, and I'm happy to say they represent the commitment and leadership I see across the organization. And now we will take questions."
