7,A. O. Smith Corporation - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,7,Kevin J. Wheeler,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Slide 6, please. We have a strong track record of driving financial performance and significant growth. Over the last decade, sales have grown 8%, and EBITDA and adjusted EPS have grown 15% and 21%, respectively. 2019 results are shown on Slide 7. Sales of nearly $3 billion were 6% lower than in 2018. The decline in 2019 sales was primarily a result of lower China sales, which declined 19% in local currency, largely due to weaker end market demand, elevated channel inventory levels at the beginning of 2019 and a higher mix of mid-price point products. Adjusted earnings in 2019 of $370 million declined 18% from 2018. In 2019, adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 were 15% lower than in 2018. The decline in profits were primarily due to lower performance in China. As weakness in our end markets in China persisted, we implemented several cost reduction actions in 2019 in that region. Compared with 2018, total annualized savings as a result of these actions is estimated to be approximately $45 million in 2020, of which approximately $30 million was realized in 2019."
8,A. O. Smith Corporation - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,8,Kevin J. Wheeler,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'm pleased to review several items regarding our 2019 performance on Slide 8. Sales in our North America segment increased 2%, and operating margin performance in North America grew over 50 basis points compared with 2018. Our North America water heater operations continued to perform well. I'm particularly pleased with our performance despite a 1% decline in residential industry volumes. Productivity within North America water treatment manufacturing and the effectiveness of our direct-to- consumer channel continued to improve. We expanded our North America water treatment platform with the acquisition of Water-Right, and the performance is right on track to our expectations. We announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend rate in early October to $0.24 per share, which represents a 5- year CAGR of 24%. And in China, the fourth quarter came in where we expected, with channel inventory climbing by more than a month. Channel inventory ended 2019 within the normal range of 2 to 3 months of sales."
