The initial results are just great. During the last 9 months of fiscal 2020, we won more projects than SeaChange won over the past 7 years.

Growing demand for video increases the provider expenses. For example, many TV providers are paying more for CDN, others are increasing network support and making immediate network investments to enable servicing the growing demand. In addition, while the TV providers' operating expenses is increasing, advertising revenues and video ARPU are going down. The increasing operating expenses with declining revenues, as we enter a recession, is a perfect storm for the TV providers. Our Framework is the best tool in the industry to address these challenges."
14,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,14,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the cost side, using our value-based engagement, we'll reduce our customers' operating expenses to a point where the total cost of ownership to use the Framework is almost 0. We try to make it impossible for the customer to say no, while protecting our target margins. In many cases, our customers reduced the video delivery operating expenses by 50%."
15,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,15,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the revenue side, the Framework enables the TV providers to offer web-like advertising for both live and on-demand TV, which enable them to protect and increase some of their advertising revenues.

We believe that within very few months, fiscal 2021 will be a great year for SeaChange."
16,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,16,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Before I discuss our outlook and strategic initiatives for fiscal 2021, I'll turn the call over to our CCO, Chad, to provide details on the Framework wins.

It's great to speak with you again today. We finished the fiscal year with an exceptionally strong win rate by securing 11 significant Framework deals in Q4, which was up approximately 30% over the prior quarter. The 11 Framework wins in the quarter brought the mentioned, we achieved this all in less than a year, a truly impressive feat on its own."
18,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,18,Chad A. Hassler,Chief Commercial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The 26 wins we secured reflects the increasing demand we are seeing across the industry for our versatile, cloud-based or localized video delivery solution. Framework enables content owners, service providers and broadcasters to offer a Netflix-like service for both live channels and video-on-demand, using existing cable networks and/or over-the-top. This helps these organizations stay competitive and generate new revenue streams by offering unique services and content to meet all their customers' viewing needs."

20,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,20,Chad A. Hassler,Chief Commercial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"From the top telecommunication companies in the U.S. to leading regional service providers globally, the common denominator is that these organizations are selecting the Framework to enhance the user experience, significantly reduce operating costs and more effectively monetize their installed base. An integral part of our success is thanks to the go-to-market strategy we implemented last April. If you had the opportunity to hear Yossi or I talk about the strategy in any detail, you'll know that it was inspired by simplicity. We started by introducing the Framework where we had truly the best components. This includes the best user interface and the best back office, and instead of being sold as stand-alone components, which is how the company previously sold, we began selling it as a fully integrated solution."
21,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,21,Chad A. Hassler,Chief Commercial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Customers were looking for a plug-and-play solution that just worked, not multiple components that they had to assemble to build a solution. While we've had great success selling Framework following this proven strategy, we're not resting on our laurels and are actively pursuing additional approaches and channels to drive greater adoption and revenue streams for SeaChange. Later this year, we plan to introduce the Framework plug-in store, which will be designed to help our customers do more with the Framework through both free and premium plug-ins, providing them with further avenues to monetize their installed base."
22,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,22,Chad A. Hassler,Chief Commercial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, the Framework technology enables us to change the way TV ads are sold, which, in turn, will allow our customers to recoup some of the ad revenue the TV industry has lost to the web over the past decade. In fact, we have several ongoing customer engagements and should be able to announce the initial customer deployments in the coming months."
23,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,23,Chad A. Hassler,Chief Commercial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Overall, we're really encouraged by the sales traction we achieved in fiscal 2020. We've entered the new year with a growing list of Framework customers, building recurring revenues through multiyear agreements, industry-leading technology, along with a robust pipeline of new opportunities that is well distributed across our geographic regions. We're confident these factors have positioned us well for continued success in fiscal 2021 and beyond."
24,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,24,Chad A. Hassler,Chief Commercial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to walk us through our financial performance for fiscal Q4 and the full year of 2020. Mike?"

We believe that we have the right cost structure to endure the next few months and later to prevail using our value- based engagement and unique value proposition. There is one final item I'd like to mention. Recently, we had a new module to the Framework, which will change the way the TV industry unsold and underutilized advertising inventory is monetized. We are currently working with several customers and will share more in the near future. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A. Operator?"
