First, please put your mobile phone on silent and do not make any video or audio recordings or take photographs. As you can see and as read in our announcements, ABN AMRO, to curtail and avert potential health risks, has made the unusual request to shareholders and depositary receipt holders not to attend the meeting in person. Instead, the bank has urgently requested that people use the option to cast their vote by electronic or written proxies or through virtual participation.

7,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,7,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"I will now briefly elaborate on the procedure during the meeting. You saw the agenda in the convocation. This is detailed behind me. You see the agenda again on your screen. Some agenda items comprise multiple items such as Agenda item 2 that comprises 2(a) through 2(g). And we will cover as many as possible sections and presentations pertaining to an individual agenda item consecutively. After the presentations, we will answer questions relating to those presentations. Agenda Item 2 that will be the case following the presentation by our auditor, EY. Considering the internal cohesion, you will then have a proper and complete overview. Since agenda Item 2(e) will be presented to you for an advisory vote. After this Agenda Item has been described, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. And answering the questions -- we will start by answering the questions received in advance.

I request participants from the room who has a question to rise if he wants to ask a question so that I can see. We are pleased to enable all virtual participants to ask questions while keeping track of time. To give everybody the opportunity, we suggest asking a maximum of 3 questions per agenda item. In addition, as we have announced, virtual participants may ask questions only if they have also submitted questions in writing prior to the meeting.

9,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,9,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"I assume that's all up and running and that everything is working.

If you do not make a selection or press multiple buttons at once that counts as abstention. And the voting will remain open for those in the room until the end of item 10. The voting results will be disclosed at the end of the meeting. In addition, as you've read previously, at the recommendation of the ECB, the ABN has rescinded the dividend proposal, which is agenda Item 3(b). I'll tell you more about that during the meeting. And given the exceptional circumstances, ABN AMRO had to cancel all social gatherings relating to the AGM. So unfortunately, there will be no reception after the meeting."
10,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,10,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"And I now close this Agenda Item. That takes us to the Agenda Item 2(a), which is discussing the report by the Executive Board. I'm pleased to give the floor to Kees van Dijkhuizen to present the report by the Executive Board."
11,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,11,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"[Interpreted] Thank you very much, Tom. On behalf of the Executive Committee, I must give you an introduction to our activities over the past year. 2019 was a year in which we focused on carrying out the gives us a head start in this mode of providing services. And of course, that's extremely appropriate in the current situation. ."
12,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,12,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As regards to commercial banking customers, we are in line with our strategy and are working hard on broadening our range of services by working together with partners such as accountancy software and cybersecurity."
13,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,13,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, we're looking at a future-proof bank where our staff can work together, effectively achieve excellent successes and really think in terms of improving the customer experience, as I say, those are 3 pillars of our strategy. It took 10 months, most efficient, to allow 95% of employees to work from home, we achieved that in 10 days in the light of COVID-19. We've also worked very hard on improving our processes and our IT infrastructure. Also we're looking at narrowing the range of products that we offer. In the last 3 years, I was working together with the whole Executive Committee in order to look at the strategy and achieving our objectives, talking about the importance of sustainability for the bank earlier. And it's not just a business opportunity. It's also the right thing to do in social terms and for the generations to come."
14,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,14,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In the past 3 years, we sped up the computerization agenda of the bank. We set up successful platforms like Tikkie and Grip. We've already got 10 million people using Tikkie. And in the recent years, we shifted from international private bank to offshore private bank for Northwestern Europe. This gives us a scope for further growth."
15,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,15,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Now I was talking about the cost cuttings we've achieved. And performance has gone up by 10% or more. This is the highest yield of the large Dutch banks, and therefore, puts us at the top of the European banks. We got a very strong capital position and because we started amply in time to prepare for Basel IV, we're also looking at real challenges, though. Firstly, we had to take -- we're the first large bank in the Netherlands to announce that more than EUR 2.5 million balance would result in negative interest being paid. We also were amongst -- we were the first big bank in Netherlands to assure smaller savers below EUR 100,000 would not get charged negative interest rates. We've worked out a very comprehensive plan in order to act as gatekeepers for the financial system. We want to put flesh on the bones of those 5 words. The same applies to our work with the Dutch public prosecution authorities. We cooperate with them as fully as possible."
16,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,16,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Regarding institutional banking, we also want to look at improving yield by restricting the capital impacts in a number of sectors and activities. And of course, that work is remaining to be finished. ABN AMRO is a solid and resilient bank, able to cope with difficulty in the future. Now in the last year, the Dutch economy did very well, partly thanks to comparatively low public debt, which put the Dutch state in a good position to brace itself and cope with the shock of the COVID-19 crisis. But the consequences of the crisis will nevertheless be very extensive. In addition to COVID-19, we're expecting pressure on the markets to continue to increase in the light of sustained low interest rates. Our clients are facing a very hard time."
17,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,17,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And I'm pleased to say, we've got more than 50,000 SMEs in the Netherlands being given loans of EUR 50 million and automatic delay in payments. We're also offering suspension of repayments to mortgage customers and personal loan holders where necessary. So this has become the new normal. And I'm delighted to say that we've got good IT systems in place, so that we can have 18,000 people working at home, tele-working, the new normal."
18,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,18,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Now of course, workers in the bank have been having to work very hard on making the new system work and providing support to difficulties in businesses and difficulties and also to friends and relatives. I'm delighted to report the way in which all of our staff have really put their shoulders to the wheel in order to make sure we can have the best service possible available from the bank. I'm delighted to say that banks are part of the solution this time rather than part of that problem. And it's really good to see how governments, supervisory authorities and banks have all joined hands. We're working closely together, for example, with the Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs, State Secretary for Economic Affairs at the Deutsche Bank, but also we're looking at a national level with international -- with the European Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
19,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,19,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Now the COVID-19 crisis had an impact. This impact on the economy is going to be huge for our clients and also for our loan book. We've issued a profit warning in the light of this. Some sectors are going to be really hit very hard, which means that our credit facilities are going to increase significantly. Of course, we're not happy to see that happening. But we have got sound capital buffers, and we are able to handle it. Robert Swaak, who will take on from me, was closely involved in all of this work over the past week. Now EUR 2 billion profit, 10% yield, we can see really good solid results in 2019. It's a good success, particularly in light of the very low interest rates. We are, as I say, one of the most resilient banks in the Netherlands and Europe. Our costs are under control, our cost-cutting programs are working out well."
20,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,20,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Looking at dealing with financial crime activities. We continued to work hard on this in the past, and we expect that we can continue downward pressure on financial crime in coming years. In the fourth quarter, we did have to have unusually large reserves particularly because of bad loans in the offshore sector. Now corporate and institutional banking in the past 18 months did deconstruct EUR 5 billion in assets. It was not possible for the commercial banking yield to go as we wish to achieve it. We're looking to see what more we can do to get closer to our target there."
21,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,21,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"What about the financial crime issue in combination with the negative interest income that had on income. The income ratio in 2020 will, therefore, not be able to meet its target. Other financial targets are the return on equity and the dividend targets -- all of the other targets have actually been achieved."
22,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,22,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As regards to our capital position. Well, it's very high up and it's improved significantly since the share issue in 2015. We are looking EUR 2.06. Now I have a final dividend, which would be EUR 1.28, which is 62% of profit. This is in keeping with our dividend policy, where by 50% of profits are paid out as dividend and additional dividends are paid out if our capital position allows it. Now because of the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, the European Central Bank has called upon European banks to postpone payments of proposed dividends, at least until the first of October. We have decided to accede to that request. The final dividend is, therefore, held in reserve until the fall out of the 2019 crisis can become clear. Until the decision is made about that, therefore, it will not be added to the capital."
23,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,23,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As regards to our nonfinancial targets as well, we made really good progress in 2019. Diversity remains important. The number of women at the top level or top 600 has held steady at 28%. In our top 60, internal in-house potential for future performances are now coming up towards 40%."
24,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,24,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Our efforts on the sustainability front have once again been rewarded by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again is a good score. And employee satisfaction is also holding steady at the target level of 80%. In private banking as well, customer satisfaction remains satisfactory, although lower for some of the others, commercial and institutional. We are hoping to further improve our Net Promoter Score in coming years. That brings me to the end of what is in 2019, ABN AMRO has financially solid results. And on the nonfinancial report -- front as well, we made some real progress. In the recent years, we've focused particularly on tightening up our strategy and implementing it to have our 3 pillars; sustainability; customer experience; and future-proof banking."
25,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,25,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In the last year, the bank has achieved 10% yield or more, and the bank has a sound capital buffer, partly thanks to the Executive Committee's excellent work in recent years. Despite facing hostile weather such as the low interest rates, ABM AMRO remains a resilient bank, and we can cope with a blow or 2 in the future. I'll be happy to hand over to my successor, Robert Swaak. I'd be very proud that I have the privilege of working to improving this bank in the future, better banking for our customers, better banking for future generations."
26,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,26,Kees C. van Dijkhuizen,Former Chairman of Executive Board & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, I'd like to express my particular thanks to all of our staff, my fellow members of the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board, for all the enjoyment I've had working with them in recent years. I wish my successor, Robert Swaak, all the very best in steering the bank into its next phase."
27,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,27,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"[Interpreted]. Thank you, Kees. Also for these lovely words, I'll be getting back to them later on, as I'm sure you understand. On to agenda Item 2(b), which is the report by the Supervisory Board. This report appears in the 2019 Annual Report, and I'm just going to elaborate on it briefly. One important section in 2019 was planning for the succession of the Executive Committee, especially the succession of CEO, Kees van Dijkhuizen, and the recruitment and selection process of 3 new Supervisory Board members were another important topic for the Board. Of course, other topics figured high on the agenda. These included the legal merge between ABN AMRO Bank and ABN AMRO Group, the approach for detecting financial crime, the investigation by the public prosecution service, the 2020 to 2023 financial plan, and the split of the remuneration, selection and nominations committee. In addition, the Supervisory Board was involved in and liaised with the Executive Board and Executive Committee to implement the refined 2018 strategy and the new purpose of the bank, Banking for better generation -- Banking for better, for generations to come. Other important topics in 2019 included improving the cost-to-income ratio, simplifying internal processes and controls, optimizing return on equity at the bank, updating the capital plan based on Basel IV, improving the general quality of data, innovation and cybersecurity. The 3 committees on the Board, the Audit Committee, the Risk and Capital Committee and the Remuneration, Selection and Appointments Committee also discussed a wide variety of topics in part to prepare the meetings and decision-making by the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee addressed financial results, bank-wide risk reporting and the funding and capital plans, those are important topics for the Risk and Capital committee as was the progress on compliance-related topics. Of course, the Remuneration, Selection and Appointments Committee dealt with the search for a new CEO succession procedures and development of talent and leadership. The new CLA that took effect on January 1, 2020, and the remuneration policy for the Executive and Supervisory Boards. And this concludes Item 2(b), the discussion of the Supervisory Board report, and I will now move on to Item 2(c), which is the presentation by the Employee Council. And I'm pleased to give Rianne Kamphuis, Chairperson of the Employee Council, the floor. Rianne, you have the floor."
28,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,28,Rianne Kamphuis,Chairman of Employee Council,EXECUTIVES,"[Interpreted] Thank you, Tom. Can everybody hear me? Yes. To shareholders and depositary receipt holders, I'm Rianne Kamphuis, I chair the Employee Council, which is the ABN AMRO's Works Council. I'm pleased to give you the view of the employees of the firm. And that's quite challenging because, in fact, what I say here and everything that relates to banking is under scrutiny. And what I say on behalf of the employees is therefore under scrutiny as well. Is that a reason to refrain from addressing you today? Now more than ever, we aim to do this. Employee participation at ABN AMRO has chosen not to apply the speaking right to various individual items, but to use it on a different more precarious topic. This week, I happen perhaps coincidentally to encounter the topic fault lines that literally relates to a gap that can separate persons or groups. For example, because of a difference of opinion or an event. And each time, the topic that brought about that gap is touched in some way the fault line deepens and the gap widens. The gap between the persons and groups on each side of the fault line keeps expanding. I see such a fault line in the daily operations of our employees during the financial crisis, a fault line emerged between banking and society. ABN AMRO is well aware that in the past, within our sector, some incorrect decisions were taken. Despite doing our utmost to correct those errors, the gap with respect to society remains after 12 years. It has not yet been bridged."
29,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,29,Rianne Kamphuis,Chairman of Employee Council,EXECUTIVES,"Looking back on the previous year, I see the pressure on employees to safeguard our license to operate and practice to apply the progressively stringent regulations without causing our customers to become victims. And I also see how increasingly employees have to defend themselves against criticism from the media and from society. This time more than ever is making clear that we need to bridge that gap between us and society because at present an entirely different crisis figures in society, that's crisis of public health with potentially nefarious consequence for our customers and for the economy in general. We will all need each other. So I hope that we'll learn to seek each other out once again, so that we will trust the employees and the bank to be able to help customers constructively so that society once again acknowledges the added value of banks and recognizes that regulations are supportive, but that there are limits to what is feasible and what is not feasible. And in that way, we can take care of each other. That's my message for today."
30,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,30,Rianne Kamphuis,Chairman of Employee Council,EXECUTIVES,"And the second part to wrap up, but at least equally important is my thanks to Kees van Dijkhuizen. I can say with certainty that Kees has been one of the ambassadors within ABN AMRO in forming our purpose and certainly in conveying it. In his role as CEO, he's experienced turbulent times and has consistently given his all and his full commitment to our organization. Kees, thank you very much for your relentless dedication, including during this very challenging time. On behalf of all ABN AMRO coworkers, we wish you all the very best. And I'm going to give you a short round of applause. Thank you so much."
31,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,31,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"[Interpreted] Thank you very much, Rianne. I greatly appreciate your kind words. I suggest we move straight on to agenda Item 2(d), Corporate Governance. Now in the chapter of leadership and governance in the Annual Report, you've seen an extensive explanation of ABN AMRO's corporate governance structure. We have what is known as a 2-tier board, that is to say, an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. In addition, there's an Executive Committee, which supports the Executive Board in carrying out its vision, strategy and preparation for risk across the bank as a whole. The Executive Board is the statutory government of the bank. They are -- have the final responsibility for management and general activities in the bank. And as we said earlier, at the end of today's meeting, Kees will cease to be a member of the Executive Board and on that agenda item, we will come back to consider that situation. The Supervisory Board monitors, advises and supports the Executive Board, and the Executive Committee in their work. The Executive Committee is responsible for guiding ABN AMRO's business activities and those of its subordinates. The Executive Board brings the whole Executive Committee into implementing its -- deciding on the vision, strategy and risk policy across the whole of the bank. So the members of the Executive Committee, altogether makes a significant contribution to ABN AMRO's strategic directing with a long-term value creation target and of course, keeping the customer at the center of things."
32,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,32,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"Last year, as you may remember, the legal fusion of -- legal merger of ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO Bank was on the agenda of the meeting, and you decided in favor of the merger back then. This merger were then carried out on the 29th of June 2019, and as a result, ABN AMRO Group no longer exists. Against this background, the Articles of Association, Executive Board and the Supervisory Board have been adapted and those of ABN AMRO have also been amended. You will find the rules and the Articles of Association on the website. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board has decided that the remuneration commission and the selection and nomination commission should be separated out. From November 2019, onwards, ABN AMRO has a separate remuneration commission chaired by Arjen Dorland and a separate Selection and Nomination Committee, chaired by myself. In that framework as well, the bank's rules have been adapted. As I'm sure you've seen on the website."
33,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,33,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"At this moment, NLFI holds 49.9% of ABN AMRO's shares and STAK AAB, 50.1%. In addition, NLFI also holds 6.4% of depositary receipts. With depositary receipts, it has a 56.3% holding in ABN AMRO's."
34,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,34,Tom de Swaan,Independent Chairman of the Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, I will inform you that ABN AMRO provided a report in the Annual Report on its performance according to the Corporate Governance code in 2019. We meet all the requirements of the Corporate Governance code, apart from some provisions set out in the Corporate Governance codes and Regulations section, dealing with that in detail in a report. In addition, on our website, you can find an extensive 2(e), remuneration report of 2019. And here, I refer you to the remuneration report as set out in the 2019 Annual Report. And in particular, we have a meeting document. To deal with that, I give the floor to Arjen Dorland, who is chairing the Remuneration Committee. He will run us through the policy."
35,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,35,Arjen C. Dorland,Independent Vice Chairman of Supervisory Board,EXECUTIVES,"[Interpreted] Okay. ABN AMRO has a moderate remuneration policy that meets all the rules for publicly listed and financial institutions. This includes restrictions concerning variable remuneration. And there's a prohibition of bonuses for some employees and senior management. The foundation for the remuneration principles within the bank are set forth in ABN AMRO's global reward policy and aligned with implementing ABN AMRO's purpose, Banking for better, for generations to come and are applied bank- wide in compliance with local circumstance. The Supervisory Board approves the general remuneration principles and did so in the year under review. In 2019, employees in the Netherlands were subject to the ABN AMRO CLA 2018 to 2020. Now a new 2-year CLA has been signed that will be in effect until January 1, 2022. This new CLA reflected various adjustments in terms of employee contributions to the pension plan so that it will remain fit for the future. As for employees outside the Netherlands, in applying remuneration principles, local and relevant circumstances and job markets and regulations are considered as well. The Executive Board has been subject to a separate remuneration policy since 2010. This continues to be based on the policy as adopted by the Executive Board of ABN AMRO at this time. Since then, there have been some adjustments in compliance with more rigid regulations such as the prohibition on bonuses since 2011 and the Wbfo that has applied since 2015. In 2019, the contractual relationship with the Executive Board was amended as a consequence of the legal merge because the 4 executive Board members are managers according to the Articles of Association. They could no longer work based on an employment agreement. As of June 29, 2019, the employment agreement was therefore transitioned into what's known as a services agreement. This conversion has not affected the applicable working conditions and remuneration. The Supervisory Board is responsible for awarding the remuneration of the Executive Board within the limits of the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting. The principle is a total remuneration package slightly below the median of the relevant market. As long as the Dutch state holds shares in ABN AMRO, no variable remuneration can be awarded to members of the Executive Board, and there's also a prohibition for individual adjustments of the annual base salary. The base salary of members of the Executive Board may be adjusted only in keeping with collective salary adjustments according to this bank CLA. Since January 1, 2019, the salaries of the 4 Executive Board members have, therefore, been increased by 2.5%, pursuant to the salary increase in the bank's CLA for 2019 and 2020. The ratio of the average annual employee remuneration compared with the complete annual remuneration for the CEO remained the same in 2019 as the ratio in 2018, which was 9.6. This is calculated by dividing the remuneration of the CEO by the average employee remuneration. This includes pension costs, and this is based on the average number of employees in 2019. In 2016, the ratio was 11.4. In 2017, it was 10.0. The relatively low ratio aligns with the moderate remuneration policy that applies within ABN AMRO. For additional information about remuneration of Executive Board members, please see the remuneration report included in the 2019 Annual Report and Note 35 to the 2019 financial statements. The fixed salary for the 5 positions within the Executive Committee that are not members of the Executive Board is based on the Executive Board salary, taking into account the different responsibilities of these Executive Committee members. The salaries of the Executive Committee members reflect the collective wage progression of the ABN AMRO CLA, and in compliance with this been increased from January 1, 2019 by 2%. For additional information about the salary and remuneration of individual Executive Committee members, please see Note 37 of the 2019 financial statements. ."
36,ABN AMRO Bank N.V. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,36,Arjen C.
