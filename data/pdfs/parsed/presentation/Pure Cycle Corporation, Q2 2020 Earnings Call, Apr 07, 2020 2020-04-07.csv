0,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,0,Operator,,,"Greetings and welcome to the Pure Cycle Corporation 2020 Second Quarter and 6-Month Financial Conference. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your speaker, Mark Harding. Mr. Harding, you may begin."
1,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,1,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, and I'd like to welcome you all to our second quarter call. Some housekeeping measures. We do have a slide deck for this. So if you want to log in to our website, it should be on the front landing page. It'll just say second quarter presentation. If you don't see it there, then you can surf over to the Investors section, and there'll be a link there as well. So that'll allow you to follow along with the presentation and the prepared remarks."
2,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,2,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I'm going to beg forgiveness for those of you who are new to the company. Probably just jump into sort of the quarter end without giving kind of the overview -- typical overview of the company. We've got some excellent resources on our website if you're new to the company and want to get a little bit more color about sort of how we do things and how we got to where we are. There's a couple of podcasts on there that will give you that presentation.
3,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,3,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But with that, let me go ahead and start the call here. And the first thing I need to do is while I said I was going to go through the presentation quickly, I got to get through at least the second slide, which is to get the lawyers out of the room, saying that this is our safe harbor statement, and really, these are our forward-leading statements not intended to be policy or direction or guidance to our investors."
4,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,4,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So with that, I'm going to roll -- scroll you guys down to Slide 6 and really start by giving you all an update into our land development segment and give you kind of an update of the activity that we've had."
5,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,5,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As you all know, we've got a very large master plan community located in the I-70 corridor here in the Denver metropolitan area. We've embarked on our first phase of that, which includes a little over 500 lots. We have 3 national homebuilders that are under contract for all of our homes -- all our lots on that. We have Richmond America, Taylor Morrison and KB, and all 3 of them are very active in building homes out there."
6,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,6,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We have -- of the 506 lots, I think we've delivered about 380 of the 506 lots. So there's really just 2 more takedowns. I think Richmond has taken down all of their lots. Taylor Morrison has one more takedown requirement -- one more takedown of lots, which will be about 49 lots. And then I think KB has another 50 lots, and they're going to be, plus or minus, maybe a little bit more than 50 lots. I think they've got maybe 2 more takedown schedules."
7,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,7,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The really nice thing about our project here is all 3 of our builders have accelerated their takedowns from their original contract schedules, mostly due to, really, the success that this project has had. We've had a great entry into the market, mostly because of our price point. Our price point is an entry-level price point. Our homes start in sort of the kind of [ 3 40, 3 50 ] range. That's -- as sad as that may sound, that's the starter home in the Denver market. But we have a real mix of homeowners out there. We have had our first, sort of share -- our homeowner community meeting and got a chance to meet with a number of those folks. We have about 7 -- a little more than 70 people occupying houses out there. And the first community meeting was a huge success. I think we had more than 42 homes represented -- families from 42 homes represented. I will throw a shout out there to KB who gave us one of their model homes for the meeting place there, and they gave us some things to snack on there. So I give them a shout out and thank them for that. But the project is going great."
8,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,8,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In addition to the actual occupied homes, we probably got, I'd say, 120, 130 homes under construction. So I'd say we're right close to 200 homes either built or under construction. We've got -- I'm going to -- let me pull that back -- about 180 building permits issued. So you can't get started on a home until you've actually got a building permit."
9,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,9,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We have paid tap fees. So in addition to selling lots, as many of you know, we are a water utility, and we keep that track of that metric as well. We've got about 217 water and wastewater taps purchased from our homebuilders. And then how this is likely to roll out for the rest of this first phase, we'll deliver the remaining 127 lots through calendar year-end. So there's -- of those 3 or 4 more closings, those are staggered throughout the rest of the year. So you'll see announcements as we get those closed. I'll likely send out a press release for each of those announcements to let everybody know how those are progressing through."
10,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,10,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'll move to the next slide, Slide 7, that will kind of give you both a visual as well as a numerical representation of the progress since Q1. So you can see we are having a tremendous start, and then we're really just getting into the building season. So we've got a number of new homes. I'd say 70 residents as we were describing, and I think home builders are averaging about 6 homes per month per builder. So that absorption has been very exciting over the winter. We'll see how that continues to progress in this new environment that we're in. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the presentation."
11,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,11,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Move to Slide 8. Slide 8 will really kind of give you a view of the rest of the project. 1,000 -- that's about 935 acres in total. So this first 155 acres is really just the first entry into that. And as you can see, I want to highlight really the next residential component of that. The next phase incorporates 480 acres, and there's much more than just the residential component. We have a large commercial component, which is going to be up along the interstate. So we have about a half a mile of frontage along the interstate, and we have our own interchange that's existing right at the exit to the property. But we're going to focus in on kind of the next residential component of that, and we have a very broad product mix in our next residential component."
12,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,12,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If you flip to the next page, that will kind of give you kind of a land plan layout. And really, the mix is going to be more than -- we have kind of -- in our first phase, we just had 2 product mixes, a 45-foot and a 50-foot lot. Those are pretty homogeneous that did allow the builders to be able to take a wide variety of homes on those sites, but it was still a pretty typical stand-alone detach single-family house. In the next phase, we'll have a little bit more density on the per acre on that. We'll have some smaller lots, a 32-foot single family, 45s and 50s like the first phase. We'll have some paired product out there, which means we'll have some duplexes and then some townhome product where we'll have clusters. And so it relatively does speak to a much larger customer base, a much more diversified product offering amongst the number of builders that we're looking at."
13,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,13,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We'll likely phase this in -- so this will be our second phase, but we'll probably have 4 micro phases here. As you can kind of see, we've set that up where you can see each phase is somewhere in the 230 to 260 lot deliveries. And so it allows us to be able to manage our construction costs, so we don't get too far out developing those lots before we move on to the next increment."
14,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,14,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think we did a very good job of efficiently delivering the first 500 lots in our first phase. And so we don't want to stray too far away from that model because I think that was very good, not only for our builders so that they didn't have to inventory too much as well as the company, so we didn't have to inventory too much in terms of the development cost. So we can do a lot of those land, like the earthwork. Maybe we carve that up into 2 phases, but we can carve up the utilities and the roads, curves and gutters into 4 phases so that we're much more real time in delivering those. So that's I know important to our shareholders because they want to make sure that we're using our capital wisely. We're not putting too much into our work in progress, or WIP, on that without having our builders kind of there with us payment progresses."
15,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,15,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think our contracts are going to look very similar in the second phase as they looked in the first phase where we're going to get maybe 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 delivery schedule where we'll get paid a portion of the lot cost -- of finished lot costs as we plot the property and then a progress payment as we deliver wet utilities and then a final progress payment as we deliver the final lot -- final finished lot."
16,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,16,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Pricing is probably going to be a little bit stronger. I would like to be able to disclose that pricing to you. I think we know -- I have a pretty good idea about that. But until we get our contracts finalized with each of our builders, I'm going to keep that in our pocket, and we'll look forward to giving you that guidance as that becomes available to us."
17,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,17,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Let's move on to Page 10. So Page 10, as you know, we also supply water and wastewater services. And one of the biggest activities that we have in the water segment is supplying water to the oil and gas industry when the oil and gas industry existed. They seem to have taken a hiatus this year just mostly due to the price of oil. We did have some repositioning of the assets in the field. So our largest operator, ConocoPhillips, had sold their position in this field to a group called -- a private company called Crestone Peak Resources. You can Google them and find out a little bit more about them. But they're almost exclusively owned by Canadian pension funds. So they operate a little bit differently than maybe a public E&P company. They really do have a long-term focus. I've been very impressed with their management and their leadership. In point of the transition, how they've handled the transition, the communication channels that we have with them, about how they look to take a look at the field and then also what's going on in the current market, with oil in the mid-20s now, which is a significant improvement than it was maybe 6 or 7 days ago, but looking at oil in the low 20s, it certainly puts a lot of pressure on E&P companies' ability to really invest into a field right now. And so I think most of their activity is on hold for 2020 in terms of new exploration. One of the things that they did have as a carryover from ConocoPhillips is they have 13 wells that Conoco had drilled and completed on the drilling side, but they hadn't fracked those wells. So if you look at some of the low-hanging fruit and they look at this as to say based on -- we'll make a sort of a month-to-month assessment based on the price of oil as to how we want to pick up and the timing of completing those wells so that they can get those in production and really a very modest investment to bring on production or at least complete those wells and hold those leases by production. So there's a little bit of opportunity for us to have some activity on that, but I don't have a lot of guidance on that because they don't have a lot of guidance just yet."
18,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,18,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Moving to the next slide, Slide 11. Let me give you some of the financial metrics, our water assets. So our assets are going up -- continue to go up from year-end last year as well as do our cash and investments. So you always want to own companies that have increasing assets as well as increasing cash position. That usually means that they're making money. And this is one of those areas where we find ourselves in a very unique position where we're very strong and very highly appreciating asset base and a very strong and not making very much money, but a lot of liquidity within the company."
19,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,19,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'm sorry, let me take that -- that could be misinterpreted. We are making a lot of money. Our cash is not making a lot of money right now."
20,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,20,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Let me roll to the next slide, Slide 12. That gives you kind of the metrics on the P&L. Operating revenues, that's a 6-month number, $14 million over what was last year. So we're a little bit ahead of where we were this month -- this time last year. And then growth in income from continuing operations on the share basis, $0.25 a share. And then profitability, if you take a look at the net income after-tax, we are -- we have used up all our tax credits. So now I end up having to send some of those dollars to help support that $2 trillion benefit package that Washington has sent out. But we're now happy to be reporting a very good margin after-tax profit."
21,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,21,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Page 13 will give you kind of a breakdown on where that money is coming from. So if you look at the land development segment, a little over $10.8 million on lot sales. The tap fee revenue is about $2.8 million. So we're getting a good monetization of the equity value that we have in our water system. What has fallen off is obviously fracking water revenues. So very nominal revenue for this fiscal year in the fracking revenue. We really haven't had a single frac in this fiscal year. That revenue that you see there, that $57,000 is sort of incidental water that would be going to a pad site for any construction activity in the pad side water compaction or a number of things like that."
22,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,22,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And then we also have some oil and gas minerals. And what you see is kind of a substantial tick up in our oil and gas royalties, and that was because Conoco had drilled and completed another 4-well pad site on some of our land. And if you remember, we have 2 sections where we carry forward net mineral interest on that. This is in the smaller portion of that. We have 1/8th pooling in -- where these 4 wells are. And then in the other pooling interest, we have 3/8 of that. So this is even in the smaller well pooling. So it gives you kind of an impact on the fact that this is a very oil-rich field and -- but for the price of oil being in the 20s, would be being developed on a pretty aggressive basis. And so there will be cycles in that. This too will end in terms of the pricing war that we have currently in the oil sector, and we will continue to be able to monetize that in terms of our mineral estate as well as the opportunity to share our water assets and sell water for fracking revenue."
23,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,23,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Next slide, balance sheet impact. So that gives you a kind of a period-over-period balance sheet impact. And then on the Slide 15, sort of the P&L. One of the non-GAAP measures there that I think is good to keep track of is our sort of our EBITDA -- our non-GAAP EBITDA there. So you got $8.7 million for the 6 months ending. So when you look at sort of trending on how's the company doing with its assets, your investment into these assets over those many years has really started to really benefit our shareholders and really provide value to that."
24,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,24,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So with that, I do want to spend a little bit of time talking about sort of our unique -- the world that we're in sort of today and talk about some of our response to the virus impacts. Water and wastewater are essential services. So we're one of those exempt industries, and our employees are exempt. So our day-to-day operations are pretty much -- pretty normal. I would say, our field crews are pretty, I'd say, standard. We have the typical folks that are going to be in and out of a flu season. We are very particular about if somebody is sick. We want them to stay home. We give them -- the company -- as an employee- centric company, we have a very generous PTO policy. So we want to make sure that, one, they take care of their health, but then they also make sure that we take care of all of our coworkers' health as well. But that said, we do have to be on site. We do have to make sure that the water keeps flowing and wastewater keeps being processed."
25,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,25,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our office personnel, probably 80-20 mix, where we have 80% of the people still commuting to the office. We try to stick to our offices and maintain our distances from each other just to have best practices and make sure that we have continued healthy professionals here. But we do have some folks that have a type of job responsibility where they can commute from home, and they do a very efficient job and are very productive of being able to do that. Some of our engineers and accounting staff can do some of that stuff remotely."
26,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,26,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our builders continue to complete the houses that they have under contract. They have said that their walkthroughs, the on-site traffic is down substantially, and that's really primarily because Colorado, like I think most states in the U.S., are on sort of a stay-at-home period where other than essential activities, they're sort of discouraging that essential activities. That said, the construction industry itself is classified as essential. So while they may not have a lot of construction, they do have a lot of contracts and a lot of homes that are in the pipeline, and there's -- there continues to be a lot of activity on site. So those homes that had started construction or that they have contracts for, they continue to start new starts. They continue to complete those homes because they have specific delivery time lines on that, and we have to support that. So our field crews are out there setting meters, making sure that we have inspections on water and sewer lines and all that activity."
27,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,27,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"What else? I think I did mention the oil and gas activity. That has been deferred for 2020. But again, there are 13 wells that are sort of that low-hanging fruit, and we'll see how the -- our new partner looks to capitalize on being able to invest in those new activities and -- I'm sorry, those existing wells to frac those and bring those things on to market."
28,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,28,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If you take a look at our Phase 2. We are in conversation with as many as 7 different builders. We don't think we have room for all 7 builders, but we have -- we've sort of put it in front of 7 national homebuilders, and all 7 want to be in the project, and we're trying to balance out each individual builder with what their product specialties are. So some builders specialize on paired products. Some builders have townhome products. Some builders have alley load product and some builders don't. And so we want to figure out and really find a market segmentation for each of the builders to be able to get them to have some value proposition of doing what they do well, segment out the different types of players that we have on the site and really looking to finalize those agreements within the next 90 days. Our opportunity would be to be able to be under construction and be in the ground sometime late this year. I would say, I keep saying September, October, but because of where we're at with our current market conditions, I'm looking for maybe November, December time frame. So we'll see how this continues on. But still being in a position where we can deliver lots for -- that sometime in 2021 time frame, and then they can start constructing on some of their model homes and then be really opportunistic by selling some of what their product is. So some of the builders that we have in our first phase have a strong interest in being in our second phase as well as some new builders. So looking at how that traffic is going to go through the winter of '21 as well, so they can continue to build through the seasons on that."
29,"Pure Cycle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,29,Mark W. Harding,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So with that, what I'd like to do is turn it back over to the moderator, maybe open it up to some questions. I know you all probably have a lot of questions about how we're handling all of the activity and sort of what this current market conditions might impact on the company. So with that, I'll turn it back over."
