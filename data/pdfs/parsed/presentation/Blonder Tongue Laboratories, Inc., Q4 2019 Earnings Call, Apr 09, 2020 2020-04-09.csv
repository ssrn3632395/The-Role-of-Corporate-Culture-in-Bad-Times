So I caution you that actual results may differ from those that may be projected in our comments this morning.

6,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,6,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Blonder Tongue completed 2019 with net sales of $19,842,000, which was a decrease of 8.6% below the $21.7 million we reported for 2018. These reduced sales resulted in a net loss of $742,000 contrasted with a net loss of $1.339 million in 2018. These losses were a direct result of reduced sales volumes in DOCSIS-compliant modem and CMTS products as well as declines in a particular line of digital video and coding products and traditional HFC distribution technology. Those losses were partially compensated for by an increase in sales in our NXG digital video signal processing platform and our new CPE set-top box systems initiative."
7,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,7,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"These results are in no way acceptable to the company, its management or to our Board of Directors. The company has already taken a number of measures to improve our future performance and are planning and currently implementing additional changes, some of which we will touch on during the call today. Although the overall results in 2019 were not acceptable, the company did have a number of specific positive accomplishments and successes during the year that we are building on for 2020 and that we consider significant towards achieving our short- and mid-term goals."
8,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,8,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"But before we get into specific actions taken as a result of our 2019 performance, I would like to cover details of the company's status and what we've been dealing with regarding the current COVID-19 situation. Blonder Tongue falls into an essential business category due to our U.S.- based manufacturing, engineering design and sales of telecommunications equipment. That equipment goes out to a large number of telephone, cable and municipal fiber optic service operators around the country, both large and small. The company has been able to remain open for business through the crisis."
9,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,9,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Beginning in very early February, the company began implementing enhanced cleaning and disinfecting processes on a daily basis at our primary manufacturing and headquarters facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey. The team has been updating those cleaning and precautionary practices on a constant basis over the last 2 months, as additional information about the virus and its attributes have been better understood and reported."
10,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,10,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, in early March, we moved all roles capable of being performed as work-from-home to be done from home company-wide and adapted our operational processes accordingly. I'd like to thank our Vice President of Operations and Head of Manufacturing, Allen Horvath for his foresight on these topics and to all his staff for all the proactive actions that they took while the pandemic was in its early stages in the U.S."
11,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,11,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I would also like to specifically mention and say a special thanks to our manufacturing, warehouse and shipping staff, to their direct management and to our process and industrial engineers and our service and support teams for their extraordinary efforts during this difficult time, keeping our factory running and fulfilling orders. These are all clearly jobs and positions that cannot be accomplished working from home. And I'd like to thank those staff for adapting to the difficult situations imposed on them during this ongoing crisis. It's these critical staff who have allowed us to keep running."
12,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,12,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Also, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families in New Jersey, in nearby New York and all around the country who have been directly impacted by this horrible disease."
13,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,13,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As a result of our poor performance during 2019, the company began an active program in Q2 last year to identify and implement operational expense reductions and find ways to operate the business more efficiently. At the same time, we implemented significant sales team reorganizations and increased marketing efforts to support the range of new products and product features that we released during the year last year and preparing for those planned for 2020."
14,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,14,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"During the second half of the year last year, we incrementally reduced our OpEx by approximately $200,000 per month, and we have continued this work further in Q1 2020, ahead of the current COVID related situation. Although this work is not yet complete, we continue to develop further initiatives for balancing our OpEx with our projected revenue streams in 2020, and we are prepared to implement all possible actions towards ensuring the company returns to a predictable profitability as soon as the current market conditions allow."
15,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,15,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As COVID-related business impacts go, it's been a daily and weekly developing situation over the last 2 months. And we begin to see a small but specific -- sorry, we began to see a small but specific attributable slowdown in sales during the last week of February. That small initial impact grew each week through March and ultimately yielded an approximate 30% to 35% reduction in revenues last month versus our forecast. We have immediately responded to that impact with a combination of short-term-oriented expense reductions, including voluntary compensation reductions by all the company's management team, and we've delayed investments and costs."
16,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,16,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,We've also begun a process of renegotiating several supplier agreements for the specific purpose of allowing us to preserve operating capital and maintaining higher liquidity in the short term to help us through the immediate health and social crisis.
17,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,17,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On a positive note, the company has continued to be in very active and open and encouraging discussions with most of our service operator, distributor and integrator customers. By our last count, over 90% remained open for business and actively engaging with us on new purchases, new product and clinical discussions as well as prospective new programs, many of which are being planned -- are planned to deploy during the recovery period we expect."
18,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,18,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Further to this, the company separately announced this morning about closing yesterday afternoon of an $800,000 financing round in the form of a subordinated debt, 100% of which has been committed by a combination of company management and Board members. We are also in the process of evaluating additional financing options. Our CFO, Eric Skolnik, will cover details of this raise and associated benefits we've gained with our senior lender and more precise details following my remarks."
19,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,19,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The company has additionally been focused on understanding all potential government resources and programs recently made available for companies just like Blonder Tongue Labs dealing with the current crisis in the financial markets. We completed over last weekend and submitted an application this past Monday for the federal government's CARE (sic) [ CARES ] Act Paycheck Protection Program for a requested amount just over $1.7 million, that number being based upon -- calculated by us based on government guidelines. That application included a complete package of extensive supporting documentation."
20,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,20,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I do need to caution that the Paycheck Protection Program details, rules and requirements and the individual bank underwriting policies have been fast-moving topics. Both the company and local banks who are administering the program on behalf of the federal government have been on a steep learning curve since early last week."
21,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,21,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We can currently offer no assurances or guarantee to ourselves or our investors that Blonder Tongue will be supplied with any of these funds or any other government funds yet. Because of the material amounts involved in this program, we will be providing additional status and other information in the appropriate form: filings, press releases or both as we learn more. And I want to emphasize that we will be running the business now and going forward in the most conservative way possible under the assumption that we will not receive any additional funding sources."
22,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,22,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"During 2019, the company did accomplish a number of strategically important items, including expanded direct sales of our NXG digital signal processing platform to a number of large- and medium-sized service operators as well as product qualifications and significant progress in the sales process with additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 operators."
23,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,23,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We also completed and began to ship at the end of Q4 our world-class ClearView line of IP video transcoders that deliver fantastic video quality, high reliability and digital television compatibility features at an extremely competitive price point. Those are being actively shipped into a number of headend facilities around the country, and we anticipate that the ClearView products have the potential to regain at least a portion of our diminished sales in that sector that we lost in 2019."
24,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,24,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Our CPE program began shipping products to customers in February of 2019, and over the following 10 months, we secured direct business with over 45 different service operators. Although CPE has not yet contributed material profitability to the company, it has been important in repositioning the company more squarely as a provider of systems above and beyond our extremely high-quality and reliable transmission and signal processing equipment. We have since been in the process of promoting to those 45 new customers the wider range of Blonder Tongue equipment for managing their future video and high-speed data service delivery needs."
25,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,25,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"For 2020, we have begun programs aimed at streamlining and greatly improving our working relationships with all our major distribution channel and integration company customers. These are great companies that Blonder Tongue has, in some cases, multiple decade relationships with and who continue to be key partners in our potential future growth. These programs are in progress now with a fundamental goal of increasing the predictability of those portions of our revenue streams."
26,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,26,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Eric Skolnik. Eric?"

Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"The decrease in sales is primarily attributed to a decrease in sales of DOCSIS data products, digital video headend products, HFC distribution products and analog video headend products, offset by an increase in sales of NXG IP video signal processing products and CPE products.
