6,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,6,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll recap Simply Good Foods' second quarter highlights and provide you with some details on the performance of our Atkins and Quest brands.

7,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,7,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Before we get into the details of our Q2 results, I'd like to discuss the impacts we're seeing with respect to COVID-19. Overall, the first half of fiscal 2020, which ended on February 29, exceeded our expectations with no material impact from COVID-19. We entered the second half of the fiscal year with positive net sales momentum, solid cost containment and confidence in our ability to execute our plans and to deliver on the outlook we provided on our earnings on January 9. Furthermore, the Quest integration is on track and our synergy plans are proceeding as expected."
8,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,8,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In March, overall retail foot traffic was extremely volatile with the surge in the beginning of the month, followed by a significant slowdown in the second half of the month at most brick-and-mortar retailers. The retail takeaway trends of both our category and our brands followed a similar pattern."
9,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,9,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Given the likely continuing uncertainty around consumer purchasing behavior due to COVID-19 movement restrictions, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our fiscal 2020 full year guidance at this time. Our key priorities now are to safeguard the continued health of our employees and communities, ensure the reliability of our supply chain and provide accurate and timely service to our retail customers and consumers."
10,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,10,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are in close communication with our key customers and suppliers. And to date, our supply chain remains robust and fully operational. Our contract manufacturers are taking extra measures to ensure that they are providing their workers with a safe environment and are committed to meet the consumer and customer requirements of our business in the coming weeks and months."
11,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,11,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Next, we will do what's right for the long-term health of our employees, brands and business. Now let's move on to Slide 5 and discuss our fiscal second quarter results."
12,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,12,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Second quarter results were greater than our expectations as both Atkins and Quest delivered strong sales growth as well as gross and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Legacy Atkins' retail takeaway in the second quarter was generally in line with our estimates. Growth was driven by bars and confections across all channels. Additionally, Atkins' e-commerce momentum continued with sales up double digits."
13,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,13,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Quest's Q2 results were strong across all metrics and are tracking to our acquisition model. Integration work continued and is progressing on schedule. In our fiscal second quarter and for the year-to-date period, the nutritional snacking category increased mid to high single digits. The growth rate may move around a bit in the short term due to changing shopping behavior related to COVID-19 movement restrictions. But over the long term, we believe the megatrends that have fueled nutritious snacking categories such as healthy snacking, convenience, meal replacement and on-the-go consumption will continue to be tailwinds for our business and brands."
14,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,14,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In Atkins and Quest, we have 2 trusted advantaged lifestyle brands that target different consumer groups and position us to maintain our leadership role within the category. On a run rate apples-to-apples basis, we have a scaled business with net sales in excess of $900 million, and our outsourced supply chain enables solid margins, low CapEx and results in strong cash generation."
15,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,15,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The Atkins and Quest brands are tightly aligned around the consumer megatrends such as more frequent snacking occasions and the desire for on-the-go meal replacement. In addition, our products are uniquely positioned to benefit from growing consumer interest at high protein, low carb and minimal sugar. This profile has broad appeal to consumers interested in better-for-you as well as weight management and active nutrition shoppers looking to achieve their goal."
16,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,16,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And while we like the diversified forms on this page, bars, chips, shake, cookies and confections, we also have a solid R&D pipeline that we'll continue to work on and refine. This is an advantaged portfolio with solid margins and financial flexibility to invest in marketing to drive growth."
17,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,17,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Turning to the second quarter, net sales increased 83.4%. Legacy Atkins' net sales increased 12.1%, and as expected, outpaced the increase in retail takeaway due to our strong e-commerce growth as well as a slight seasonal inventory build. The contribution from Quest was a 71.3% benefit to net sales growth and grew strong double digits versus the comparable period a year ago."
18,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,18,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,The increase in adjusted EBITDA is a direct result of higher gross profit driven by higher Atkins net sales and the benefit of Quest. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by the timing of marketing we previously discussed.
19,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,19,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Total Simply Good Foods Company's second quarter and year-to-date retail takeaway in the IRI MULO measured outlet universe increased 11.8% and 13.6%, respectively. Note that this includes the traditional food, drug and mass merchandisers as well as Walmart, BJ's, Sam's and dollar stores. Additionally, IRI MULO captures about 90% of legacy Atkins' U.S. sales. However, it only represents about 50% of Quest's sales."
20,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,20,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Atkins' Q2 retail takeaway increased 6.1% with growth across all major channels. We are particularly pleased with our performance in the club channel, which was up strong double digits on a percentage basis versus last year. And Atkins' e-commerce business continues to do well, up about 60% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods with bars, shakes and confection all up double digits. And while early on, our momentum here has continued into Q3."
21,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,21,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Year-to-date, e-commerce represents nearly 7% of Atkins' total gross sales. We've doubled our e- commerce business over the last 2 years and anticipate continued growth over our strategic planning cycle. Quest's second quarter nutritional snacking growth was up about 27% driven by growth in food, mass and club channels. In nonmeasured channels, the specialty class of trade has been a headwind. This is a broader multiyear category issue and not specific to Quest. And given the COVID-19 movement restrictions, the specialty channel could be a greater headwind in the balance of fiscal 2020."
22,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,22,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The building blocks of Atkins' point-of-sale growth are similar to what we discussed over the last few years: strong base velocity growth. By form, year-to-date bars and confections retail takeaway growth remained strong, up about 8% and 31%, respectively. Shakes were off roughly 4% in the second quarter and the year-to-date period due to challenging year ago comps and other new branded product entries as well as a distribution loss of our 30-gram shake at a couple of retailers."
23,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,23,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As expected, base velocity in bars and confections was solid and distribution was down due to shakes as well as the decision we made last year to close some underperforming bar flavors to free up supply capacity. Promotional volume returned to more normalized levels following our scale back in fiscal 2019 due to supply constraint. Although this may not be the case in the second half of the year due to changing shopping behavior related to the COVID-19 situation, retailers are reevaluating the timing of shelf resets and promotion plans that may result in a delay or cancellation of some of our previous agreed to programs."
24,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,24,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Let me now turn to Quest. As a reminder, Quest is a uniquely positioned brand. The management team has done a great job transitioning its positioning from a high-protein bar brand to a broader healthy lifestyle snack brand focused on providing craveable food backed by metabolic science. About 2/3 of the business is the core protein snack bar with the remaining 1/3 consisting of fast-growing products such as protein chips, cookies and pizza. But no matter which product you consume, the nutritional profile is the same: high in protein, low in carb with minimal sugar."
25,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,25,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, Quest generates about half of its U.S. sales in the IRI MULO universe in traditional food, drug, mass and club channels. The other half of Quest's U.S. sales are generated in the convenience store class of trade and the unmeasured e-commerce and specialty channels, which are not tracked by IRI or MULO."
26,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,26,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Quest's year-to-date retail takeaway in the measured IRI MULO universe increased 27.6% with equally balanced gains from both base velocity and distribution gains. Growth across all major forms was up double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, including the important bar business, which increased 12.7% in measured channels."
27,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,27,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The Quest team continues to do a great job of driving awareness, consideration and trial via their sophisticated digital and social marketing efforts. The unique Quest Squad influencer network is effective in attracting and retaining core consumers. The presence across various social media platforms such as Instagram, where Quest has nearly 900,000 followers, has driven solid growth."
28,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,28,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And the Quest R&D team has recently launched some close-in flavor and line extensions as well as some new pack types such as the snack bar and 4-pack protein chips depicted on this slide. We're confident in our long-term growth plans for this business. It's a scaled lifestyle consumer brand and not just a single product. And like Atkins, it's backed by an underlying nutritional philosophy supported by science: high protein to improve strength and low carb and sugars to minimize blood sugar spike while providing a steady source of energy. Quest is in the early innings of growing brand awareness, consideration and trial, and we believe a significant runway exists for long-term growth."
29,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,29,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In summary, The Simply Good Foods Company competes in an attractive category and is a leader in that category. The combination of Atkins and Quest provides us with 2 uniquely positioned brands and a diversified portfolio that is aligned around the consumer megatrends of wellness snacking, convenience and meal replacement. We're operating our business for the long term and committed to do the right things for our employees, customers and consumers during this challenging time."
30,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,30,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now I'll turn the call over to Todd, who will provide you with some greater financial details."
31,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,31,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with 2 points as it relates to the numbers you see on the slides that follow. First, for comparative purposes, we will review financial statements with the 13 and 26 weeks ended February 29, 2020. Second, given our asset-light strong cash flow business model, we evaluate our performance on an adjusted basis as it relates to EBITDA and diluted earnings per share. We have included a detailed reconciliation from GAAP to adjusted historical items in today's press release. We believe these adjusted measures are a key indicator of the true underlying performance of the business."
32,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,32,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"I will begin with a review of our net sales drivers of growth. Second quarter U.S. legacy Atkins volume growth was 13%. Higher volume was partially offset by greater trade promotion resulting in total U.S. legacy Atkins net sales growth of 12%. As expected, this was greater than the retail takeaway growth of 6.1% given the continued strength of our nonmeasured e-commerce business as well as a slight seasonal inventory build. Legacy Atkins' non-U.S. net sales, including Canada and our international business, was up a healthy 13.5%. As a result, total organic net sales growth in the quarter was 12.1%. The Q2 Quest contribution was a 71.3% benefit resulting in total Q2 net sales increase of 83.4%."
33,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,33,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Now for a review of second quarter results across other major metrics. Gross profit was $85.4 million, an increase of $35.7 million or 72% driven by legacy Atkins' sales growth and the inclusion of Quest, partially offset by a noncash $5.1 million inventory purchase accounting step-up adjustment related to the Quest acquisition, which is now complete."
34,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,34,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As a result, gross margin was 37.6%, a 250 basis point decline versus last year. The noncash inventory step-up adversely impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. Quest's lower gross margin and the previously mentioned increase in trade promotions were a 30 basis point headwind."
35,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,35,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Input costs were relatively benign in the quarter and we expect only modest inflation for the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 81.7% to $41.7 million driven by the increase in gross profit partially offset by selling and marketing expenses, which increased 83.6% or $12.3 million to $27 million. The majority of the increase, about 75%, was due to the addition of Quest and the remainder driven by the timing of our higher legacy Atkins marketing expense as discussed previously. Additionally, G&A expenses increased by 82% in Q2, primarily attributable to Quest as legacy Atkins was relatively flat to the year ago period."
36,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,36,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to other items in the P&L. Interest expense increased $7.2 million to $10.6 million due to the than the year ago period of 24%. As a result, reported net income in Q2 was $10.7 million versus $12.7 million in the year ago period."
37,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,37,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Year-to-date results are as follows. As I indicated earlier, net sales was driven primarily by volume growth and the Quest acquisition. Gross profit was $147.6 million, an increase of $46 million or 45.3% driven by legacy Atkins sales growth and Quest. This was partially offset by the noncash $7.5 million inventory purchase accounting step-up adjustment related to the Quest acquisition. As a result, gross margin was 38.9%, a 260 basis point decline versus last year. The noncash inventory step-up adversely impacted year-to-date gross margin by 200 basis points. Quest's lower gross margin and the previously mentioned increase in trade promotions were a 60 basis point headwind."
38,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,38,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Adjusted EBITDA increased 48% to $73.5 million driven by the increase in gross profit, partially offset by selling and marketing expenses, which increased 51.3% or $15.4 million to $45.5 million. The majority of the increase, about 75%, was due to the acquisition of Quest and the timing of higher legacy Atkins marketing expenses as discussed previously. Additionally, G&A expenses increased $14.5 million to $36.6 million primarily attributable to Quest and higher legacy Atkins employee-related costs. Business transaction costs were $26.9 million and primarily associated with Quest acquisition."
39,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,39,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to the other items in the P&L. The net impact of interest income and interest expense was an increase of $9 million due to the increase in the term loan balance. Year-to-date income tax expense was $2.2 million versus $8.7 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2020, we anticipate an effective tax rate of around 26%. As a result, Q2 year-to-date reported net income was $5.9 million versus $28 million last year."
40,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,40,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Now turning to earnings per share. In the second quarter of 2020, the company reported $0.11 per share diluted compared with $0.15 per share diluted for the comparable period of 2019. The Q2 year-over-year change was impacted by the noncash inventory step-up of $5.1 million, integration costs of $3.9 million and business combination costs of around $700,000. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.23, an increase of $0.05 versus the year ago period. Note that we calculated adjusted diluted EPS as adjusted EBITDA less interest income, interest expense and income taxes."
41,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,41,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Year-to-date reported EPS was $0.06 versus $0.33 per share diluted in the prior year impacted by the noncash inventory step-up of $7.5 million, integration costs of $5.3 million and business combination costs of $26.9 million. Year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.45, an increase of $0.06 versus the year ago period. Please refer to today's press release for an explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures."
42,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,42,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flows. Year-to-date, we paid down $21 million of term loans. And at quarter end, the outstanding term loan balance was $635.5 million. Given our cash balance and our outstanding term loan balance at the end of the second quarter, we are well on track to achieving our trailing 12-month net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of less than 3.7x by fiscal year-end 2020."
43,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,43,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 crisis, in March, the company began to increase finished goods inventory of some of its high-velocity products. In conjunction with this as well as for other working capital and general corporate purposes, the company drew down $25 million of the $75 million available under its revolving credit facility."
44,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,44,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The company believes it is in a strong liquidity position. And at the end of March, the company's estimated cash balance was about $80 million. We anticipate the net impact of interest income and interest expense to be in the $33 million to $35 million range, an increase of $1 million versus our previous estimate due to the drawdown of the revolver."
45,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,45,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Year-to-date depreciation and amortization was $7.1 million and capital expenditures were about $0.5 million. CapEx for fiscal 2020 is expected to be about $5 million, driven primarily by the ERP implementation."
46,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,46,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,Let me now provide you with a brief update on the Quest integration. The identified cost synergies of $20 million are on track and will begin to materially flow through the -- in fiscal year 2021. The major parts of the integration work stream are well underway and tracking with our plan.
47,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,47,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Specifically, the supply chain team is working on an integrated approach to procurement, distribution and warehousing. Work and discussions with vendors are proceeding as planned. Additionally, the Quest and Atkins IT teams are working collaboratively on ERP implementation onto Quest's existing platform. To date, we're on schedule and haven't encountered any major obstacles. Despite the challenges of everyone working remotely, this is one of our top priorities and the integration steering committee is in constant communication to ensure that we're progressing on our time line."
48,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,48,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,I would now like to turn the call back to Joe for closing remarks.
49,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,49,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Todd. As I previously stated, our first half of fiscal 2020 performance exceeded our expectations. And as we began the second half of the year, we were confident in our ability to achieve our previously communicated fiscal year 2020 outlook."
50,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,50,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"However, in March, retail foot traffic was volatile. Retail takeaway of our products was very strong in the first half of the month, followed by a notable slowdown thereafter, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the current consumer purchasing behavior due to COVID-19. The severity and duration of the current situation is uncertain and will likely continue during much of the second half of our fiscal 2020."
51,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,51,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Therefore, given the rapidly evolving situation and the uncertainty related to the potential effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, we believe it is prudent to withdraw our previously communicated fiscal 2020 outlook. We will continue to monitor this situation, and we'll provide additional perspective on the year during our fiscal third quarter conference call in early July."
52,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,52,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As I mentioned earlier, we're fortunate to participate in the category that has so many positive underlying growth characteristics. We believe that health and wellness will continue to be an important part of consumers' lives that the megatrends related to healthy snacking, convenience, meal replacement and on-the-go eating are long-term trends and that the low household penetration of this category will be a tailwind for our business for years to come. As such, we believe and have confidence in the long-term growth prospects of our brands and our business."
53,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,53,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, I want to extend my appreciation during these unique times. First, thank you to our employees in Denver, El Segundo and around the world. They have adjusted remarkably well to their new remote work environment. Despite juggling multiple new challenges at home, they have continued to collaborate well and execute superbly."
54,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,54,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Second, I want to thank the leadership teams of Simply Good and Quest as well as our Board of Directors. With their continued guidance and leadership, I'm confident we will navigate the short-term challenges of this situation while positioning the business for continued long-term growth. We appreciate everyone's interest in our company and are now available to take your questions."
