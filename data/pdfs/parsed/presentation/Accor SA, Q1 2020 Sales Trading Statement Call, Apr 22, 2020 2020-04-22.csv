0,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,0,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Sébastien Bazin, Chairman and CEO, to begin today's conference. Thank you."
1,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,1,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for connecting yourself to the first quarter revenue results for Accor."
2,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,2,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So we're going to go swiftly on the numbers of pages. If you could go to Page #4, where you have the global map of the world, which you obviously see first with the red dot is where the epidemic is unfortunately present and growing in many of those jurisdictions. And the title says that, I guess, 90% of Accor hotels globally are either closed for business or they close for booking, and mini centers owners for insurance and other reasons wants the hotel to be maintained open even though there is no occupancy."
3,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,3,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"If you want to have a precise number, the numbers are following as of last night: We have 3,142 hotels being closed out of a network of 5,085, which is 62% of the portfolio is closed. Closed, meaning really, basically, with nobody except maybe somebody on the maintenance side."
4,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,4,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"That number varies quite a bit in between regions. So I'll give you the 5 big regions for Accor. Europe, we have 2,330 (sic) [ 23,330 ] hotels being closed out of 30,545, which is 77% of the hotels are closed. In Asia Pacific, 311 of hotels are closed out of a network of 1,225. Only 25% of the hotel are closed. Notice is made that 100% of the hotel in China are today back and reopened. South America, 277 hotels are today closed out of a network of 397, which is 48% -- sorry, in South America, first. Sorry, I went too quickly. South America, 277 closed out of a network of 397, i.e., 70%. Middle East and Africa, 135 hotel being closed out of a network of 296, i.e., 46% being closed. And North America and Canada, 89 hotel are closed out of a network of 122, i.e., 73% of the hotels are closed."
5,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,5,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"If you go to the next page, which is Page #5. What you have here is, obviously, the 2 column. On the left column is something which all of you know to the risk of being dead drunk is as of the last few days' consensus, we're looking for a negative growth GDP worldwide of minus 3%. We're looking for a lot of government stimulus packages being made on a national level, which is, in many instances, way higher than 5% of the local GDP. And you have -- in addition to what the national government may and might do, you have liquidity being provided by the 2 major central banks. The European central banks, which is today offer EUR 1.1 trillion; and you have the Fed injecting EUR 2.3 trillion as of the last few days. Of course, those numbers varies on a weekly basis."
6,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,6,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"What you have on the right side is what could be claimed as being direct support to the financial -- to the travel and leisure industry. You have some tax deferral. You have some social charges either being extended or likely to be canceled. It's going to be on a case-by-case basis and, of course, on a country- by-country basis. And you have a lot of reimbursement deferral of booking cancellation. Again, varies quite a bit in different geographies."
7,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,7,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Indirect support subsidies for the furlough. As you know, Accor has furloughed 210,000 employees under Accor branch. And of course, they've been stipulated over the last few weeks. It's -- not only varies, but it is extraordinary different in between workers in Continental Europe being maintained at 85% plus of the last month salary, and in other jurisdiction being as low as 20% of what you could have been compensated at the week before or the month before."
8,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,8,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And you have a progressive deconfinement being done in different countries. You know it's been happening in China. It's been happening in the last 4, 5 days in South Korea. The case in Scandinavia, in most of those countries, in Slovenia. In Austria, next week. Likely in Germany. So we go back to this maybe on your Q&A."
9,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,9,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The one thing which is not on the slide here because we've been digging on those. What experts do say is the international tourist arrivals in the world likely to be down between 20% and 30% in 2019. I'm assuming that, that 20% to 30% is on an asset of 1.5 billion, which is a number of international travelers that we have experienced in 2019. That number may be low, by the way, because if we don't reopen any frontiers, my assessment would be probably more bearish than what I see from -- I believe it's WTTC."
10,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,10,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the next page, which is Page 6, you go on 2 columns as well. Title says -- and we've been saying it quite a bit on -- the asset-light profiles company is clearly a true asset in terms of ability to weather the storm. On the left side, we talk about the balance sheet with the management of our own debt and cash liability and debt profile. We have ample cash position immediately accessible if there were any need for it of EUR 2.5 billion at the end of March 22 without accounting for EUR 1.2 billion of an existing revolver credit line in which we had successfully renegotiated and obtained waivers or, i.e., holidays, on any covenant testing delayed by a year until June 2021."
11,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,11,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the right side on cash preservation, a lot of protection measures have been done and, obviously, worked on since mid-March on G&A reduction by EUR 60 million out of the total G&A package, and we can go back on your Q&A. We -- Jean-Jacques and myself, we, of course, have been trying to adapt as quickly as we could the reduction of the cost, trying to offset the drastic expected fee reduction when it comes to sales, marketing, distribution and loyalty, how could we and adapt to what is likely to be missing and trying to reduce as much as we can and as quickly as we can all those costs associated with SMDL."
12,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,12,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Reducing, of course, CapEx, which is 1/3 by EUR 60 million. You've seen that we have suspended the dividend of EUR 280 million and have renounced to continuing the share buyback in excess of what's being done in the first quarter, which was EUR 300 million. And of course, it's looking every day, and probably a couple of times a day, even though we do have ample liquidity on what is the cash needed for -- in the 110 countries of Accor and to make sure the guests we know that number every day passing and start with the EUR 2.5 billion as of end of March."
13,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,13,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"That's where we are from my introduction. I'll leave the floor to Jean-Jacques, and I'll come back to you on the conclusion. JJ?"
14,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,14,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Hello. Thank you, Sébastien. Hello, everybody. On this call, we traditionally comment revenue development RevPAR, but we don't discuss earnings. Today, given the COVID-19 environment, we decided that we would provide to you some color on the effect of the COVID-19 on the EBITDA on the basis of the Q1 actuals. We would, nevertheless, like to remind you that visibility is currently not high enough for the group to estimate the financial impact of the crisis on the result financial position for the full year of 2020."
15,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,15,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"But let's start on Page 8 with the Q1 2020 takeaways. On the RevPAR, the business update, so in terms of business update, RevPAR was down 25.4% over the quarter. And we've a point in March, which was 62.7% negative. More on the sunny side of the street, the development was good, and we were able to add to our portfolio 8,000 new rooms. This reflects the resilience of the model and the net system growth for the last 12 months, is to the tune of 5.2%. We also signed 8,000 room in Q1, which means that our pipeline was stable at 2,000 or 8,000 room -- 208,000, sorry, room. These numbers, this business, translates into the following financial at revenue level. We have a group revenue at EUR 768 million, i.e., a decrease of 15.8% like-for-like, and we see the management and franchise revenue of it being down by 34.9% at the level of EUR 150 million. I'll detail that later on."
16,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,16,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If we move to the next page, just a little bit more details on the network and pipeline by region, so the classical chart that we would do every quarter. So as I said, we opened 8,000 rooms. Just to give you an idea of the noticeable openings, there is the Fairmont San Juan in Puerto Rico for close to 400 rooms. You've got Mövenpick Stuttgart Messe in Germany for 260 rooms. That was opened in Jan. And then in the U.S., we launched 21c in Chicago of 300 rooms, which was opened in February. Just in terms of bigger numbers, Asia Pacific accounted for half of the openings, which is a situation that we've been seeing for now many, many quarters."
17,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,17,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We also signed 8,000 rooms, so the pipeline is stable, as I said. But the one thing which is also good is that the churn remain in a sound range. We are below 2%, and so that's also a good result in terms of the evolution of the portfolio."
18,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,18,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Given the exceptional economic conditions, some of -- some owner may cite difficulty to finance new projects. Some building works are being delayed as we see it. So that will affect the room growth. And so probably, we should see -- we would see a number for the full year 2020 which is going to be below the 5% guidance that we have been providing for several years in a row now. I would like to highlight that these projects are postponed but not canceled, as much as we can see."
19,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,19,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So moving to the next page, you have here the overview of the RevPAR for the key geographies. So Europe and Asia Pacific account for close to 75% of the business than the rest of the world and the -- than the total group. And you see very well on those curves the dynamic of the pandemic, which started in Asia Pacific, hence the number in Asia Pacific at minus 34% is the worst. Then it came to Europe, where you are at minus 23.2% for the Q1 '20 numbers. And expanded in the rest of the world with only a spot which is less affected than the rest of the world, which is South America, and that translates into the group number."
20,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,20,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Let me go into a bit more detail. In Asia Pacific, Greater China, which is the pandemic epicenter, was the most impacted, and you have there a RevPAR for Q1 at minus 68%. The RevPAR, in fact, in March was still very negative at minus 53%, but we see a little bit of improvement in the occupancy level, which is the sign of what you can read in the press, in the news, i.e., that there is some turnaround there. And so the occupation that we have in our hotels, which used to be at 11% in February, doubled in March to a level of 23%. So that's good."
21,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,21,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If you look at the other big element in Asia Pacific, you've got Australia, which posted 18% RevPAR in Q1. And again, here, it reflects the fact that the pandemia has been going to Australia with some delay and also the fact that some of the hotels there have been used right from the start for quarantine. This is only a short-term impact, but it's a positive impact."
22,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,22,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If you move to Europe, you've got here a very sharp deterioration that started 1 month later at the end of Feb for most countries. And you see France posting a minus 22% RevPAR, Germany posting a minus 25% RevPAR, the U.K. posting a minus 22% RevPAR. So everybody is in the same ballpark. And in each of those countries, lockdown were put in place at about the same time, somewhere between the 17th of March for France. And for the U.K., it's ended up being the 23rd of March. So all of that is very similar in nature and in numbers. And frankly, there is not much difference between London and the province or between Paris and the province. We really have here, unfortunately, the same global patterns."
23,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,23,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As for the rest of the world, NCA and Middle East and Africa are following similar trends. They, in fact, have RevPAR to the tune of 22% and 21%, respectively, so very much in line with what you saw for the at 11%, and again because of the lag in pandemic spreading at this juncture."
24,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,24,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And there is nothing quotable on the mix by segment. This is across segment. This is across geography. It's just a question of when the pandemic is hitting the geography, which is generating the numbers -- of the impact, I should say."
25,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,25,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If we move now not to RevPAR but to revenue, which is the Slide 11, you can see the revenue. The total revenue was EUR 768 million, which is minus 15.8% like-for-like growth. The reported growth is at 17%, and there is a small effect on -- sorry, perimeter with the Mövenpick portfolio -- lease portfolio sale, a little bit of currency, but de minimis, frankly."
26,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,26,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As for hotel asset as a segment, the revenue was down 17.5% on the like-for-like basis. I mentioned a 25.4% RevPAR, so the explanation and the link between the 17.5% and the 25.4% is as follows. You see the M&F, the portion of hotel service which is management and franchise fees, which is a very sharp drop of minus 35%. I'll detail that in the upcoming slide."
27,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,27,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And you see, on the other hand, the service to owner remainder of hotel asset -- hotel services, sorry, which only shows a decrease of 8%, hence the average at 17.5%. And the reason for that is that STO, service to owner, as you may recall, is done of 2 buckets. One is sales, marketing, distribution and loyalty, and this one has been behaving just like the RevPAR decline, as you would expect; and then you've got reimbursed cost, which is the people that we have in hotels and that are, in fact, that we carry in the hotels that are not our people. And so we basically have those costs in the period and get the revenue for the same amount to the euro in the same period. And so those people were only furloughed at the end of March, and hence, there was not such a decrease of the reimbursed cost year-on-year. Hence the fact that STO in average was only down 8% when the RevPAR was down 25%. A little bit of technical explanation, but this is quite significant variances to be explained."
28,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,28,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As for hotel assets, it's much easier. It's essentially -- the numbers reflect the geography. As I told you, Australia and Brazil have been enjoying a relatively milder pandemia up to now, hence the relative resilience of the number in hotel asset, essentially Australia and Brazil."
29,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,29,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,New business is down 13.8%. Nothing here to report. And the Holding and Interco are reflecting the sale of Orbis and the Mövenpick lease portfolio that you surely remember we concluded in Q1 2020.
30,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,30,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If you move to the next page, which is the drill down in the hotel service business of the management and franchise revenue. Two points really to mention on that table. Number one, the RevPAR being 25.4%, why is it that the revenue is higher to the tune of 34.9%? This is, in fact, coming from incentive fees. As you surely recall, there is a portion of our management and franchisee fees which are incentive. As the business is not there, the hotel profit is not there. And hence, the incentive is not at the same level as what you would have last year. As a rule of thumb, it has been dropping at twice the level of RevPAR. Then the other discrepancy that you may see on the table by region is essentially the reflection again of how the COVID-19 has been spreading over geography over time. So South America is better and Asia Pacific is worse. This is essentially the explanation on that table."
31,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,31,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Now last but not the least, COVID-19. So we provided to you some numbers at the end of February as part of a business update, and we wanted here on the basis of what we see in our accounts give you an update of the COVID-19 effect and versus what you could have expected on a normalized year. We have a gap, which is estimated to EUR 170 million year-on-year coming from the COVID-19. One very important point in that number and to understand that number is we discussed and we sent a press release that was explaining some of the cost measure that Sébastien summarized at the beginning of the page. These cost savings were mostly implemented at the end of March. So that number doesn't account for the cost savings that we've been putting in place, and you should see those cost savings topping up in the months of April, May and June."
32,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,32,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Another thing that we would like to help clarify in giving you as much as we have on that crisis and the effect of it on our financial is that if you do a rule of thumb on those numbers, you could infer that 1 point of RevPAR is about EUR 28 million of EBITDA. That's a much different number than any of the numbers we may have discussed in history, granted that we are in a much different situation than any situation we've of RevPAR is equivalent to EUR 7 million of EBITDA when you are on positive RevPAR in a bracket of 0% to 3%. And then that you are at minus EUR 12 million when you are on a RevPAR which is negative, again, in a bracket which is 3% to 4% to 5% of negative RevPAR. So that's about the rule of thumb that we've been using. They don't really apply anymore when you are in extreme RevPAR drop environment like the one we face. Why is that?"
33,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,33,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our business model is based on scalability of the activity. We went through that. We explained the virtuous circle back in the Capital Market Day in 2018. This model is based on the following cost structure. Management and franchise holding costs grew with inflation. Sales, marketing, distribution and loyalty costs, which are part of service to owner, our expense to the tune of the fee received from the hotel owner. And then you've got those reimbursed costs that I was alluding to, which are also part of STO and our true pass-through. I get reimbursed for the amount of payroll that I have to pay to the people that were in the hotel on behalf of the hotel owners. And then there is another leg to it, which is the remainder of the group that is still asset heavy. And in our case, it's mostly Mantra."
34,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,34,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So now how does the RevPAR variation we are facing affecting that model? I mean sales, marketing, distribution, loyalty cannot be flexed in line with revenue. And in fact, our assessment is that there is about 50% of the costs which are variable. And you can easily understand that by thinking that in sales, marketing, distribution, loyalty, you've got IT infrastructure as an example. So whether you are working or not working, I'll take an example that everybody will understand, you still pay the regular licenses of Microsoft and you still have your depreciation for the system that you've been developing."
35,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,35,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"When I turn to M&F on holding costs, so management and franchise holding costs, instead of letting them grow with inflation, we are taking actions. And Sébastien mentioned the EUR 60-plus million reduction that we're going to do on those costs, and those costs are essentially the headquarter costs whether here in Paris or in the regions, where you have all the people that are basically managing and helping the franchising of all the hotels in the field."
36,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,36,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And just on the last point, which is Mantra. We did mention to you back in February a EUR 40 million impact for 10 points of RevPAR when we published the year-end accounts, so that's about EUR 4 million for 1 point, and that's also in that sensitivity to be taken into account."
37,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,37,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So once you take all what I have said into account and you see the implement -- you see through the implementation of the appropriate cost savings as we've been developing the plan, our best estimate today is that for 1 point of RevPAR for the current year, we should be slightly north of EUR 20 million of EBITDA. Just wanted to give you that read of where we see those numbers are being able to be interpreted, and we will diligently work on the cost reduction plan."
38,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,38,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"With that, I leave the floor to Sébastien for some closing remarks."
39,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,39,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the page after, again 3 columns. On the first one, which is, as a matter of introduction and background, many of you know that -- and I did allude to on the 200,000-plus employees being furlough between the 22nd of March and the 1st of April. Considering that decision, which was not only drastic but extraordinary quick to be activated because it took us 10 days for those people not to be back at work exactly 1 week after being noticed, the Board decided to have that 25% of the nonpaid dividend, i.e., EUR 70 million, dedicated in, what you see in orange, the ALL Heartist Fund. That EUR 70 million, which is column #2, is really there as I mentioned it to those employees or individual partners on a case-by-case and in all the geographies of Accor."
40,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,40,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On top of what has been done on that fund, which is currently being activated in the hands of local CEOs with a very disciplined compliance, cumbersome reporting because it is, at the end, the money of our investors and looked after by the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, of which, by the way, we meet with them now every week for the last 1.5 months as opposed to every 5 to 6 weeks. So do we with the Executive Committee, of course, of this company. All of that by a visual conference, of course."
41,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,41,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the last column on the right is in addition to what we've been doing for the employees, partners and others, you know that in many, many jurisdictions, actually started in China, in Wuhan and other places in which Accor has been a caretaker and a provider of our own hotel facilities to the benefit of hospital, doctors, nurses, medics, any army who needs basically to be hosted. We're doing it in France. We actually launched a reservation platform called CEDA, which is COVID Emergency Desk Accor, in which we already have 30,000 nights paid for at cost by the French government authorities to welcome all of those who need to be hosted next to the hospital. We're doing the same thing in the U.K. for 60 hotels. Doing same thing in South America. Likely doing the same thing in Canada. So while our hotels are being closed, we actually make use of them voluntarily by each owners of Accor, have to of course agree that those premises will be made available to make sure we can battle the crisis and rebound as early as we can. So it's not only solidarity, but it's really trying to cope and trying to get the timing as quick as possible to come out of it."
42,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,42,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The next slide, it's something which should be of no surprise to you, but we used it for the Board of Directors and for own assessment on how dependent are we from international market, how dependent are we from the reopening of either national borders or international borders. You see that from the left to the right, no surprise to you. And that's Accor average number for 2019, by the way. So in Canada, 70% or mostly all the Fairmont Hotels occupation last year has been 70% Canadian nationals. Number is extremely high for America, which is 97% of our guest profile in America happened to be Americans. 75% in Brazil. You see a bit less 66% in the U.K. And you see Germany and France kind of actually 53% and 64%. Be minded, though, that, I guess, if you look for intra-continental Europe for both Germany and France, that number is way above 80%, people coming from Netherlands or from Belgium, from Spain, for that matter. So huge domestic and huge intra-continent. A notable exception of UAE at 20%. China, 82%. To pause a minute on this."
43,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,43,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I told you that all the hotels of Accor are today reopen. It's -- today, 97% of the traffic we have, of course, in China is made of Chinese nationals. And lesson there is because, as you know, we still have a 5% participation in Huazhu, which is our second largest hotel operator in China, in which I'm a Board member of. They run, as of last night, at 67% occupancy, and they only we opened 2.5 weeks ago. So certainly, quicker, better and faster in the economic affordable segment. And we don't see that 67% in the mid- scale, upscale segment. It's gradually getting better, but it's still into the low 20s and not yet into the 50s, but we opened 10 days after Huazhu. And Indonesia, 71%. And Australia, of no surprise, is an 83% domestic market."

Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So it's just only to share with you that within the large countries, if we were to reopen as we will, then we probably -- and if national government permits it. Certainly, for France, and I'll touch upon it 1 minute, as you know, we have 67 million people in France, likely not going anywhere else other than France over the last -- over the next 60 days. France is such an extraordinary country. There is a number of opportunity for the French national to discover the French regions and then stay in the Accor network and many other hoteliers in France. That is the case for U.K. and many other countries, by the way."
45,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,45,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the last slide, and then we'll get to you on the Q&A, there's 3 forwards here which is -- means looking at. One is caring, caring for somebody. This is the nature of what we do, which is why we're doing so much for the frontline, mission-critical workers today. And the second word is, of course, reassuring. We are going to be reopening hotels. It's going to come back. But of course, it's likely to be different. And a lot of our employees and a lot of our clients are going to want to be reassured and want to have proof of it in terms of health condition, in terms of procedures and in terms of methodology. For the employees, of course, and you've heard what I said, looking after them and certainly knowing how we can help."
46,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,46,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Guests, we're reaching out to all of them on a daily, weekly -- on a daily and weekly basis. Owners, never been closer than ever to them. We have multiple offices in multiple jurisdictions, and it's just one phone call away and no longer a visit, but super close. Partners, it's -- goes without saying, shareholders, is we taking all the mitigation measures we can, thinking out of the box, stopping projects, cutting costs, furloughing people, a lot of things that, I guess, we may go into further details. But believe me, we've been tackling and basically turning every stone over, trying to make sure when you don't have the revenues, you have to cut the cost. There's no other measures."
47,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",Presentation,47,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And then there is this alignment, which is tough on responding to urgency, which has been the last 60 days and likely to remain over the next 45, 60 days. But in the meantime, you have to plan for the future because you need the energy to be still at a high level. You need to prepare for the rebound. You need to design it. You need to be closer to the government agency, to the health authorities to make sure they don't impose on you something which is going to be determent to your business, and you need to be an actor and not a spectator and proactively engage and prepare for that recovery, as we do. We just simply don't know when that is. But I can tell you, we will be well prepared when that date will come. Let's go now to any of you on the Q&A session. Thank you very much."
