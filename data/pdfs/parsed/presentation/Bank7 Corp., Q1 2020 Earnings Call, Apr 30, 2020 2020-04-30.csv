We begin by acknowledging the pain that's inflicted upon our fellow citizens in country, especially our friends in places like New York, who've been hit especially hard. We support and appreciate the efforts being made all across the country, especially the work of our medical professionals and first-line defenders, and we stand together to defeat and overcome the terrible pandemic. It truly it is a terrible time."
6,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,6,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"It's also wonderful to see so many aspects of American exceptionalism coming together. Government policies, the treasury department, the SBA, the USDA, the state banking department, the Federal Reserve, everyone working closely with citizens in the private sector. We're grateful for everyone's efforts."
7,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I'd like to take a moment to congratulate and thank the Bank7 team members for their tireless work.
8,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,We truly have an exceptional company. Our plan to work remotely was put in place very quickly and has functioned very well. Our operations and IT groups have us working seamlessly. We're very proud of their efforts.
9,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I also want to thank Jason Estes, our Chief Credit Officer, and the entire centralized credit function. They quickly and professionally enabled us to handle loan modifications in the new PPP loans in a very efficient manner."
10,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Last but not least, our lenders and their support staff in every location have done an excellent job, and I personally have received many calls and e-mails from customers thanking us, and frankly, noncustomers who bank at large banks but who had asked us for help, the strength of community banking is revealing itself yet again."
11,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are certainly aware that in a matter of weeks, our country changed from a vibrant and booming economy to one with severe economic stress. After all is said and done, we expect to had experienced the most sudden and severe recession in the modern history of our country. There is no consensus on how far we will fall, and no one has ever predicted or encountered the speed at which GDP and unemployment have been negatively impacted."
12,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We also know that this pandemic-induced stress has caused an immediate and severe liquidity crunch, which is now morphed into a credit crisis. What is very important to remember is this stress began as a liquidity event, not underlying credit issues unlike 2008, when the banking system was burdened with excessive leverage, especially when you include off-balance sheet items. The industry entered into this period with extreme strength."
13,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Clearly, challenges are everywhere. Our industry will face increased credit risk, margin pressure, stress to our customers and team members and additional threats related to IT intrusions and cybercrimes. Regardless, we remain very focused on our credit book, liquidity, capital levels, expense discipline and internal operations. We have closely analyzed our extreme stress scenarios and are using those in conjunction with our deep transactional knowledge. That's what guides us."
14,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are comforted most by the thorough involvement between experienced credit executives who work with lenders and their customers. Our stress scenario is very severe. And if it materializes, we remain confident of our revenue stream and the shock absorption capability of earnings and capital. This is why we expect to continue to pay our dividend. However, we will watch very closely as we move through the next weeks and few months. We will continue to provide timely quality information, but we also know events are unfolding and happening at a rapid pace, so it will take continuous effort."
15,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now let's move into our data. Our focus will be on pretax, pre-provision earnings and how that combines with our already strong capital cushion to provide strength to our already strong balance sheet. Reflecting back to the January earnings call, we were very excited about 2020, which was largely due to our strong loan pipeline, some of which had already been booked. Our projected loan growth for the first quarter did in fact occur. Therefore, our results reflect what we had anticipated a very solid quarter. Our pretax, pre- provision income was very high and consistent with our history."
16,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In our slide deck, we have highlighted one of the great strengths -- one of our great strengths, our wide profit margin. It rapidly adds to our already robust capital levels. Therefore, even with the uncertain future, we are comforted that we will continue to add to our equity cushion. We are very proud of our strength in this area. In the current financial market of environment of ""shoot first, ask questions later,"" let's start with a refresher on Bank7 and how we were built on tried and true fundamentals."
17,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We're a company that provides commercial banking services to companies and their owners. In fact, 98% of our loans are commercial-purpose loans. We deliver the products and services using a branch-like model. Bank7 and its bankers are very close to customers. We're relationship bankers, not transactional bankers. We have virtually no participations or Shared National Credits. We have decades of successful improving credit discipline that has enabled us to avoid meaningful losses. We typically stay away from prevalent throughout our loan book, and that is one of the contributing factors to our historically low net charge-offs."
18,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Essentially, it is more of a needs-based loan book, not a flashy one. You can easily glean that when you review our home construction loan metrics and our hospitality loan book. We consistently maintain a strong NIM. And those factors, combined with our superb efficiency ratio and revenue per employee metrics to produce those wide margins and consistently strong profits which provides our healthy shock absorption cushion. The result is high levels of capital with 98% of our capital being tangible capital, good old-fashioned common stock and retained earnings. I would also add that we remain debt-free. In addition, we also maintained very strong on balance sheet liquidity."
19,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So now let's take a minute and review just a few of those fundamental components, and we'll start with capital. We entered into this pandemic-induced period of uncertainty with very high levels of capital. Included in our slide deck are 2 very important illustration: one that illustrates a significant cushion of capital and the other being a comparison of our pretax, pre-provision run rate as compared to 192 of the smaller exchange-traded banks. You can see our margins are far better. Again, not only did we enter the current crisis with heavy capital levels, our strong margin rapidly adds to our capital base, much faster than most other banks. We are very mindful that the near-term future is full of uncertainty. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our capital strength. The combined efforts from government, the Fed, private industry customers and teammates will enable us to successfully work through the upcoming months and prevent us from experiencing a negative impact to our capital base. Our confidence is further evidenced by the fact that none of the shares owned by our insiders have been sold, not one share. We have far more at stake in this company than anyone else."
20,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now if we move into another primary component, our net interest margin. We constantly maintain an excellent NIM. As highlighted in our January call, the fourth quarter NIM was very strong, and we had expected that strength to carry into 2020. However, none of us anticipated the sharp and sudden decline in interest rates. Looking forward into the rest of the year, the industry and Bank7 will experience downward pressure on NIM, with most of the pressure appearing in the latter part of the year. Nonetheless, we still expect to maintain our NIM within historical ranges. And remember, we achieved that by being disciplined with our floors. In fact, based on the most recent Fed rate cut, 92% of our loans are either fixed or already at their floors."
21,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our customer relationships are strong and deep, and our customers know we are reliable partners. And when absolute borrowing rates are this low, there is less pressure from them to lower rates. We also did not allow lenders to negotiate lower rates or floors without executive management involvement and oversight. Each customer requesting a rate or floor reduction is logged into a spreadsheet maintained by the finance department, and each request is evaluated by the lender and executive management. For the first quarter, we had $55 million of loans, which is 7% in the portfolio that was repriced downward at an average repricing downward of 82 basis points. And remember, during this time, the Fed dropped rates by 150 basis points."
22,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So now let's spend a minute on liquidity. Bank7 has historically maintained very good liquidity, typically holding between $75 million and $125 million of cash at the Fed, which is a very substantial amount of money for a company our size, and we continue to operate in that manner. This pandemic-induced stress clearly began as a liquidity event, which quickly morphed into a systemic credit crisis."
23,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Having said that, this clearly is not your father or grandfather's liquidity crisis. The U.S. government and Fed interventions are unprecedented, far-reaching, spread across the board, and those actions combined with a fully entrenched digital electronic currency system have clearly calmed the markets. For the consumer segment, the ability to instantly and seamlessly provide funds to pay for goods and services have significantly reduced consumer panic, which is a good thing, as consumer sentiment is fragile, but will be critical to help the economy recover. After all, 70% of GDP is consumer spending."
24,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Lawmakers, the treasury department, the state banking department and the Fed have demonstrated their commitment to provide multiple backstops to the entire monetary system, and that has added stability to the markets. In fact, when you look at the Fed's most recent H8 data, it is quite revealing. On a year- over-year basis, commercial loans are up in the 25% range, pretty much unprecedented."
25,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"You may ask how the loan growth comment relates to liquidity, and that is due to many companies drawing on credit facilities and simply redepositing the money into the banking system. That same H8 data shows annualized deposit growth on a year-over-year basis that is also in the double digits, the strongest anyone can remember. The Fed actions and U.S. government programs are temporarily propping up the economy. And ironically, the liquidity crisis is quickly abated as evidenced by so much money that's ended up in the U.S. banking system."
26,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On top of all of that, the global flight to safety has caused international liquidity to flow into the U.S. and our banking system, with liquidity being sufficient, the long hard work of economic recovery will soon begin. I would argue it's already begun. Another tool to support liquidity is the new Fed funding facility for our PPP loans, which we are utilizing and taking full advantage of, and that allows us to preserve our liquidity for normal banking needs."
27,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Last but not least is credit quality. We are mostly in uncharted waters. However, there are a few moments in history that can help us understand what a recovery might look like. We can refer to the devastating floods in Houston, events such as Hurricane Katrina. In those cases, the insurance industry provided a major backstop compared to today when the government programs and tax policy which will be the primary drivers to help with recovery. We realize this pandemic is far-reaching in different. Nonetheless, we remain confident that our asset quality will remain relatively strong as our underwriting principles and long-time customer relationships have always carried us through the toughest of times."
28,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our confidence is also based on one primary underlying assumption, which is that the pandemic induced stress is a near-term to medium-term event with America returning to a more normalized environment sooner rather than later. Clearly, a longer period of continued stress will cause or would cause greater uncertainty, and our complete economic recovery will largely depend on how long it takes the country and its citizens to emerge from their homes and get back to work and their lives. Even when that occurs, there will be a new normal, which no one can yet predict, but it is certain that consumer behaviors will change, which will benefit some industries but harm others. Therefore, we expect an uneven recovery. One key factor and strength of Bank7 that must be remembered is our strategy of loaning into more of the blue- collar types of projects and segments, essentially a more needs-based segment."
29,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"You can especially see that by reviewing the stratification data within the hospitality and CRE segments. Experience has taught us that economic downturns typically hit the more leverage and higher-end segments especially hard. We also know that past recessions have revealed the strengthen in what we call the cycle-down segments of the economy. We are very confident of our loan book. Being mindful of the heightened scrutiny surrounding credit quality, we have provided enhanced reporting to our energy, hospitality and CRE segments. Our enhanced reporting was provided with a view towards maintaining customer privacy as well as being aware that competitors also review materials."
30,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So with that being said, let's ask Jason Estes, our Chief Credit Officer, to walk us through the credit book."
31,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Jason E. Estes,Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Tom. With all due respect to the pandemic and the challenges in the world, we had a really strong first quarter in our loan book. Our credit metrics were in line with recent results. We had minimal past due loans, no charge-offs and a reduction in our NPAs. We also had a nice shift in our loan mix as we continued to decrease the energy portion of the portfolio, which now stands at 12% versus 18% of balances a year ago, and this trend is expected to continue. The largest increase was to our C&I book, as we successfully added several clients -- several large clients. Now as the month of March progressed, our markets began to be impacted by the pandemic. Being in the middle of the country, it was a little slower than on the coast. Our first loan modification related to the pandemic was done on March 15. And at the end of the quarter, we only had 25 loans that had been modified. I'd like to dive in a little bit to Slides 11 and 12 in the slide deck related to our hospitality portfolio."
32,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Jason E. Estes,Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We all know this space was impacted quickly by the pandemic. But long term, we remain confident in our customer base about a month ago was that occupancy had dropped all the way down to 5% to 10% in many cases. More recent reports are that they are already experiencing improved occupancy levels with the majority of properties, 2/3 of ours reporting that occupancy rates are already above 30%. 10 of our 34 operating properties report that the last 10 days, they've operated above 50% occupancy. Now full recovery for this industry is expected to take 2 to 3 years. On average, our operators need about 50% occupancy in order to amortize their debt. We believe the recovery to 50% occupancy will take much less than 2 to 3 years. As Tom stated, we remain committed and confident in this segment and our loan portfolio overall."
33,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Jason E. Estes,Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Now shifting to the energy industry. We have continued to reduce our energy exposure and are well positioned to handle any losses that may materialize from this sector as we presented on Slide 13. Bank7 has been actively reducing our energy lending activity for over a year because the industry was already dealing with a price and supply-driven slowdown. Now the pandemic has destroyed demand and the industry devastation is being well documented. The energy recovery will be slower, and it appears that there will be a lasting impact on companies and the industry overall."
34,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,Jason E. Estes,Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Consistent with prior quarters, we continue to experience migration within the service industry portfolio. Our borrowers in the service segment, now they've been through many cycles, but this one appears to be more severe, at least going into it. Within our portfolio, the E&P and midstream segments continue to perform at a high level in spite of current pricing conditions. I would also like to add briefly on our commercial real estate portfolio. Our construction portfolio concentration has been at multiyear lows over the past couple of quarters. We continue to focus on low-to-moderate priced homes and also expect to see a reduction in our hotel construction activity as projects are delayed while the economy recovers. Our exposure to retail land and lots is minimal and will continue to be that way."
35,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,35,Jason E. Estes,Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"And with that, I'd like to hand it back over to Tom."
36,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,36,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Jason. It's a good report on the credit side of the bank. So as we move forward, consumer sentiment is going to be the key to the recovery. People are simply not going to venture out unless they feel safe. This recovery will be different for that reason. Over the past decades, the gradual conversion of our economy into a service-based consumer-driven economy is highlighting how critical consumer sentiment will be to the recovery. It also happens to be why modeling is more difficult as older metrics just are not as reliable. A good reminder of that is that manufacturing now only accounts for approximately 11% of our GDP compared to 70% of GDP from consumer spending. Our focus will continue to be on our fundamentals. We'll continue to produce pretax, pre-provision earnings to create that strong foundation."
37,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,37,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our branch-light model has held up very well in the social distancing environment. It was not a big adjustment for our customers and staff. We're not saying it's business as usual, but we were able to easily adapt. We've always been very close to our customers. We have been very proactive talking to them, making sure they know we're here for them. Our strength of deep customer relationships and interaction has been obvious to us and to them, and we'll continue to do so."
38,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,38,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We also know that government stimulus programs and flexibility on future tax rates and measures will contribute to help us emerge and more quickly recover, and we'll stay abreast of all those items. We also will pay extra attention to our digital platform. System uptime has been good and generally speaking has withstood unparalleled traffic spikes. We will evaluate redundancies and system reliability metrics as we know that many people are now accessing the digital offerings and stressing our platforms."
39,"Bank7 Corp., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,39,Thomas L. Travis,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So as we wrap up, we would also like to say that we're seeing green shoots begin to emerge. There are flows of capital seeking opportunities. We intend to be vigilant, but also pay close attention to smart opportunities. In fact, we have a few opportunities right now that are very strong and very safe. In these times, being nimble yet prudent with additional long-term customer opportunities, especially with companies that have worked with large banks and experienced lackluster responses related to the PPP could use if we haven't yet is a new main street lending program, but we'll evaluate as they go forward. So wrapping up, we thank you for your time, and we'll open it up with any questions you might have."
