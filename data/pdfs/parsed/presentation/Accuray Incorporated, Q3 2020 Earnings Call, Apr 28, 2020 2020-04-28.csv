I also want to thank Suzanne Winter, our Chief Commercial Officer and Head of R&D; and Mike Hoge, our Senior Vice President of Global Operations specific areas of responsibility as we mobilize our efforts and resources across the company to address COVID-19, I thought it would be helpful to have both of them available to answer potential questions that are related to critical information in their respective areas."
8,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,8,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Clearly, because COVID-19 is at the forefront of everyone's mind, my prepared remarks this afternoon will focus on 3 primary topics: first, the impact that the pandemic is having on our customers' clinical practices and workflow; second, what we are doing to support them while keeping our employees safe; and lastly, our key areas of focus related to business continuity, both operational and financial."
9,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,9,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Although fighting the coronavirus has taxed the health care industry worldwide, the reality is that radiotherapy treatments are continuing around the world, and although based on direct feedback from customers, treatment delivery is being managed with modified clinical practice protocols and workflow. For example, lower risk and nonurgent cases and treatment starts are being pushed out and scheduled treatment times have been extended to allow for disinfection of treatment bunkers and equipment between patients. This has resulted in overall decreased patient treatment volumes."
10,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,10,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"There has also been an increase in the use of hypofractionation and ultra-hypofractionation to limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure for both patients and department staff, which we believe Accuray is uniquely positioned to support with our CyberKnife and Radixact Systems."
11,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,11,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"One of the other areas of paramount importance, given COVID-19 impacts to the overall hospital environment and radiotherapy department clinical practice protocols, is the health and safety of our frontline employees, almost 1/3 of our entire employee population, our global service team personnel, who are responsible for installation, preventative maintenance and break fix activities that support our installed base customers. During moments like these, our ability to provide service and clinical application support to ensure that our customers can continue treating patients safely and effectively is critical."
12,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,12,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'm incredibly inspired by these frontline heroes and their tireless dedication to supporting customers and patients, and I want to thank them publicly. Our service teams around the world are following customer and institution-specific defined safety protocols when they are on-site at customer locations, and we are helping to ensure their safety by providing personal protective equipment. I'm extremely proud of the collective efforts of the Accuray team involved in the day-to-day support of our customers."
13,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,13,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Despite all of these efforts, we should not underestimate the magnitude of the challenges that our customers currently face. As hospitals have been forced to focus the majority of their clinical resources in intensive and critical care medicine areas to support COVID-19 patients, many have been proactively pulling back from all clinical service lines and procedures deemed nonessential or elective in nature. For many hospitals, the resulting impact has been an extremely rapid loss of profitability and associated cash flows, and a growing number of facilities are finding themselves under significant financial stress."
14,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,14,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,The reprioritization of clinical resources and the associated customer challenges that have emerged along with restricted travel and/or facility access issues created delays in bunker modification projects and installations in our fiscal third quarter. We believe that these factors suggest that we should expect longer revenue conversion time lines in the near term.
15,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,15,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In terms of our internal business management focus, we've been taking actions across an array of both operational and financial areas to help ensure the continuity of our business. On the operational side, we've been working aggressively with our critical supply chain and logistics partners to help ensure that we have adequate supply to support both our production and service activities globally while maintaining maximum flexibility related to flexing up or down in terms of product build schedule changes."
16,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,16,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the financial side of our business continuity efforts, we are focused on cash flow management, and we are taking aggressive actions designed to preserve cash and maximize liquidity through operating expense reductions without compromising commercial activities and future innovation. These actions include, but are not limited to, reducing manufacturing raw materials purchases, aggressive account payables management, reducing CapEx spending, freezing all discretionary hiring activity and reductions all potential options that can contribute to cash preservation."
17,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,17,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, Accuray's executive team, consisting of my 7 direct reports and myself, have agreed to take a temporary reduction to our base salaries and waived any discretionary annual bonus payment that might otherwise have been paid out in the fiscal '20 year. We believe the actions that we have taken will help Accuray effectively navigate through the course of this pandemic."
18,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,18,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Despite the challenging environment caused by COVID-19 from an operational standpoint, Accuray had a reasonably solid third fiscal quarter. Gross orders for the quarter increased 27% to $106 million compared to $84 million in the prior year third quarter. On the revenue side, we reported Q3 revenue of $99.5 million, which was below our expectations, as we saw a timing impact due to COVID-19 deeper into the month of March when travel restrictions and lockdowns in certain markets went into effect, which as mentioned before, affected logistics and bunker construction schedules at both our distributor and end user levels."
19,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,19,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Although our revenue conversion timing for systems and upgrades has been impacted by the pandemic, we expect our service contract revenue, which has an annualized recurring run rate in excess of $200 million to remain stable as our installed base customers continue to rely on Accuray equipment to treat patients."
20,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,20,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"From a product mix perspective, CyberKnife contributed approximately 40% of the total gross orders in Q3, while the TomoTherapy platform, led by Radixact, accounted for approximately 60% of the gross orders during the quarter."
21,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,21,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"From a regional order performance perspective, the Americas region delivered its third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year order growth. Our focus on improving the consistency of commercial execution in the AMS region has been a work in progress. And we are very pleased with the continued momentum our Americas commercial team has made in growing our sales pipeline throughout that region."
22,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,22,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Gross orders in EMEA grew 16% on a year-over-year basis. In Japan, Q3 gross orders actually declined year-over-year, but based on overachievement in the first half of the fiscal year, the region is still ahead of our internal expectations on a year-to-date basis."
23,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,23,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Transitioning to China, gross orders from China remained strong with 11 new orders received during the quarter, 6 of which were Type A and 5 of which were Type B. Roughly 70% of these orders came through our joint venture subdealer network and the remaining 30% came through our legacy distributor, TomoKnife. We are still waiting for completion of the tender process for the first batch of 50 China Type A licenses awarded for our systems in October of 2019 and now believe that the beginning of revenue conversion will most likely begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2021."
24,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,24,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"You might also be aware that we've been expanding the depth of our management team with the recent additions of highly experienced executives, including Suzanne Winter, our Chief Commercial Officer, who joined us from Medtronic; and Mike Hoge, Senior Vice President of Global Operations and Supply Chain, who joined us from GE Healthcare. The extensive experience and the success that these executives have achieved at their previous companies provide Accuray with impressive bench strength as we navigate through this challenging operating environment."
25,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,25,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And lastly, an update regarding financial guidance. Given the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic and the significant economic uncertainty it introduces, we have made the decision to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. Once we believe that we have sufficient visibility to reinstate guidance, we will do so."
26,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,26,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In closing, while the current market conditions limit our near-term visibility, we are aggressively focused on those activities and actions that we can control, ensuring the health and safety of our employees, ensuring continued support for our customers and their patients and focusing on those elements, both operationally and financially, that will drive Accuray's business continuity."
27,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,27,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With that, let me turn the call over to Shig for his review of the financial details. Shig?"
28,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,28,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with some additional details on our order performance for the third quarter and then focus on certain highlights for the period."
29,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,29,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Gross orders for the third quarter were $106 million, which was up 27% from the prior year. On a year-to- date basis, gross orders increased approximately 15% over the same period prior year. Net age-outs for the quarter were $20 million, which was in line with our prior expectation. We did have approximately $4 million of aging activities during the quarter."
30,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,30,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"During the third quarter, we had cancellations and other adjustments of approximately $9 million. As a result, on a net basis, we generated $77 million of orders in the third quarter, which represented a 20% increase over the prior year."
31,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,31,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We ended our quarter with a backlog of $570 million, representing an increase of 15% from March 31, 2019. As Josh discussed earlier, we anticipate that COVID-19 disruption will adversely impact the pace of backlog to revenue conversion in the near term. Although the depth and the extent to which COVID-19 will impact individual markets could vary based on a number of factors, we could see higher-than-normal level of age-outs in the coming quarters due to this disruption."
32,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,32,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As for the China orders already aged out, we continue to believe that a meaningful number of them will eventually convert to revenue. The 50 Type A licenses already awarded for Accuray systems included several systems that were previously aged out."
33,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,33,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning now to our income statement. Total revenue for the third quarter was $99.5 million, down from $103.2 million in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down 4% from the prior year. Our product revenue of $45.5 million during the quarter declined 2% compared to prior year. Service revenue in the third quarter was $54 million, down 5% from the prior year. The decline in service revenue was primarily due to lower upgrades purchased through our service contracts."
34,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,34,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"From a product mix perspective, CyberKnife accounted for approximately 20% of the quarter's revenue unit volume, while the TomoTherapy platform accounted for the remaining 80%, most of which was driven by Radixact."
35,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,35,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning now to gross margin. Our product gross margin was 39.4% compared to 41.5% in the prior year. Service gross margin in the quarter was 39.2% compared to 37.3% in the prior year. Service margin for the quarter included an impact of fiscal 2020 bonus accrual reversal, which as Josh described earlier, related to waiver of executed bonus payout as well as adjustments to general employee bonus pool to reflect the current business environment."
36,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,36,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Excluding the impact of this bonus accrual adjustment, our service gross margin for the quarter was 37%, which was in line with our historical norm. Overall gross margin for the third quarter was 39.3% compared to 39.2% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the bonus accrual adjustment I just described, our overall gross margin for the quarter was 38%."
37,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,37,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving down the income statement. Operating expenses for the quarter were $31.2 million, a decrease of $6.4 million or 17% from the prior year. The year-over-year decline in our operating expenses was primarily driven by the bonus accrual reversal of approximately $4.5 million. The remaining decrease was driven by reductions in discretionary spend such as travel, given that certain-employee activities were restricted by COVID-19."
38,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,38,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"GAAP operating income for the quarter was $8 million compared to $2.9 million in the prior year.

39,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,39,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We began reporting our operating impact of the China JV in the third quarter, and it was an income of $0.2 million. This item is being reported on our income statement as a single line item called gain on equity investment. While we reported a small income from the China JV this quarter, we expect to see a small loss in the next few quarters as the JV continues to ramp on its operational and commercial startup activities."
40,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,40,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.3 million compared to $6.7 million in the prior year.

41,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,41,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Now a word about our balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with $92 million of cash and short-term restricted cash. We carried approximately $200 million of debt in aggregate at the end of the quarter, which consisted of $85 million convertible notes due July 2022 as well as a term loan of $85 million and an asset-backed revolver of $30 million from one lender, both of which mature in 2024. In summary, none of our outstanding debt today is scheduled to mature in the next 2 years."
42,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,42,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"From a working capital liquidity perspective, in addition to the asset-backed revolver facility, we maintained access to accounts receivable factoring facilities of over $20 million in Japan. Beyond access to these credit facilities, as Josh mentioned earlier, we are taking focused cash and control actions to preserve our liquidity position."
43,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,43,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In addition, our supply chain team is working very closely with our suppliers to adjust our inventory position to appropriate level as we closely monitor business conditions in the current environment."
44,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",Presentation,44,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And with that, I'd like to hand the call back to Josh."
