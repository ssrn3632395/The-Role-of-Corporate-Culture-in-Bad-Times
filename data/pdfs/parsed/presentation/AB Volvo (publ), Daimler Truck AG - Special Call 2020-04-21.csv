And also from my side a warm welcome to all of you. And I'm, of course, glad that you found the time to join us, and I hope that all of you on this call are staying safe and healthy in these challenging times. Our everyday lives have been very difficult and different during the past weeks, impacted by the COVID-19 virus outbreak. And of course, that goes very much for our businesses as well term strategic objectives of our industry and for society. And the number one issue still being climate change and reducing humanity's carbon footprint. We need to drive sustainable transportation to the next level."
6,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,6,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Today's announcement is proof of our determination to contribute to this goal. We know that transport and logistics is a key enabler for societies to grow and prosper. And we know that the need for transport will increase with a growing world population and also urbanization. We must meet that need with solutions that are more sustainable than today's. Electrification of road transport is a key element in delivering the so-called Green Deal, a carbon-neutral Europe and ultimately a carbon-neutral world. Using hydrogen as a carrier of green electricity to power electric trucks in long-haul operations and also for other applications like buses, construction equipment and the industrial segment is an important part of the puzzle and a complement to battery electric vehicles and renewable fuels."
7,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,7,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Decarbonizing our industry is a massive undertaking, and no company will be able to do everything on their own.

9,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,9,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"It is important, however, to be clear about a few things. First, the joint venture still needs to be approved by the appropriate authorities. And second, while we plan to partner in fuel cell technology, we will, of course, remain competitors in all other areas."
10,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,10,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Having said that, we share the same vision of a transformation towards sustainable transport solutions. And by working together in this specific area we will be able to progress faster. That is good for both our customers, but even more importantly for society as a whole."

13,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,13,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"I've been in this business for 30 years, and I can honestly say that announcing this partnership is one of the highlights of my career. I dare to call it a historic day for trucking. And let explain me why, 3 things. First of all, with Volvo and Daimler, 2 long time, established, distinguished truck makers are joining forces in a crucial fuel cell technology. Together, we can progress so much faster. We want to move the fuel cell technology into high-volume production in the second half of 2020. And we want to do so with the quality, reliability and durability that our commercial vehicle customers expect from all of our products and technologies. In doing so we aim to create acceptance for and trust in fuel cell technology in our society because that trust and engagement from other actors will be key in order for the vision of sustainable transportation to become reality."
14,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,14,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Second, we are not starting from scratch today at all. We rather build upon a reliable, available and mature foundation. Because at Daimler, we have a long history of research, development and production of this technology with millions of kilometers already driven in passenger car and commercial vehicle applications, trucks and buses are literally the perfect carriers to put this technology now into serious production vehicles."
15,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,15,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"And third, apart from increasing our speed to market, this joint venture also helps both of us to shoulder the substantial investment we will have to make in the coming years. Teaming up will create scale effects as well as other efficiencies, which are indispensable for the fuel cell to become commercially viable within our ambitious time frame."
16,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,16,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Regarding the current economic downturn, this aspect of our cooperation becomes even more important."
17,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,17,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"As you can see, these are all good reasons for both Daimler and Volvo to work together in this area, even though we are and we will remain natural competitors in all other aspects."
18,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,18,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"In addition to the announcement about our planned joint venture, I'd like to inform you on the organizational setup we are installing this in Daimler to make all of this happen. We will bundle all of our Daimler-wide fuel cell competency and capacities within Daimler trucks. To that end, we will establish a new entity called Daimler Trucks fuel cell. As Martin Lundstedt lined out, the fuel cell will be key to reach our target of CO2-neutral transportation. We need this technology in addition to battery electric vehicles."
19,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,19,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Due to the strategic relevance for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Daimler Trucks will be taking the leading role within Daimler AG for this technology. In our new unit Daimler Truck fuel cell, we will include teams of Mercedes-Benz fuel cell in Nabern, Mercedes-Benz Canada fuel cell and members of today's passenger car Mercedes-Benz AG."
20,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,20,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Over the past years, these colleagues have gained vast knowledge on the development and production of fuel cell systems for various vehicle applications. We are happy to bring these assets into the joint venture. Daimler has invested heavily in the past in this technology, and Daimler Trucks like Volvo will continue to invest heavily as we develop and manufacture serious production fuel cells."
21,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,21,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me sum it up. Making fuel cell technology work is no small undertaking for any one company. Thus, we are convinced that combining the experience of both Daimler and Volvo is the right thing to do for us, our customers and for society as a whole. We are very much looking forward, and I am very much looking forward to work together with Martin Lundstedt and his team."
22,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,22,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,The signing of today's agreement is also a call for action to others. We made our move to show our commitment to this technology. Now it's up to others to join us.
23,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",Presentation,23,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"In order to make CO2-neutral vehicles competitive, we need regulatory and governmental steering measures to improve the business case for our customers, including the crucial infrastructure for generating, storing and distributing hydrogen. We will not be able to accomplish this task alone, but today, we have very strongly and jointly made the first bold move to get us going. Having said that, I think we're all ready to take your questions. Thank you."
