This is a new experience conducting our AGM. In fact, my very first time conducting anything like that remotely. But sadly to say, I think since mid-March, we have all born witness to how this insidious virus has impacted our very way of life, our families and our communities. But at 01, I'm very pleased to report to you that with our remote access technologies, we have adopted to 100% remote working environment for many years. So this slowdown or lockdown of the city really carries no impact on the productivity of 01. We are charging ahead, full steam."

Thereafter, my presentation is going to open to public at around 4:30, whereby I'm going to present about the IronCAP product, the revenue model, the market size, et cetera, et cetera, and most importantly, the launching of the IronCAP X product, which is the world's very first quantum safe, end-to-end e-mail encryption product."
49,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,49,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now this is a snapshot of what we have achieved in 2019. First of all, after years of intensive research and development, we have filed our international patent application in December of 2018. And in April of 2019, which was our last AGM, we have announced the development plan of IronCAP X product, which is what we are launching today. And in August of 2019, the IronCAP engine became commercially available. And since then, things moved quicker. In the September of 2019, we have won the CIOReview Editors Choice award. And then shortly after that, in October of 2019, we have obtained an industry expert endorsement from Professor [ Percy Shetty ] at the University of Florida. And then November of 2019, we have conducted an aggressive hackathon. Whereby we offer $100,000 cash to whoever that managed to crack IronCAP encryption. With over 500 contestants over 36 days, they all failed. We announced the result in December. And then February of 2020, we have conducted a quantum workshop at the CCTX Conference in Toronto. Shortly after that, about a month ago, we have announced a technology licensing agreement with Hitachi in Japan. Only a few weeks ago, we have announced another memorandum of understanding with a global cybersecurity firm called Nexusguard. And now today, we are launching the IronCAP X product. Most importantly, we achieved all these using just $650,000 cash."
50,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,Presentation,50,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The most important thing about venture stage of any company will be cash burn. Our cash requirement moving from here will be about $700,000 to $800,000 per year. With the help of Richardson GMP, we're contemplating a nonbroker equity financing of up to $1 million. Together with our $0.25 million, we believe there is enough resources to carry the operation to cash flow positive with minimum dilution to shareholders. You may ask me exactly how I plan to do that. I'll tell you in a moment when I come back with the presentation on the IronCAP, IronCAP X and the demonstration. So I'm going to take a pause from here and come back to tell you everything. Well, we have a few minutes before public presentation on our product. So I guess I can take a few questions to answer. If you have a question, please use the Q&A feature and type your name and question. I'll read out your name and I'll read out your question before I answer it."
