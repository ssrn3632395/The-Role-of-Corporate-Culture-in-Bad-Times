7,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you and good morning. Earlier today, we announced first quarter revenue of $8.7 million, which is an increase of 2.8% over the first quarter last year. We also reported GAAP net income of $0.14 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $0.18 per diluted share. These results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and similar to the current discussion being had across much of the of 2020."
8,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Regarding our ability to sell our products in the current environment, much of the sales cycle for products recognized in revenue during the first quarter was completed in the fourth quarter 2019. Additionally, as we progress through the first quarter 2020 and the impact of COVID-19 continue to spread throughout the world, we experienced an acceleration in the decline of orders for our products as our customers focus their efforts on preparing for and treating those infected with the virus and deferring decisions to purchase our products into the future. Also during this time, many of our hospital customers began restricting access to health care workers only, diminishing our ability to generate sales, which may delay the timing of future orders."
9,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We may be further impacted if hospitals choose to maintain their restrictions on hospital entrants and limit their capital spending plans until their operations have stabilized. So despite the significant uncertainties created by COVID-19, we believe that this is a shorter-term dynamic and that higher demand for our products will return."
10,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"During the quarter, there were several bright spots for us to focus on. The first is revenue from our international channels exceeded our initial forecast, and total international revenue grew almost 73% over the first quarter last year."
11,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Second, we received COVID-related orders for our IV pumps for some customers because of its remote control capabilities and its use as the primary infusing device in an isolation room configuration. We're really proud to be able to contribute to the overall treatment efforts for this virus."
12,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And third, revenue from sales of our IV sets also exceeded our initial forecast in part due to COVID-related demand. During the quarter, we learned that some customers were using one version of our IV tubing set to infuse patients located in an isolation room utilizing a pump that is positioned outside that room."
13,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With the current shortages of critical care supplies, IRadimed wanted to do more to help health care providers combat the increased demands that COVID-19 has placed on them. So we are using our clean room and IV set manufacturing expertise to build standard extension tubing that can be substituted for any IV extension tubing our customers are having trouble finding. It is just a simple IV tube using the same quality materials and components we use in our regular tubing. And we expect sales of this new tubing to begin within the next few days."
14,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"During Q1, we filled key leadership roles in sales, regulatory affairs and quality assurance and R&D as part of succession planning and to continue building out our capabilities that will help support the growth we anticipate in the years ahead. We also continue making progress on our product road map and have not seen any significant changes to time lines at this point."
15,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"However, I will point out that there are steps in the new product testing phase that require the use of third parties. And given the stay-at-home restrictions implemented by many government authorities, there may be shifts to our original testing schedules."
16,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now from a supply chain standpoint, we are not experiencing any delays in obtaining the materials for our products at this time. Overall, we are experiencing significant changes to our business due to COVID. During this time, we are focusing on the things that we can control and continuing to make investments in the company that are supportive of its longer-term health with the goal of emerging from the pandemic even stronger."
17,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In our efforts to manage through this environment, we are looking through 4 lenses. The first one is product innovation for future growth. As mentioned, we have recently filled key technical leadership roles and continue to make progress on our product road map."
18,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The second one is serving our customers, whether through modifying a version of our IV tubing to facilitate infusions from outside an isolation room or supplying our IV pumps for its remote control capabilities or providing virtual product training. We stand ready to support our customers' delivery of critical care for COVID-19 patients."
19,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,The third lens is taking care of our employees. We have a highly trained workforce and have implemented several policies that support their health and well-being during this time. These range from enhanced cleaning procedures at our headquarters facility to remote working arrangements where feasible.
20,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The fourth is cost containment. We've already taken several steps to contain costs, including implementing reduced hours in some departments and complying with travel and entry restrictions by our field sales and clinical support teams. We will continue to look through these 4 lenses as the situation develops, and we'll evaluate taking additional steps, if needed."
21,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Now I'll turn it over to Chris to summarize the financial results.
22,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you and good morning. As always, I'll be discussing our financial results on a GAAP basis as well as on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP operating results exclude stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effects. Infrequent tax items are considered based on their nature and excluded from our provision for income taxes as these items are not indicative of our normal provision for income taxes. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations less cash used for purchases of property and equipment."
23,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, along with our GAAP financial statements, can be helpful in providing a more thorough analysis of our ongoing financial performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure on the last page of today's press release."
24,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"As we reported this morning, first quarter 2020 revenue increased 2.8% over the first quarter last year. Revenue from domestic sales decreased 10.6% to $6.3 million during the current quarter, while revenue from international sales increased 72.7% to $2.4 million for the current quarter. The decrease in domestic sales was primarily driven by lower pump sales, and the increase in international sales was driven by higher pump and monitor sales."
25,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Revenue from sales of our devices decreased 6.8% to $5.6 million for the first quarter 2020. This decrease was driven by a 36.4% decline in IV pump revenue that was partially offset by a 63.5% increase in revenue from our monitoring systems. The average selling price of our MRI-compatible IV infusion pump system during the first quarter of 2020 was approximately $29,900 compared to approximately $35,800 for the same period in 2019."
26,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"The decrease in ASP relates to higher international sales of our infusion pumps recognized in revenue when compared to the first quarter last year. The average selling price of our MRI-compatible patient vital signs monitoring system during the first quarter 2020 was approximately $35,400 compared to approximately $37,400 for the same period in 2019. The decrease in ASP relates to higher international sales of our monitoring system recognized in revenue when compared to the first quarter last year."
27,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Revenue from sales of our disposables, services and others increased by 30.7% to $2.7 million for the first quarter 2020 from $2 million for the same quarter in 2019. And lastly, revenue from the amortization of extended maintenance contracts increased 4.5% to $0.5 million for the current quarter."
28,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Gross margin was 74.5% for the 2020 quarter and 75.7% for the 2019 quarter. The decrease in gross margin is a result of higher international sales as a percent of total revenue, partially offset by unfavorable inventory costing adjustments recognized during the first quarter last year."
29,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Operating expenses were $5.7 million or 66% of revenue compared to $4.9 million or 57.8% of revenue for the first quarter last year. On a dollar basis, operating expenses increased due to higher expenses for payroll, benefits and stock compensation due to higher headcount, higher employee recruiting costs and higher legal and professional fees, partially offset by lower sales commissions."
30,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Our effective tax rate for the 2020 quarter was negative 111.7% compared to negative 14.9% for the 2019 quarter. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to discrete items related to stock compensation us to carry back our net operating loss to years prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which increased the benefit to the previously enacted federal tax rate of 35% versus the current federal tax rate of 21%."
31,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Net income on a GAAP basis was $0.14 per diluted share for the first quarter 2020 compared to $0.15 for the 2019 quarter.

32,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1.2 million of cash from operations compared to $700,000 for the 2019 quarter. For the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, cash provided by operations was provided -- was positively impacted by cash inflows from accounts receivable and deferred revenue and negatively impacted by prepaid income taxes, inventory and accrued payroll and benefits."
33,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"For the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, and 2019, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $1 million and $600,000, respectively. And lastly, we exited the quarter with a combined cash and investments balance of $47.4 million and no third-party debt or other restrictive covenants. And with that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator?"
