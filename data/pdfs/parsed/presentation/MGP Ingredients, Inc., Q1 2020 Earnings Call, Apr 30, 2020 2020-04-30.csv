3,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,3,Mike Houston,,EXECUTIVES,"At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to MGP's Chief Executive Officer, Gus Griffin. Gus?"
4,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,4,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Mike. And thank you all for joining us. At the conclusion of our call in February, none of us could have imagined how our world was going to change in just a few short months. On the call this morning, we will provide details of our performance for the first quarter as usual, but we also spend some time in our comments discussing items, which believe will be of interest to you in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."
5,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,5,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Before we turn to the results for this quarter, I'd like to welcome Dave Colo to the call this morning, as our recently appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. Following my retirement in May, Dave will assume the role of CEO. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to lead such a talented, passionate, and collaborative organization. I also appreciate the strong ongoing support of our Board. I've worked closely with Dave since he joined the Board in 2015, and I am confident he will be a terrific successor in leading MGP. As a Director on our Board, Dave played a critical role in supporting the company's growth over the past several years, and we are very excited to have him on the executive leadership team."
6,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,6,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Now, I will turn to the results for the first quarter. We are very pleased with the results this quarter, with consolidated sales increasing 11.2% and gross profit increasing 39.3%. These results reflect strong customer demand in both business segments, and improved effectiveness in our tactical execution. Our results for this quarter reflect growth in premium beverage brown goods sales, as well as significant year- over-year increases in sales of our specialty wheat starches and proteins."
7,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Looking at each segment individually, in our distillery products segment, sales finished the quarter up 7.3% to $80 million, while gross profit increased to $18.2 million or 22.8% of segment sales. These results reflect a 240 basis point increase in gross profit margin, as compared to the prior year period. Sales of premium beverage alcohol were up 9.4% for the quarter. These improved results were primarily driven by a double-digit growth in both sales of new distillate and aged whisky, which led to a 17.1% increase in sales of brown goods. We saw strong demand for our inventory of aged whiskey, including sales of whiskey from our 2015 and 2016 vintages. Sales of aged whiskey reflect lower pricing versus the prior year quarter, but in line with our expectations. Despite some significant changing dynamics at the retail level and potential challenges to specific customers, we believe the underlying macro consumer trends supporting the ongoing growth of the American whiskey category remains strong."
8,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The stay-at-home orders have had a devastating impact on on-premise sales over the past six weeks, while consumers appear to be increasing their consumption at home, driving record increases in off- premise sales during the period. While channel specific trends going forward are uncertain, the category trends seem to be holding strong, with American whiskey continuing to be one of the top growth categories. While sales of premium beverage white goods were down 1.6% for the quarter, margins improved due to lower input cost."
9,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"While continuing to implement our broader growth plan, we are also focusing on helping our industrial alcohol customers navigate the challenges they are confronted with as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to continuing the legacy our company was founded on more than 75 years ago by supporting the relief effort with both financial aid and increased production of alcohol for hand sanitizer and commercial disinfectant needs. MGP is uniquely positioned to serve as the backbone of the increased industrial alcohol production in this country, and we're proud to expand our efforts at our Kansas and Indiana facilities during this critical time."
10,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Sales of industrial alcohol increased for the quarter by 5.7%. As a reminder to those new to the story, we typically run our alcohol production close to full capacity to optimize the cost structure of our facilities. While we have experienced increased demand related to COVID-19 over the past several weeks, it's important to point out that a significant portion of our industrial alcohol and premium beverage white goods production was already contracted for a set price last fall. Improved demand for industrial alcohol has come into play in the near term, but we do not view this pandemic as an opportunity to maximize short-term financial results on this product line."
11,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Also of note, sales of dried distillers grains, or DDG, experienced a decline of 1.5%, as compared to the first quarter of 2019. This was due to a slight decrease in sales volume, partially offset by favorable average selling prices. Revenue from warehouse services increased by 10.5%, reflecting, in part, the growth in the number of customer barrels aging in our whiskey warehouses and other services we provide."
12,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to ingredient Solutions. Sales grew 31.4% to $19.1 million. Gross profit increased to $5 million or 26% of segment sales, reflecting a significant increase in gross profit margin, as compared to the prior year period. Our Ingredient Solutions posted its fourteenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year business over the past several years, and we are encouraged by the robust gross margins we were able to achieve this quarter. The majority of this increase is due to our ability to optimize sales in production toward our highest margin products. We also benefited from decreased input cost in the absence of flood- related cost."
13,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Specialty wheat starch sales grew 48.4% this quarter, while our specialty wheat protein sales grew 43.3%, both driven by increased volume and favorable average selling prices. We believe our specialty starch portfolio, particularly our line of fiber products and our recently rebranded ProTerra line of textured proteins, continue to be aligned with strong consumer trends."
14,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a period of uncertainty and potential challenges, we remain committed to taking the measures necessary to help ensure the safety and well being of our employees. We began our response to the pandemic by mobilizing a Central Crisis Response Team, which has been up and running since mid-March. This broad-ranging team includes members from operations, HR, legal, IT, finance, and our executive team, which meet on a weekly basis. We also created a specialized subgroup of this team, which meets daily. This subgroup was established to manage proactive and responsive actions across our operations. We have direct engagement with all areas of the organization on a daily basis, and have enacted centralized protocols for responding to operational issues as they develop."
15,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We're proud of the aggressive actions put in place to safeguard our employees while they perform their essential work. We continue to look to the CDC, WHO, and state and local health departments for guidance as we move forward at each of our facilities and offices."
16,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Augustus C. Griffin,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,This concludes my remarks. Let me now turn things over to Brandon Gall for a review of the key metrics and numbers. Brandon?
17,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Gus. For the quarter, consolidated sales increased 11.2% to $99.1 million, reflecting a 7.3% increase in the distillery products segment, and a 31.4% increase in the Ingredient Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit increased 39.3% to $23.2 million, due to increased gross profit in both the distillery products and Ingredient Solutions segments. Consolidated gross margin increased by 470 basis points to 23.4% of sales, up from 18.7% in the prior year quarter. Corporate selling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $9.5 million for the first quarter 2020, representing an increase of 16.6% compared to the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense, inclusive of certain incremental costs incurred relating to the transition at the CEO position. Consolidated operating income increased 61% to $13.7 million, due to increased gross profit in both the distillery products and Ingredient Solutions segments, partially offset by increased corporate selling, general, and administrative expenses."
18,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Non-GAAP operating income increased 67.9% to $14.3 million, exclusive of CEO transition costs. Our corporate effective tax rate was 24.7% in the current quarter, compared to a tax benefit of 17.7% in the prior year quarter that resulted from a sizable vesting of share-based awards. Consolidated net income for the quarter increased slightly to $9.8 million, while earnings per share remained flat from the prior year period at $0.57 per share. EPS was affected by improved operating results and partially offset by a prior- year period tax benefit, resulting from the vested share-based awards."
19,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"MGP's balance sheet and access to capital remains strong. We remain well capitalized and threw down additional funds on our revolving credit facility during the quarter to maintain a conservative cash position and have sufficient liquidity in the event the pandemic directly impacted operations. As such, we ended the quarter with a debt balance of $96.1 million, and a cash balance of $42.7 million. As of March 31, 2020, approximately $245 million remain available under the $300 million revolving credit line. Our leverage continues to be very low, and given we haven't experienced any significant economic hardship on our business to date as a result COVID-19, we have not participated in any of the lending programs provided by the CARES Act."
20,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"First quarter 2020 cash flow provided by operations was $0.5 million, compared to a use of cash of approximately $3.8 million in the prior year quarter, an improvement of $4.3 million. Accounts receivable and days sales outstanding increased $11.5 million at seven and a half days during the quarter, respectively. This increase is consistent with the development of longer sales histories with craft customers, new relationships with export customers, and new long-term supply agreements with large customers, all of which we've discussed on this call in previous quarters."
21,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Customers we extend credit to are mostly large in nature, and all have a combination of strong balance sheets and long payment histories with MGP. As a result, we're not experiencing issues with collections. Historically, first quarter operating cash flow has not been indicative of the whole year. During the period, we also invested a net $7.2 million for growing our barrel distillate inventory for aging. As a reminder to those that might be new on the call today, while we did reduce our annual volume growth expectations for aged whiskey on our call last February, we believe our library of various mash bills and vintages will continue to contribute significant levels of profit for the company going forward. We also believe our inventory set aside for aged whiskey sales in the U.S. market is close to reaching equilibrium on a net basis, and any future inventory increase will be for export sales, new mash bills, and to support the growth of our own brands. Past or even recent quarters are not necessarily indicative of barrel distillate investment in subsequent quarters."
22,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Fluctuations in our quarterly investment can be impacted by a number of factors, including customer demand for new distillate, production efficiencies, mixing capacity, warehouse capacity, and sales of aged whiskey. Our warehouse expansion program has been another important initiative to support new distillate demand for our customers, as well as our investment in aging inventory. As of March 31, 2020, we spent approximately $49.7 million of $49.8 million we projected as a total investment. The program remains on track to be completed later this year."
23,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"During the quarter, we purchased shares in the open market as part of a $25 million common stock repurchase program announced in February of 2019. We repurchased 159,104 shares for approximately $4.1 million for a weighted average all-in cost per share of $25.47 during the first quarter of 2020, and we concluded our purchases on March 16. Recently, the Board authorized a second quarter dividend in the amount of $0.12 per share. The Board continues to view dividends as an important way to share the success of the company with shareholders."
24,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Brandon M. Gall,VP of Finance & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Let me now turn things over to Dave Colo for concluding remarks.
25,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Brandon. Now, I would like to touch on some additional initiatives that support our long-term strategic plan, but first, address our outlook for the balance of the year. While we are off to a strong start to the year with ample access to capital and encouraging customer demand, our financial results for the balance of the year could be impacted by the COVID-19 virus. Given the uncertainty this pandemic has caused for nearly every industry across the world, it is impossible to predict with any level of precision the pandemic's cumulative impact on our future financial results. For these reasons, we are withdrawing our previous 2020 guidance, and we'll reassess this position based on the visibility of the macroeconomic recovery."
26,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"Our balance sheet and access to capital continue to be strong, while we seek to optimize cash management during this pandemic. Although our long-term capital allocation strategy may experience little change, we seek to maintain a conservative cash position, as outlined by Brandon earlier. By renewing our credit facility and expanding our borrowing capacity earlier this year, we have enhanced our access to capital with attractive pricing and terms. As we navigate the effects of this pandemic, we will remain focused on prudent capital management, which is why we have elected to curtail stock repurchases while maintaining our quarterly dividend. The management team, in close collaboration with the board, has the ability to initiate the buyback program or adjust quarterly dividends as circumstances warrant. The American whiskey category continues to experience strong growth and we will continue to invest to support that growth. The demand and pricing in line with our expectations demonstrate the health of this and scale advantage and plan to increase our focus toward growing volume share in the global American whiskey category."
27,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"We do not believe this equates to significant changes to overall pricing, but rather refinements to how we approach the selling process, the products we offer and the markets we focus on. Our objective, going forward will be to optimize our brown goods profit by increasing volume share at market-based pricing. Although we believe the American whiskey category trends are long-term in nature, we have identified a handful of potential headwinds for the balance of the year as a result of the pandemic. While we did not experience any significant impact from these potential headwinds during the quarter, we wanted to proactively share what we're seeing across the industry."
28,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"The first relates to the potential pantry loading that may have been occurring over the past several weeks, causing off-premise sales to significantly spike. We are unsure how long these purchasing behaviors will continue and what potential impact they might have on future off-premise sales when stay-at-home orders are lifted across the nation. Second, the stay-at-home orders and closures of bars, restaurants and tasting rooms are having an immediate impact on our craf customer sales the past several weeks. We would anticipate these trends to reverse as these establishments reopen. But it is difficult to predict when that might occur in a meaningful way. The third potential headwind is related to our multinational customers. While most have strong balance sheets and access to capital, it is unclear how their conservation of cash may impact our brown goods sales throughout the balance of the year. The last potential headwind we have identified is our near-term ability to grow international sales and export our distilled spirits overseas."
29,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"In the first quarter, we began to experience meaningful progress against our ability to expand our international sales. We continue to believe that our investments to expand international sales will provide long-term shareholder value. However, as travel has been curtailed and tariffs in key international markets persist, our ability to further develop this opportunity has been delayed. We continue to closely monitor each of these potential headwinds and will provide additional updates as they become available. Our warehouse expansion project is substantially complete, allowing us to increase our storage capacity to meet the growing demand for our new distillate. We anticipate the conclusion of this project to occur in the second quarter."
30,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"As Brandon mentioned, we also invested an additional $7.2 million in our aging whiskey inventory. This brings our inventory of aging whiskey to $111.4 million at cost. The positive brown goods results this quarter continue to demonstrate the long-term value of our aged whiskey inventory. While our focus in the Distillery Products segment will always be supplying other brand owners with premium distilled spirits, we continue to progress our brands initiative with the acquisition of new Columbia distillers based in Washington D.C. We're thrilled to add the Greenhouse Gin brand to our award-winning portfolio This acquisition enhances the depth of expertise and commitment to the category we've developed over the years."
31,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"We continue to develop our existing markets focused on increasing retail distribution and velocity per point of distribution for our portfolio brands. Although the current environment is not generally conducive to M&A activity, we will continue to assess opportunities to strengthen our position in growing markets in concert with our financial position in the upcoming quarters."
32,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"Our pandemic response plan, which is designed to accommodate evolving information and guidance provided by government agencies and health officials, focuses on protecting our employees and customers and doing our part to help stop the spread of the virus. The Central Crisis Response Team and specialized subgroup Gus mentioned earlier have helped to ensure the safety of our employees as well as to comply with various government restrictions for stay-at-home orders. As directed by these two teams, we will continue to implement social distancing at each of our facilities and offices, paying hourly wage bonus to our production employees, cross-train team members to ensure coverage for critical positions, provide health screenings and monitoring for our employees as well as extending our sick leave policy, restrict travel across the organization, implement work-from-home policies where we are able and lastly, we will continue to have a weekly risk assessment of our supply chain, which includes a daily monitoring of our contractors, transport partners, input producers and all other suppliers and vendors to mitigate any potential disruptions to our supply chain."
33,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"Before we conclude our prepared remarks and begin the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would like to express my gratitude to Gus for his success in leading the company. Since joining in 2014, Gus was able to focus the entire organization on a clear strategy, led its successful implementation and, very importantly, helped restore MGP's special culture. We are well-positioned for the next chapter in our story and we sincerely thank Gus for his years of dedicated service to MGP and the lasting contributions he has made to the company. The aggressive implementation of our strategic plan, put in place by Gus over the past several years, has positioned MGP for sustainable long-term growth."
34,"MGP Ingredients, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,Dave Colo,,EXECUTIVES,"Management team will be focused on continually refining the effectiveness of our tactical execution, accelerating the pace of our strategic implementation and leveraging the strong foundation we have built for growth in 2020 and beyond. We remain confident that focusing on our key strategies will drive superior long-term shareholder value moving forward. Operator, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call."
