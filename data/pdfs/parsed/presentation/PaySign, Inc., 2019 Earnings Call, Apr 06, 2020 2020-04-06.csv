5,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,5,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Before I begin my commentary on the business, I would like to address the delay in the filing of our 10- K. The delay in our filing was due to several rounds of auditor request for additional data, which took numbers we reported on March 16. Mark can touch on this in more detail during his discussion."
6,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,6,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"I'm very pleased to be able to deliver strong results for the full-year performance, even with the miss related to our revenue guidance. For the full year, our revenues were a record $34.7 million, an increase of 48% compared to the prior year. Our full-year net income was up 188% or $7.5 million, also a record, and our adjusted EBITDA was 10.1%, an increase of 106%. I'm very happy with these results and extremely proud of our team and their contributions towards our continued growth."
7,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,7,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"We experienced strong growth in our existing industry verticals and as we expanded into new verticals. In 2019, we built out a new business line, added 49 new card programs, including 38 in plasma, 7 in pharma and 4 other card programs. And we now have in excess of 2.9 million cardholders on our platform."
8,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,8,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"I'm especially pleased with the revenue growth in our pharmaceutical programs, which increased from $366,000 to over $7.3 million in just 1 year. With new opportunities opening in the space, we have expanded beyond our long-standing pharmaceutical payment offerings and established the Patient Affordability business line to include other services required by our hub service clients. These new services include pharmacy based co-pay, medical claims processing and payments, centralized billing and payment services as well as other products. You'll be hearing the term hub from us quite often moving forward, as we grow this business line. So to define hubs, hub service providers are companies that pharmaceutical manufacturers use to maintain a connection with the patients during all phases of the prescription delivery process."
9,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,9,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Over the past few years, there has been a consolidation of hub service providers. The consolidation in the industry has turned allied companies into competitors, therefore, created an opportunity for us to provide these new offerings to hub service providers that lack or choose not to provide these services in-house. In response to this opportunity, we have made the decision to increase our capabilities to cater to these hub service providers with programs currently onboarded and performing to initial expectations. Over the course of the past year, we have continued to build out this business line and have onboarded new personnel to meet the needs of this unique market. This represented a substantial investment into new software development, architecture and human capital. Drawing from industry experience, we designed, developed and deployed a best-in-class solution to meet the needs of our patient affordability partners. These enhanced capabilities will further our reach into the patient affordability space and allow us to onboard new clients for multiple sectors."
10,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,10,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"We have continued to build out and strengthen our entire team here at PaySign. In the latter part of 2019, we also increased the bench strength of our executive team with the addition of Matt Lanford as our Chief Product Officer and Kim Sergent as our Chief Marketing Officer. They have been instrumental in creating new products, features and functionality for our clients as well as refreshing our brand. I'm very pleased to have them as part of our team."
11,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,11,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"I'd like to touch for a moment now on COVID-19 and would like to reiterate that our highest priority remains the safety of our employees, cardholders and customers. We have taken immediate actions to protect our people, customers and business by executing on our business continuity plans. To us, especially important is the main sectors we serve are crucial to the health and well-being of the general public. We have implemented measures to manage potential disruptions in meantime, real-time communications across entire organizations with our clients and cardholders. To date, there have been no work stoppages and no employees testing positive for COVID-19. Of course, we will continue to monitor this situation very closely."
12,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,12,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"The impact of COVID-19 to our business so far has been minimal, with no apparent effect on our pharma and Patient Affordability business lines, which continue to see excellent growth, and only a slight impact to our plasma business. However, we are expecting at this time to see a continued growth year-over- year in the plasma business. On March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released the guidance document that enumerated source plasma donation and pharmaceutical supply as part of the critical infrastructure. Plasma donation centers have been classified as being within the category of essential, critical infrastructure, health care and pharmaceutical supply that is exempted from general lockdown or closure directives."
13,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,13,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Looking forward to the other side of the pandemic, 2 things. First is that we expect the economic fallout from the pandemic will lead to an increase in the number of donors as donor compensation can bring an extra $500 a month to frequent donors. And secondly, if plasma collected from people with the COVID-19 antibody is found to be a component of any therapies that would treat the virus, we would expect to see a sizable increase in the number of plasma donations, both from the current donor demographic and the general public."
14,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,14,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Looking ahead, we will continue to broaden and diversify our market focus for our card programs, and we'll seek to introduce new products. We are developing new business-to-business solutions, enhancing our customer web and mobile applications and building new pharma patient affordability offerings. We expect continued growth in pharma and plasma and to continue to expand it to new markets."
15,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,15,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"With regards to PaySign Premier, we continued to refine the product that is offered through one of our plasma clients. To date, we have minimized our marketing expense for the Premier Card as we have chosen to deploy the majority of our focus and resources on the expansion of the previously mentioned initiatives."
16,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,16,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Lastly, we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in 2020. We have evaluated several candidates to date. However, there is nothing definitive to share at this time."
17,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,17,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Before I turn it over, I'd like to address the question of Dan Henry. As you all know, Mr. Henry has served as our Chairman and as an Independent Director since 2018. On March 25, it was announced that Mr. Henry was appointed Chief Executive Officer, President and as a Board Member at Green Dot Corporation. After a discussion with the PaySign Board and Mr. Henry, it was unanimously decided, there would be no change to Mr. Henry's status with the company. Mr. Henry remains with PaySign as our Chairman and as an Independent Director."
18,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,18,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"At this time, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Mark Attinger, who will take us through the numbers in more detail, and will touch briefly on SOX 404(b)."
19,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,19,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Mark. So I'm going to take us through the full year results, provide some variance commentary, touch on SOX 404(b) and give you some insights into quarter 1 performance. And digesting our earnings and the 10-K, I'm sure you've noticed we've disaggregated revenue a bit and enhanced our commentary. As I proceed, references to year-on-year improvements or percentage changes, unless stated otherwise, refers to the full year 2019 as compared to 2018."
20,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,20,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Revenue for the year ending December 31, 2019, was $34,666,653, an increase of 48.0% compared to the $23,423,675 the prior year. Revenue consisted of $27.0 million or 78% in support of the plasma industry, $7.4 million or 21% pharma and $0.3 million or 1% in other revenue. Although quarter 4 dollars loaded to card performed as expected, the revenue conversion rate on plasma of 3.42% was down from 3.80% in Q3. This unexpected degradation, combined with lighter pharma spend, contributed to the full year revenue shortfall versus guidance."
21,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,21,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Gross profit increased 68.8% to $19.3 million or 55.5% of revenues compared to $11.4 million and 48.7% of revenues in 2018. This 685 basis point improvement was driven primarily to favorable mix towards higher-margin card programs. The operating expenses were $13.1 million, an increase of 47.2% versus $8.9 million in 2018. The increase consisted primarily of $2.5 million in salaries and benefits, $1.1 million in stock-based compensation and a $0.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization."
22,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,22,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Benefiting from higher card balances, interest income was $441,000 compared to $140,000 the prior year. Net income for the year was $7,454,319 or $0.16 per basic share, an increase of 188.0% compared to $2,588,054 or $0.06 per basic share the prior year. Fully diluted was $0.14 per share compared to $0.05. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $10,114,980 or $0.21 per basic share, an increase of 106.2% compared to $4,904,781 or $0.11 per share at the prior year. Furthermore, the adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 29.2%, up 824 basis points from 20.9% in 2018."
23,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,23,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We loaded $859 million loaded to the card versus $621 million the prior year, and our revenue conversion rate of gross dollar volume loaded on cards was 4.04% or 404 basis points compared to 3.77% or 377 basis points the prior year. I'd also like to point out that our near final 2020 first quarter pharma net dollars loaded to card increased approximately 70% versus quarter 1 2019 and increased 275% versus the prior quarter loads. This illustrates both the seasonal nature of pharma business and the significant year-on-year growth."
24,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,24,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated cash, including restricted cash, has increased 43.9% or $13.9 million to $45.6 million compared to $31.7 million at year-end 2018. As a point of reference and a seasonal peak for our current programs, consolidated cash at February month end was $61.6 million. Also, although we haven't completed our reconciliation, we expect our quarter-ending consolidated cash to be approximately $54 million to $55 million, including unrestricted cash of approximately $9.5 million, consistent with year-end."
25,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,25,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Working capital increased to $13.6 million compared to $5.9 million at December 31, 2018. The $7.7 million improvement was due primarily to increased consolidated cash, partially offset by an increase in the card funding liability. Our liquidity, as measured by an adjusted current ratio, excluding restricted cash and cardholder funds from both sides of the balance sheet, respectively, reflected 7.9x coverage at year- end 2019, up from 5.4x at 2018."
26,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,26,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"I'd like to speak for a moment regarding Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b). At the end of quarter 2, our market cap resulted in being classified as an accelerated filer and subject to an independent audit of our internal controls of our financial reporting, i.e., the 404(b). The objective of Sarbanes-Oxley and the COSO framework is to make sure that your processes and controls help to prevent any inaccuracies in your financial reporting. So in preparation, we brought in a third-party advisory firm, as many companies do, to aid us in preparing for 404(b). Subsequently, PaySign and our auditors identified material weakness over internal controls for financial reporting. We take this very seriously and have taken immediate steps to remediate the identified weakness. We added staff to aid in the assessments. We implemented an appropriate separation of responsibilities. We improved our documentation and have strengthened the processes with respect to systems user access and change control. We will continue to make improvements during 2020. Please refer to Item 9A of the 10-K for more information."
27,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,27,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In the light of the identified control weaknesses, the auditors were extra diligent in their assessment of the financial audit, leading to an extended duration. This resulted in the completion of our third year with our current auditors. And once again, the audit opinion stated, ""The financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the company as of December 31, 2019"". And the opinion further states, ""Results of operation's cash flows were in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles"". Also, for those of you interested in looking more closely at quarter 4, our financial results, of course, do roll; therefore, full year less September year-to-date, does reflect our Q4 earnings and financial activity."
28,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,28,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As we look to 2020, we will refrain from issuing revenue guidance at this time to allow for a further evaluation of COVID-19 and any impact on our business. Pharma and plasma are both defensive in nature, as our CEO has stated, plasma has been deemed critical infrastructure. We do expect to benefit from continued revenue growth and also similar gross margins to 2019. We also expect to experience moderate OpEx growth as we continue to make select and sound investments in our sales, technologies and operations capabilities. Although we have not completed our month-end and quarter-end closing procedures, for the first quarter, we do anticipate revenue of approximately $10.4 million to $10.5 million, up 43% to 45% versus $7.3 million the prior year. I think that concludes my remarks at this time. I'm going to turn it back over to our moderator to begin a question-and-answer session. Thank you."
