I will start, again, since I was right close to the beginning. And as I was saying, our fiscal second quarter has been one of the most difficult we've seen in a long time given the environment around the world. However, our team at SMART has stepped up to the challenges and delivered strong operational and financial results with both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share above the midpoint of our guidance range in spite of some delays we experienced in component availability from China and from some customers' operations in China."
12,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,12,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"The emergence of the COVID-19 crisis has clearly created operational challenges and macroeconomics uncertainties.

13,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,13,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In the second fiscal quarter, our performance also benefited from a good macro environment for memory products and also from stability in Brazilian policies and the economy there. Furthermore, our acquisitions from fiscal 2019 are showing improved performance and increased potential with a robust pipeline of new business in place."
14,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,14,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Finally and importantly, the convertible debt refinancing that we completed in early February this year is accretive to earnings and significantly strengthens our balance sheet and cash position to be able to better weather the challenges ahead and also to take advantage of the opportunities that will be created in this changing environment."
15,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,15,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Today, we have our team around the world working from home or working in our manufacturing facilities, providing the essential services and products our customers need from us. While manufacturing operations continue in all of our facilities around the world so far, in some manufacturing locations, we are operating at reduced levels to keep within local guidelines and to maintain employee safety. Overall, we've been able to prioritize requirements with our customers and keep them satisfied."
16,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,16,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In support of this effort, we were undertaking steps to secure our supply chain, properly reallocate our resources and device contingency plans to aggressively meet the challenges facing all of us today. From a supply chain perspective, we're functioning fairly well despite the disruption from COVID-19. As the crisis continues, we're running numerous contingency scenarios to mitigate these challenges as much as possible. In addition, our leadership team in all our locations around the world are engaging with their local communities and hospitals to support urgent needs in the areas."
17,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,17,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Turning now to the review of each of our lines of business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, approximately 41% of revenues came from our Specialty Memory Products business, 36% from our Brazil business and 23% from our Specialty Computing Products business."
18,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,18,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Starting now with Specialty Memory, which represented 41% of overall revenue and achieved about $111 million in revenues in the quarter. Our revenues in this quarter were 8% higher than the previous quarter despite some supply shortages and some shutdowns by our China-based suppliers. During the quarter, we introduced some of the first of a range of specialty SSD products based on our own recently developed firmware and controller technologies. Also, we're seeing a strong pipeline of new opportunities as we ramp up our sales efforts focused on a broader base of customers in new areas such as medical, industrial, defense and security."
19,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,19,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"During the second quarter, we had one of our strongest performances in terms of new design wins that resulted in additional customers and orders, some of which will start shipping as early as the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. For example, the increase in IoT processing at the edge of the network is driving more demand for storage. And we won a new customer in the area of body cameras, a market segment where we were not present before. In addition, we had a very strong bookings quarter for our NVDIMM products, which offer a low-density alternative to 3D Crosspoint technology-based products."
20,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,20,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Moving on now to our Brazil business, which grew by 4% over the previous quarter to reach $98 million in revenue approximately, 36% of our overall revenue. Brazil outperformed our expectations in what is normally a seasonally weak quarter due to calendar year-end shutdowns and holidays. Our mobile memory products experienced higher selling prices as we saw significant increases in the average density of mobile memory products shipped in the period. We've also had some exciting new mobile memory product introductions and products and qualification at our customers. Also, our DRAM products in Brazil performed well in the quarter and pricing held steady."
21,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,21,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In Brazil, with the new manufacturing rules in place as of July last year and with our customers now clear about the new tax incentives that were signed into law at the end of December last year, we're now getting longer-term forecasts, and we are also participating to a greater degree in the higher-density product demand. Another new area of progress for our business in Brazil is the introduction of a line of LoRa-based IoT products for smart cities applications. We've received the first trial orders for some of these products. As you may know, LoRa is a long range, low power wireless technology that's become a de facto technology for IoT networks worldwide."
22,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,22,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"While it's difficult to anticipate the effects of COVID-19-related effects on the economy and operations in Brazil as well as the significant weakening of the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar that has happened recently, longer term, we remain optimistic about the prospects for profitable growth from this part of our business."
23,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,23,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Our Specialty Computing line of business totaled $63 million of revenue in the quarter, representing approximately 23% of overall revenue. While this is also a seasonally weak period for this line of business, revenues in the quarter were further lower than expected due to delays of certain government-related orders. However, we've made significant progress in improving gross margins through operational improvements, integration and an improved mix of business with an increasing share of revenues coming from services in this business."
24,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,24,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"You may recall that this business can be lumpy and is dependent on large projects, particularly those for government agencies. The quarter was also notable in terms of our strong bookings of multiyear managed services contracts, which led to our strongest booking quarter ever in this business in terms of total contract value. During the quarter, we introduced the first of our solution sets for different vertical applications, utilizing GPU, or graphics processors, and CPU technologies, integrated with our networking and cluster management software tools for AI, HPC and other modeling and analytics applications. These solution set offerings are now leading our new systems bookings."
25,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,25,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We're entering the second half of our fiscal year with a robust pipeline for new business across Specialty Compute and a solid competitive position post the recent industry consolidation, which has happened. And this has put us in a -- put us forward as a strong alternative for many large projects. Additionally, more and more applications are emerging driven by AI, edge computing and also, we're seeing new applications in our wireless computing products where we continue to win new designs in partnership with Qualcomm. We remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects across all of our specialty computing areas."
26,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,26,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"To further drive our efforts in these areas, we've integrated the management and many engineering, services and sales organizations across Embedded Computing and Penguin Computing businesses. This will help to drive further operating cost improvements as well as a broader set of product offerings to the marketplace and a stronger go-to-market effort."
27,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,27,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In conclusion, these are clearly challenging times for all of us to navigate and indeed to forecast. However, the long-term underlying business trends point toward an increasing need for more data center, cloud and AI-related capabilities as well as greater requirements for specialized application-specific memory solutions, all of which leave us confident in our position to meet these demands in the future."
28,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,28,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, in examining our portfolio, our lines of business have very limited exposure to affected end markets such as automotive, travel and hospitality and real estate. We do have some exposure to oil and gas, and particularly in Brazil, to the consumer market. That said, we have a significant position in stronger end markets such as enterprise and infrastructure computing and communications, AI and HPC, government and defense applications and in enterprise computing -- in enterprise storage. We're in a strong financial position with over $140 million in cash and minimal current debt."
29,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,29,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We have indeed run many financial simulations and scenarios and feel comfortable with our ability to withstand a prolonged downturn. As I said before, this should enable us to weather this storm and to be well positioned for the opportunities that will emerge."
30,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,30,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"With that, let me turn the call over to Jack for a review of our financials and our guidance. Jack?"
31,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,31,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Ajay. Overall, gross revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $420.9 million, while net sales were $272 million. As a reminder, the difference between gross revenue and net sales is related to our Supply Chain Services business, which is accounted for on an agency basis, meaning that we only recognize as net sales the net profit on Supply Chain Services transaction."
32,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,32,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"A breakdown of net sales by end market, the second fiscal quarter was as follows: mobile and PCs, 34%; network and telecom, 24%; servers and storage, 11%; industrial, defense and other, 31%."
33,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,33,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Now moving to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross profit for the second quarter was $52.9 million compared with last quarter's $55.7 million, primarily due to product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $35.6 million compared with $37.5 million in the previous quarter as we had lower audit stocks as well as trade show-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $12.8 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared with $13.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the previous quarter, and adjusted EBITDA totaled $22.3 million compared with $23.5 million in the prior quarter."
34,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,34,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Turning to working capital. Our net accounts receivable totaled $217.4 million compared with $228.8 million last quarter. Our days sales outstanding decreased to 47 days for this quarter compared with 50 days last quarter. Inventory totaled $161.4 million at the end of the second quarter compared with $160 million at the end of the first quarter. Inventory turns remained flat at around 9% for both quarters. Consistent with past practice, accounts receivable, days outstanding and inventory turnover are calculated on a gross sales and cost of goods sold basis, which were $420.9 million and $369.4 million, respectively, for the second quarter."
35,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,35,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,We entered the second quarter with $141.9 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $111.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Second quarter cash flow from operations totaled $23.3 million compared with $25.3 million in the prior quarter. We exited our second quarter with a very strong balance sheet as well as a vastly improved capital structure.
36,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,36,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"We issued $250 million of convertible notes on February 11, 2020, and used $204.9 million of the proceeds to pay off our existing term loan, thereby extending our debt maturity out to 2026, which means we do not have any term loan debt payments for 6 years. We also used $21.8 million of proceeds to purchase capped calls, which is expected to reduce dilution to the shareholders upon conversion of the notes."
37,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,37,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"The maturity of our $50 million revolving line of credit was also extended out 5 years. We did not have any revolver drawdown at the end of Q2 nor do we anticipate during the third quarter as we expect to continue to generate cash during our third quarter. Completing our debt refinancing reduces our cash spend on interest as well as our interest expense booked each quarter by over $3 million per quarter. And this, along with eliminating our cash spend on amortizing our debt each quarter, which was approximately $5.6 million, will save us over $9 million in cash per quarter, beginning in our third quarter. For those of you tracking CapEx and depreciation, CapEx was $4.2 million for the quarter and depreciation was $6 million."
38,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,38,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"And now let me touch on some of the financial and operational dynamics we are currently facing. At this time, all of our manufacturing facilities across the globe are operating and servicing our customers, as Ajay mentioned earlier. We're still seeing strong demand from our customers in our third quarter, and our guidance reflects this current view of the quarter. We have analyzed and continued to assess our customers and their end markets for weaknesses and strength, i.e., oil and gas is expected to be weaker, while our networking, telecom, server and storage businesses, which are some of our largest end markets, looks to be performing stronger due to the increased demand for cloud, Internet services and telecom."
39,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,39,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"The worldwide crisis due to COVID-19 has also further weakened the Brazilian real to new levels. We are not seeing this impact consumer spending yet but believe it could have a negative impact on the Brazilian economy, which had expected positive GDP growth for 2020. We have taken a number of steps to minimize its impact on the company by having foreign exchange forward contracts for accounts payable, which we believe should minimize FX losses from payments. As a reminder, we price in U.S. dollars, and we convert to the real when we invoice in order to minimize any negative impact to us. We will continue to monitor the situation in Brazil very carefully and work to minimize any resulting impact to our business."
40,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,40,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"With that as a backdrop, let me now turn to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We currently estimate that our third quarter net sales will be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. The midpoint of which represents an increase of 5% sequentially. Gross margin for the quarter is estimated to be approximately 20% to 22%. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be approximately $0.33 per share, plus or minus $0.05. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding share-based compensation expense and intangible asset amortization expense, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $0.68, plus or minus $0.05, the midpoint of which represents an increase of 31% sequentially."
41,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,41,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,The guidance for the third fiscal quarter does not include any view on the foreign exchange gains or losses or a mark-to-market adjustment for our capped call and includes an income tax provision expected to be in the range of 14% to 18%. The number of shares used to estimate earnings per diluted share for the third fiscal quarter is 24.6 million. Capital expenditures for the third fiscal quarter are expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million.
42,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,42,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results and reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA tables in our earnings press release for further details. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."
