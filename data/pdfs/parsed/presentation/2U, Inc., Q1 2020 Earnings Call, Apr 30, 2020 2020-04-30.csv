[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Goodwin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours."
1,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,1,Ed Goodwin,Vice President of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to 2U's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Chip Paucek, our CEO; and Paul Lalljie, our CFO. Following Chip and Paul's prepared remarks, we will take questions. This call is being simultaneously webcast on our website where you can find our press release which was issued after the close of the market as well as our earnings presentation. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements regarding our financial and operating results, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, new educational offerings, student and university demand and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our analysis of today -- as of today, and we have no plans or duty to update them. Please refer to the earnings press release and the risk factors described in the documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of 2U's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non- GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, let me hand it over to Chip."
2,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,2,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Ed. I hope everyone's been safe, healthy and holding up as well as possible during these unprecedented times. It's clearly challenging for all companies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and 2U is no exception. With that said, we're in the midst of witnessing a paradigm-shifting moment for online education, from which I believe 2U will emerge substantially stronger."
3,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,3,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In some ways, right now, we're at the epicenter of what higher education is dealing with. The last 4 weeks have been intense for the business. As COVID-19 was beginning here in the U.S., 2U had to decide whether to hold our Investor Day. We did it virtually and it went well. As the pandemic continued to unfold, we successfully completed a convertible debt offering. In the context of conducting an offering in this rapidly evolving and unpredictable environment, we provided strong preliminary first quarter results and withdrew guidance. Paul and his team has done a great job of adding liquidity to the balance sheet in a tricky capital markets environment, while providing a more robust capital structure and enhancing our financial flexibility. That's a big win for all of our stakeholders."
4,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,4,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Before going into more detail on our results and our business outlook, I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities. Even with significant disruptions across the globe, our strategy is unchanged. We partner with top-tier universities to build, deliver and support world-class digital education offerings that drive strong student outcomes. In light of the pandemic, our financial priorities are unwavering. We're focused on driving our market-leading position, accelerating the growth of the company and driving towards free cash flow and profitability."
5,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,5,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the rest of today's call, I'll address how our business performed in the first quarter. And I'll provide an overview of the trends we're beginning to see in our business that we expect to continue, followed with detail on some of the solutions we're offering to universities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll then turn it over to Paul, who will walk you through our results with more detail and commentary."
6,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,6,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Starting with our first quarter results, which were quite strong. Revenue grew 44% year-over-year to $175.5 million, driven by performance in the Graduate segment and the addition of Trilogy, which we acquired in May 2019. The Grad segment exceeded our expectations, with revenue growth of 14%, a 2- point acceleration over last quarter. As we described to you at Investor Day, this was again driven by the scaling of programs launched over the last 3 years. On the bottom line, we came in significantly above our expectations for adjusted EBITDA with a loss of $4.3 million for the quarter. This outperformance was driven by cost controls implemented last year as well as lower costs due to our teams working remotely. This quarter, our teams delivered strong top line growth, accelerating organic growth with strong bottom line performance, only to be outdone by unlevered free cash flow usage that is the lowest it's been for 6 quarters."
7,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,7,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We performed exceptionally well. Our results for January and February exceeded our expectations. And due to the flexibility and variability of our expense base and the resilience of our business model, we were well situated to adjust as social distancing was enacted."
8,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education and our business has continued to evolve week-by-week, even day-by-day. And we like where we sit today, our business is fully operational. Our programs are online. And each day brings greater clarity through the data we're seeing throughout the entire business. Given most recent movements in the business, our confidence is increasing in the longer term impact. As part of this, I want to present some early conclusions as to what we think this impact might be."
9,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"First, we all witnessed how COVID-19 created an urgent need for every university to move their programs online. This rush to remote learning happened almost overnight. A lot has changed in the last 6 weeks. And today, we know much more based on the daily conversations we've been having with partners across our portfolio. We now believe that this forced transition online will substantially increase the demand from universities for our core product offerings and new solutions. The need to deliver truly high-quality online programs, not just remote live lectures at a time when universities are facing unprecedented financial constraints and challenges, makes our traditional full investment model even more compelling and valuable. We can call this already. We could not say that 3 or 4 weeks ago, but it's now apparent. We expect to announce our next undergraduate program shortly."
10,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Second, we expect to see increasing student demand for quality online offerings. The data here is early, but our funnels are filling and converting currently at higher rates than before the pandemic. Historically, the higher education market has been negatively correlated to the overall state of the economy. There's a long history here. We've seen some prognosticators question publicly whether this recession could be different for higher education. But based on some leading indicators in our business that have been offerings will see countercyclical demand. While it's still in early days in the grand scheme of things, we expect that this trend will increase over time. Notably, prospective students have been easier to get in touch with and have been more receptive to engaging in substantive conversations. One other interesting tidbit. While the initial stages of COVID-19 caused some demand decreases on the boot camp side, the last several weeks have shown even greater conversion as online options became the norm. Clearly, as 2U has seen in its long history, students want online learning even in the boot camp space. We think that this move to online for boot camps will not be temporary."
11,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Third, as online learning becomes the norm now and into the fall, we believe that prospective students will increasingly view online programs as attractive alternatives to campus space programs. Quality will matter here. And when done right, as our recent Gallup study proves, online can be as good or even better than the campus. We expect that, over time, a great percentage -- a greater percentage of total students will enroll in online programs, both degrees and alternative credentials, than what we've seen in the past."
12,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Fourth, we're seeing advertising costs decrease during this time. We have no idea how long this will continue but it is allowing us to drive positive enrollments for our clients right when they need it most. One example, our undergraduate program is seeing double-digit increases in volume on a daily basis. We believe that the launch of these high-quality undergrad online offerings, which occurred right before the outbreak, are now meeting an even bigger need in the market."
13,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Before I turn it over to Paul, I also want to highlight some of the new solutions we're offering based on the trends we've heard from our partners. There's now No Back Row PRO, where we provide free training to our university partners' campus-based faculty on best practices for successful online teaching. These efforts continue to raise interest in and awareness of our high-quality learning platform and our significant expertise in this area. We expect that this offering will become even more important as universities and faculty figure out their plans for the fall and how to build online into their go-forward strategy. Then there's Studio-in-a-box, our modified course production approach, which allows faculty to record asynchronous content directly from their home with the right tools and virtual assistance from a 2U course designer. We've also deployed 2 new solutions, 2U OS Essential and Plus. These provide a lighter deployment of 2U OS and enable continuity and quality for existing and new university partners in preparation for the fall. We do not yet know how many of these deployments we will have. We expect to offer these on a fee or revenue share basis depending on the interest of a client. We'll provide more information on future calls, but it's going well."
14,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, with increased pipeline opportunities in mind, I want to be clear, we are still focused on continuing our drive to profitable revenue growth. As we gain clarity on these new opportunities, we'll provide more clarity to all of you. But we want to make sure you're aware that regardless of the broader opportunity set, we're being careful in our decisions. To conclude, we delivered strong Q1 results, even in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. For much of our portfolio, there was little or no disruption to operations and through team effort and extraordinary collaboration, all 2U-powered offerings remain up and running and continue to enroll new students. I'd like to thank our partners and employees for the dedication they've shown over the past 2 months. 2Utes have been incredible, even though they've all been remote. It makes me very proud. The COVID-19 pandemic created an urgent need for every university to up its game on online education and we are uniquely positioned to help them meet this increasing need. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."
15,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Chip, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that the fundamentals of our business are strong. We had a good first quarter in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic with execution of business continuity plans limiting disruption. We recently issued $380 million in convertible notes which lowered our cost of capital while giving us increased liquidity and financial flexibility, and we continued to see strength in our university pipeline. As the world responds to the crisis, we're in an excellent position to be a solution for our university partners and their students in a variety of ways."
16,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"On this call, I'll go over our results for the quarter in more detail, discuss our recent capital raise then give quarter. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $175.5 million, a 44% increase from $122.2 million. Organic revenue growth was 15%, an acceleration of 2 percentage points from last quarter, driven primarily by strength in the Grad segment. In the Graduate Program segment, revenue grew 14% over the first quarter of last year. This was driven by a 16% increase in full course equivalents partially offset by a 2% decline in revenue per FCE year-over-year. Revenue per FCE was essentially flat versus last quarter. For the first quarter, revenue in the Alternative Credential segment totaled $57 million, which includes $35.4 million from Trilogy. FCEs for the segment were up 66% while revenue per FCE was up 90%. Short Course revenue increased 20%, with programs launched in the past year, contributing nicely to the growth."
17,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Let's look at costs and expenses. Total operating expense for the quarter came in at $229.4 million, a 56% year-over-year increase. Total marketing and sales expense grew 29% year-over-year. In response to COVID-19, we spent less than we had originally planned, which speaks volumes to the variable nature of our marketing spend. Looking forward, we continue to adjust our marketing spend on what we're seeing in the market with a goal of spending to the efficient marketing frontier. Net loss for the quarter was $60.1 million compared to net loss of $21.6 million for the first quarter of 2019. This was driven in part by an incremental $11.3 million in stock-based compensation due to changes in our compensation structure and additional headcount from Trilogy. There was also an incremental $9.4 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the Trilogy acquisition. Adjusted net loss for the quarter totaled $21.3 million when adjusted for $20.9 million in stock-based compensation, $10.8 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets as well as certain nonordinary course items."
18,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Now for a discussion of the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $157.5 million, a decrease of $32.4 million from $189.9 million at the end of the December quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by use of cash from operations of $9.9 million and CapEx of $18.2 million as well as cash interest payments of $4.9 million. Unlevered free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a use of $58.5 million, a $21.7 million improvement from the December quarter. This highlights our commitment to drive towards positive free cash flow and puts us ahead of our initial plan. This performance was driven by more efficient use of net working capital, and we expect this improvement to continue."
19,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Accounts receivable was $75.4 million at the end of this quarter, up $41.7 million from the end of 2019. This is typical for us in the first quarter. The seasonal increase in accounts receivable in the first quarter relative to last year, is due to the timing of the academic calendar. Of note, 86% of the accounts receivable balance is current. This increase in AR is offset by a $23.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $21 million increase in deferred revenue from last quarter as we continue to manage net working capital."
20,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"At the end of the first quarter, we had outstanding long-term debt of $254.1 million, principally related to our term loan facility which had a maturity of May 2024. We recently issued $380 million in 5-year convertible notes with a coupon of 2.25%, including the over-allotment option, which is expected to close tomorrow. We have since repaid all outstanding amounts under our term loan, with the remaining net proceeds going towards purchasing a capped call and funding net working capital and other general corporate purposes."
21,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We are fortunate to execute on this opportunistic financing, which offers us a number of benefits as compared to the term loan. It reduces our annual cash interest expense by around $11 million, it eliminates restrictive covenant, it extends the maturity date to 2025 and it enhances our financial flexibility. We are well funded to execute against our strategic priorities as we view our capital allocation decisions through the lens of balancing growth, return on invested capital and cash generation."
22,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Now for a discussion of how we're thinking about the rest of the year. We're in an unprecedented environment with uncertainty about the future progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by the government and how they will respond to the pandemic, what this means for the economy in the coming months. The prudent thing to do in this environment is to maintain our disciplined approach to managing capital and expenses. We have continued to constrain any unnecessary spending and tighten our use of cash even further without impacting growth. This will give us the greatest possible strategic and financial flexibility in this environment to further cement our market-leading position. While our possible with reasonable accuracy to estimate the positive or negative impact of the pandemic on our 2020 financial performance. To that end, in connection with our convertible offering, we have withdrawn our financial guidance for the fiscal year, and we intend to defer providing new guidance until there is a clearer outlook on the duration and magnitude of the pandemic. To summarize, we got off to a strong start to the year, building on the momentum from the fourth quarter of last year. We successfully shifted to working from home without disruption, and we're helping our partners lead the way for online education going forward. We are especially well positioned to help because we came into this pandemic as a market leader with momentum. We are investing, and we are well capitalized: $175.5 million in revenue, adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.3 million, unlevered free cash flow usage of $17.6 million for the quarter and an improved capital structure. We are proud of our teams for delivering such strong results and we are confident that they will continue to make us proud. And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator?"
