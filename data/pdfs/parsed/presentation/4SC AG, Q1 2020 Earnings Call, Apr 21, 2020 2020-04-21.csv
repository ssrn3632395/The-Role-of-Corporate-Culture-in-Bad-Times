3,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,3,Larissa Stuttem,Team Assistant,EXECUTIVES,"I'm sure you have already seen our press release this morning, and the presentation for this call is also available for download on the website.

4,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,4,Larissa Stuttem,Team Assistant,EXECUTIVES,"Before I hand over to Jason, I would like to give you all a brief reminder. During today's conference call, we may make projections or estimates regarding plans and objectives relating to our future operations, products, services or future financial results or assumptions underlying or relating to any such statements, each of which constitute a forward-looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially depending on a number of factors."

6,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,6,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Larissa, and welcome, everybody, to the Q1 conf call. I will work from the slide deck that's on the website, as Larissa indicated. Starting on Slide 3, which is simply an overview of the company as we stood at the end of Q1, and I think the key highlights from the first quarter."
7,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,7,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"So from an employee point of view, we still have 46 people in the company, which is more or less where we finished 2019 as well as both drugs resminostat and domatinostat in clinical development as well."
8,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,8,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"The stock market details are shown on the bottom on the right-hand side. But I think I want to really bring everybody's attention to, I think, 3 very important pieces of news in the first quarter and significant advance for our clinical studies."
9,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,9,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"On RESMAIN, we completed the enrollment of 150 patients at the end of 2019. And the Data Safety Monitoring Board looked at the cumulative safety data on these patients in Q1 and recommended continuation of the study. That will be the last DSMB meeting before we hopefully conclude recruitment of the study and publish the top line data."
10,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,10,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"With domatinostat, I see 2 important pieces of news but first on MERKLIN-2, where we entered into a supply agreement with Merck and Pfizer for avelumab for the MERKLIN-2 study, which is a clinical study of domatinostat in combination with avelumab in patients that have progressed on checkpoint therapy. And that study has now been accepted to start in the United States with our IND having been agreed to by FDA, and we hope to start that study as soon as possible in the current circumstances."
11,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,11,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, with respect to DONIMI, which is our study of domatinostat and in the adjuvant setting in melanoma. The first patient was enrolled in the first quarter of 2020 as expected."
12,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,12,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to Slide 4 and the financial review and outlook. At the end of Q1 2020, the company had a cash balance of just over EUR 40 million, which is on budget as we currently plan. Spending in the first quarter was slightly below what we forecast for the year at EUR 1.677 million, but we would hold our forecast for the rest of the year at between EUR 2.2 million and EUR 2.6 million per quarter -- per month, sorry. The funds that we have at the bank, we still expect to see or to be sufficient for the company to continue operating into the second half of 2021."
13,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,13,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to Slide 5 and the operational outlook. Obviously, the operational aspects of 4SC have been affected by the current coronavirus crisis, which I think everybody is aware of. With respect to RESMAIN, at the end of the first quarter, we had enrolled an additional 5 patients and completed the quarter with 155 patients enrolled in the study."
14,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,14,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"With respect to domatinostat, we had initiated 4 clinical studies, all of which are now temporarily suspended or were suspended at the end of the first quarter as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic. I think here, what's important is that we're doing everything possible to maintain the safety and the well-being of patients that are all enrolled in our studies and to maintain patients on study protocols so that we continue to ensure data quality and data integrity."
15,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,15,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"We are in touch with all the clinical centers that 4SC is engaged with on all of these studies and are actively reviewing on almost a day-by-day basis when we might be able to restart recruitment. And on this front, we have, I think, 2 pieces of quite positive news. The first is with respect to DONIMI. With this study, recruitment will restart this week in the Netherlands, so that study is no longer being suspended but is open to recruitment, and we are proceeding with the opening of the second center, which is in Australia for this study. So it's continuing after, I'd say, a very short interruption of coronavirus."
16,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,16,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"And in respect to SENSITIZE, where we're currently recruiting cohort 4 of that study, we have 2 German centers of the 5 that we have available for that study now reopening again this week for recruitment. So that study will actively continue as of this week."
17,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",Presentation,17,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, on Slide 6, just to bring to your notice, the Annual General Meeting, which we have announced will be held on the 8th of May. So it's actually not that far away from today, a couple of weeks. This will be a virtual meeting, which will be the first for 4SC, and this will be held under the new legislation that has been agreed in Germany to allow AGMs to continue in the current circumstances. And we hope to provide or we will provide a further update on operations at this meeting as it's only 3 weeks away. With that, I conclude my presentation for today and pass back to Megan to open the call for Q&A."
