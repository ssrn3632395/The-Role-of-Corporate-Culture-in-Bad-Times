9,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I will then turn the call over to Drew to discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their extraordinary efforts during this challenging time. They have worked tirelessly to ensure that the bank's operations are run smoothly and our support to our customers and communities remains uninterrupted. The safety of our employees and customers is our top priority.
10,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I want to share with you all a brief story of how we found ourselves in the door of the COVID crisis. I had been attending a bank conference in Switzerland in February as the pandemic was beginning to flare uncontrollably in Italy, where I was also scheduled to travel for meetings. Needless to say, I can't put my trip around and headed back to New York as my proximity to the pandemic opened my eyes to the risk that it held not only to the U.S., but New York City, in particular."
11,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,This was truly a case of being in the wrong place at the right time and I knew that our crisis management team needed to put our pandemic plan into place as I believed the shut-in of New York was imminent. Our crisis team implemented plans to move to almost 100% of our employees to a work from home environment by the middle of March and we have quickly adapted to this new normal.
12,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our managers are checking with their direct reports daily to ensure that our operations continue to run smoothly and I'm very pleased to report that our staff is seamlessly handling transactions and making new loans. I'm very proud of their efforts and we have not missed a beat.
13,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Since our founding almost 100 years ago, we have had a commitment to the greater good, which has shaped the business model and our values. We believe that a financial institution mission should include using its resources, money and influence to help move its customers, its community and society forward. While we find ourselves in an unprecedented environment, our mission and values are unchanged and they continue to guide our senior leadership team and the decisions that we make as we navigate these unchartered waters."
14,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"First and foremost, we remain committed to our employees, having repositioned branch staff to other areas of the bank's operations that have seen an increase in activity. We are committed to the physical, emotional and financial health of our team and have no plans to lay off our employees during this uncertain time. We also remain committed to our community and those in need. I'm amazed and thankful for the efforts of those that are battling this crisis on the frontlines and I'm very pleased that we were able to create the Frontline Workers Fund, which offers direct assistance to nurses and healthcare workers, grocery workers, cleaning service workers, foodservice workers, laundry workers in our hospitals and retail workers, to name just a few."
15,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We also launched the Families and Workers Fund in partnership with a consortium of foundations, whose goal is to provide financial resources to vulnerable working families across the country. This fund has initial commitment of $7.1 million and the goal is to raise $20 million in order to provide flexible funding to organizations striving to prevent workers and families from sinking deeper into levels of poverty during the initial months of this pandemic."
16,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"All of this would not be possible without the strategic transformation that Amalgamated has undergone in the last six years. When I was appointed CEO in 2014, our team undertook a broad plan designed to unlock the profit potential of the bank, which included recruiting talented executives from across the banking industry, growing our customer base, instilling a disciplined expense culture and improving the quality of both our assets and sources of funding. This has led to a stable, low-cost deposit base. We have also closed unprofitable business lines and significantly reduced our brand footprint. Most importantly, we have re-instilled a disciplined credit culture, which has resulted in strong credit performance of our loan portfolio."
17,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As part of our comprehensive credit risk management process, we made the decision to run off our indirect C&I portfolio and significantly de-risked our balance sheet over the last two years, which I'm very grateful for given the current market backdrop. Today the bank is on firm financial footing with a strong capital base and a well underwritten loan portfolio as can be seen in our first quarter results and which provides confidence in our ability to weather the storm."
18,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For the first quarter, we reported first, pre-tax pre-provision income of $25.5 million, which compares to $16.5 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. We grew average deposits by $400 million or 36% annualized as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our cost of deposits was 33 basis points, down from 36 basis points in Q4 and non-interest bearing deposits were 48% of ending deposits."
19,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our net interest margin expanded three basis points to 3.46% from the 2019 fourth quarter. Importantly our efficiency ratio improved to 59.97% and we remain well capitalized with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 12.74% as Drew will discuss in more detail. We recorded a provision expense of $8.6 million, primarily driven by $3.4 million dollars in our indirect C&I portfolio and $3 million in qualitative factors, both largely due to the impact of COVID-19."
20,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are watching our loan portfolio carefully and are proactively working with our borrowers in more challenging industries on payment due for us to help them through this time period. While we expect provision to go higher, we remain confident in our strong credit culture and believe we are well capitalized to handle an even more severe recession. It is important to emphasize that our core customers, our unions and non-profits are not primarily credit customers. These customers in their relationships with us are primarily on the deposit side of the bank. Additionally, though we are based and headquartered in"
21,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"New York City, our credit exposure is more broad based geographically. We have also been aggressively reducing expenses to ensure we remain well positioned to handle an extended downturn, while not sacrificing the underlying fabric of our business."
22,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our focus has been on reducing some deposit expense, initiating a hiring freeze beginning in April, cutting back on non-essential projects, shifting resources internally, most specifically at the branch level, improving call center operations and canceling unnecessary services. We expect these steps to help mitigate the impact of lower interest in equity market values on our revenue. We have an experienced team in place that is executing the necessary adjustments on not taking out costs that will affect the operational capabilities or competitive position of our business on a go-forward basis. Looking forward, we understand that the future is uncertain, and we are opportunistically managing our noninterest expense to maintain our financial flexibility and ensure the long-term success of the bank."
23,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"One growth initiative that we have moved forward with is the opening of our commercial banking office in Boston. I'm very pleased to announce that we have hired [Mark Wash] to head the office and oversee a team. Mark has over 13 years of experience as a leader in the non-profit and political sectors in the Boston area, and brings a wealth of local knowledge to the bank Given the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders that continue to exist, we expect the ramp of our Boston office to be more gradual that we are already starting to see new client acquisition, and we will delay the opening of our Los Angeles office until the environment begins to normalize."
24,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our capital allocation priorities, we have suspended our share buyback, given the uncertain economic environment, and we will evaluate our dividend with our Board of Directors each quarter. That said, we announced yesterday a second quarter dividend of $0.08 per share. Additionally, we are watching the economy closely and aggressively managing our business to adapt to this new environment. While M&A has been a growth driver for the bank, we will remain on the sidelines until we have more clarity on the recovery. Given our positioning and capital, we would look to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves as a recovery takes hold and the economy begins to normalize."
25,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'm also very proud of our mission-aligned initiatives and accomplishments that we have achieved thus far in 2020. Of note, we launched our Corporate Social Responsibility Report on April 13, which provides a comprehensive overview of our CSR policies, strategies, and initiatives. Our CSR report provides a wonderful overview of all the good that Amalgamated is doing in the world, and we continue to build on our reputation as America's socially responsible bank every day. I am also pleased to see that our initiatives and efforts are being recognized, as MSCI raised our ESG score from BBB to A, and we improved our Certified B Corporation score to 115 from 87. To conclude, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and the positioning of our loan portfolio, as the country works together to the defeat the spread of COVID-19."
26,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We remain well capitalized to successfully weather the storm and take advantage of opportunities that we people, clients, and customers first, and we'll work with them through this period of uncertainty. I would like to thank all of our employees again, who have worked tirelessly over the last eight weeks to make our mission possible. And together, we will see this through."
27,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I'd now like to turn the call over to Drew for a more detailed review of our financial results.
28,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Keith. I will begin by reviewing our first quarter results, before turning the line back to the operator to open for questions."
29,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, ending deposits increased $435.6 million or 37.5% annualized to $5.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2019, while average deposits for the quarter were $4.8 billion. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased $276.5 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonality related to the election cycle, and now represent 48% of average deposits at quarter end. Our cost of deposits decreased to 33 basis points, down three basis points compared to 36 basis points at year's end. As Keith mentioned, we expect the cost of deposits to continue decreasing as a result of re- pricing in reaction to the Fed cutting rates to near zero."
30,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Deposits from politically active customers, such as campaigns, PACs and state and national party committees, increased $196.2 million from $578.6 million at December 31, 2019 and in the first quarter at $774.8 million as outlined on Slide 8. The election environment continues to be a source of growth for our deposit franchise. The focus for this year will be the presidential race. We have and continue to be a partner supporting the business needs of the majority of Democratic candidates."
31,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"It's worth noting that in April, we continue to see an influx of deposits and balances have increased another $247 million since the end of the first quarter, of which $47 million were from political deposits. As a result of the deposit growth, the bank just crossed the $6 billion mark in total assets."
32,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As seen on Slide 11, we delivered loan growth of $76.2 million or 8.9% annualized as compared to December 31, 2019 and ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of total loans. This loan growth was driven primarily by an increase in C&I loans of $58 million of which $24 million was the purchase of government guaranteed loans. An increase in residential loans of $50 million and consumer loans of $26 million. The growth was offset by a $53 million decrease in commercial real estate and multifamily loans due to payoffs, where we chose not to match the terms of other lenders to retain the loans."
33,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As a reminder, our balance of PACE assessments is now reported in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio, which is inclusive of approximately $255 million in purchase PACE assessments. Our new investment in PACE Funding Group will allow the bank to continue adding PACE assessments in the future. So the trend maybe slower than originally anticipated due to the ongoing pandemic."
34,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As part of the Cures Act, the bank has implemented a payment deferral program for consumer and commercial customers. The standard agreement allows for three months of deferrals of principal and interest. These loans are not reported as delinquent on our financial statements and are not downgraded solely due to the payment deferral program."
35,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,35,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In total, we have set up approximately 9% of our loans on a deferral program, which is shown on Slide 14. We expect that number to grow over the coming weeks, particularly for commercial clients who are still going through the process."
36,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,36,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 15, we have highlighted our residential loan portfolio by origination source. All portfolios have strong loan-to-value coverage and it's worth noting this is compared to the original appraisal on the property and not adjusted for HPI increases over time. These requests in the residential portfolio were heavy in the first part of April, but has since slowed down."
37,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,37,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving to Slide 16, we are showing the portfolios in C&I and CRE where we expect to see COVID-19 impacts. In the C&I portfolio, we have $112 million or 3.2% of total loans that are in industries that are deferrals. Multifamily and commercial real estate, we've had many inquiries from property owners on payment deferral options."
38,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,38,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As of April 24, $155 million of balances have received payment deferrals. Unlike the residential portfolio, the request from commercial clients have been slower and we expect this number will continue to increase throughout the second quarter."
39,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,39,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our investment securities portfolio has also seen impacts on the mark to market for the available for sale securities during the first quarter. In the last few weeks of March, the fixed income markets for non- agency securities was particularly volatile and the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio decreased by $25 million compared to year-end 2019, which was an improvement from the lows of mid- March. Since the end of Q1 values have continued to improve, but there may be more volatility in the future."
40,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,40,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to slide 18. Our net interest margin was 3.46% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from the fourth quarter and a year-over-year decrease of 19 basis points. The increase in NIM compared to a linked quarter was primarily due to the lower cost of interest bearing liabilities as a cost of interest bearing deposits drop by 5 basis points and borrowing costs were essentially zero due to deposit growth."
41,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,41,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,First quarter NIM includes 4 basis points of accretion of the loan mark from the new resource bank acquisition. 6 basis points from pre-payment penalties on loans as compared to 5 and 2 basis points respectively in the fourth quarter of 2019.
42,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,42,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"On a go-forward basis, we expect NIM to decline in the second quarter as we start to see the impacts of the most recent [Fed cuts] to zero, which will be partially offset by deposit cost reductions. In addition, the inflow of deposits have been more heavily deployed in the floating rate agency securities were held in cash in the second quarter and that will also pressure net interest margin."
43,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,43,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Net interest income for the first quarter of 2020 was $44.7 million which compares to $42.3 million in the linked quarter and an approximately $3.9 million increase as compared to $40.8 million in the same quarter of 2019.
44,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,44,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Now on to non-interest income. Non-interest income from the first quarter of 2020 was $9.1 million increasing from $7.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 and a $1.7 million increase compared with the first quarter of 2019. The main factor for the growth in the quarter was the sale of our Tremont branch for a gain of $1.4 million which has been excluded from core net income.
45,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,45,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As Keith mentioned, the initiatives to reduce non-interest expense on a go-forward basis. For the first quarter of 2020 our net interest expense decreased to $32.3 million dollars compared to $33.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter."
46,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,46,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"This quarter's expense included $1.4 million of non-core expense primarily related to branch closures, which will not recur next quarter. On a core basis, our expenses were $30.8 million, which reflects our ongoing expense discipline. As Keith mentioned earlier, we are focusing on expense management as part of our pandemic response initiatives and we expect to run expenses below $32 million per quarter for the remainder of the year."
47,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,47,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Skipping ahead to Slide 21, the credit quality of our portfolio is held steady throughout the first quarter, as nonperforming assets totaled $65.6 million or 1.14% of period end total assets at March 31, 2020 compared to 1.25% as of December 31 2019. A decrease of $1.1 million from the linked quarter and an increase of $9.1 million as compared to March 31 2019."
48,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,48,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Criticized and classified loans increased by approximately $16 million in the first quarter compared to the linked quarter driven primarily by the downgrade of one construction loan on the West Coast of $7.9 million and an increase in C&I and retail.
49,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,49,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2020 totaled an expense of $8.6 million, which was primarily driven by an increase in specific reserves of $3.4 million and two loans in the indirect C&I portfolio, which were impacted by COVID-19 issues and the addition of $3 million to the qualitative reserves. The indirect C&I loans were previously TDRs and were not eligible for the payment deferral treatment afforded by the CARES Act."
50,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,50,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,We do expect to have an elevated level of provision in the second quarter as we continue to update qualitative factors is based on information available in the second quarter. Charge-offs on currently delinquent consumer loans may also be elevated in the second quarter if those loans are not deemed to be impacted by COVID-19 and are not eligible for deferral.
51,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,51,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Skipping to Slide 21. Our GAAP and core return on tangible common equity, were 7.6% and 7.7% for the first quarter of 2020 respectively. The core return compares to 10.7% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 10.2% for the comparable period in 2019."
52,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,52,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The decrease in core return on tangible common equity in the linked quarter was primarily due to the previously discussed provision taken related to COVID-19. Lastly, we remain well-capitalized to support future growth."
53,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,53,Andrew LaBenne,Senior Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"To conclude, we are pleased with our first quarter 2020 results given all the events that have occurred. Given the fluid environment today and the uncertainty that exists, we have decided to suspend our current full year outlook until the economy begins to recover and normalize from today's events. Thank you again for your time today. We look forward to updating everyone on our second quarter results in July. With that I'd like to ask the operator to open up the line for any questions. Operator?"
