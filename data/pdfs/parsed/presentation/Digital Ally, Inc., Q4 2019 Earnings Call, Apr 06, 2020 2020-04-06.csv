3,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,3,Operator,,,Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stan Ross.
4,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,4,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I've got with me Tom Heckman, the company's CFO. Tom will do a quick recap of last year's numbers and fourth quarter numbers. And we will probably move rather quickly on into visiting about what we still believe 2020 looks like in regards to our existing products and also touch on our most recent press release that we announced today concerning the disinfectant that we will now be marketing to our first responders as well."
5,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,5,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"So Tom, I'll let you do a little quick recap, and then we'll get into the forward-looking stuff."
6,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,6,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"All right. Thank you, Stan, and welcome, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. I do want to let you know that we have filed our Form 10-K with the SEC this morning. And it is a full recap of the year 2019 versus 2018, and I certainly refer you to that. I'm not going to go through that in any significant detail."
7,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,7,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"I'll try and hit some of the high points. And I know with the current environment and everything that's going on, 2019 seems like ancient history with what we're dealing with right now. So I won't spend a lot of time with it. We'll talk about what's happened recently, including in the first quarter here and where we sit today."
8,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,8,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"So anyway, with that in mind, I would tell you that 2019, on a bottom line, about $5 million better than the previous year. And that was primarily due to the patent litigation settlement that we entered into with WatchGuard, where gained $6 million in funding through that. Offset by a $3.3 million increase in our patent litigation liability, the fair value of that. So in essence, that contributed about $3 million, a little less than $3 million to our bottom line. So we had good improvement elsewhere."
9,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,9,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"If you look at the top line, really, I think it's more indicative of 2 factors. Number one, we're trying to move people more to a service plan and platform rather than a product sale, a hardware sale program. In that regard, our overall sales declined 15%, but our service and other income increased by 25%, not income, I mean, revenue. And it's clear why we're doing that. Our margins -- our gross margins on service hit 77% in 2019 versus 76% in 2018. So our overall plan seems to be working from that standpoint. We are shifting more sales to the service channel rather than the hardware sales."
10,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,10,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"And the second reason for that is we did introduce EVO-HD in the middle point of last year. And as expected, our customers took a pause to look at that and evaluate it. It is a revolutionary new platform that we're very proud of, but it has taken some time for our customers to review it, test it and adopt it. And in that regard, we did do a press release, I think, last week about a pretty nice order we got for EVOs. I would tell you also, the domestic order that we got for EVOs. I will tell you that we had a rather large international order in the hopper to ship in March of 2020. That was and is delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Countries and certainly foreign countries have their hands full with the coronavirus."
11,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,11,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"So I think the bottom line here is that we are seeing some very good traction. Customers are very receptive to the EVO-HD and the new platform and the connectivity of that platform. And I believe it will be the bellwether for years to come. With that in mind, it did hamper our hardware sales in 2019 as well."
12,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,12,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"So let's talk about a few other things that have happened more recently. We did complete a $2.5 million underwritten public offering in March at $1.15 per share. Gross proceeds of roughly $3 million. We're very happy to get that done before the coronavirus epidemic really became problematic in the capital market. So we got that done in early March, and we're glad we did that."
13,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,13,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Our first quarter revenues, I will say, are very similar to last year, which I think, given the situation, most people would be pretty happy with that. But for -- I would -- thinking for myself and I think even Stan, we're both very disappointed in that. We started the year, January, February with double-digit increases over prior year revenues. We were seeing good traction. The EVO is starting to hit a little bit. And in March, we had several large international orders as well as domestic orders that were set to go out. We even had them on pallets ready to ship at one time. That got delayed because of the impact of the coronavirus. So although first quarter is going to be very similar to last year, we're disappointed in that we did not get the opportunity to ship orders that should have been shipped, given normal times rather than what we're currently experiencing."
14,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,14,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"So also, I would tell you that the Axon litigation, we did a press release that announced the oral arguments were supposed to happen today. And because of the coronavirus thing and other factors, the appellate court issued a order that they were not going to do oral arguments that they were going to rule upon the briefs as submitted by the 2 party. Stan and I really looking through the tea leaves, and it's only our judgment is we believe that's good news, but we don't know until they actually issue. And quite frankly, we don't know when they're going to issue with what's going on, when they're going to meet and go over the briefs and determine an outcome for that appellate hearing so."
15,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,15,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. But it's my understanding, Tom, that the briefs will be submitted today. So that's still taking place. In talking to our litigation team, we believe that maybe because of the fact that they're not now going actually move a little quicker. So we still think, at least from what we're hearing, unless there's -- they shut -- completely shut the courts down and don't allow them to make any kind of rulings, that we should see something, I would say, within the next 45 days. So it could be rather quickly as they're not having people walking through in and out of the courtroom. They could be sitting around the table right now, and all parties looking at it and saying what your thoughts on it so. But we do think that the fact that they did not -- and they did elect to go ahead and instead of postponing it, went ahead and did a what do you want to say just said, ""Hey, guys, you don't need to come here. We've got enough or believe that our position, we can get to a position to rule on it by just using the briefs."" We look upon that as somewhat favorable. We would have thought that if, for some reason, they weren't interested in hearing our side of it, as we're the ones that actually filed it, they would at least postpone and given us our day in court. So we're hopeful that it will continue to move forward, and we'll get something on that in the next 45 days."
16,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,16,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Thank you, Stan. And I just got a couple of other things I'll mention. We were deficient with the NASDAQ listing requirements, continued listing requirements. We filed several 8-Ks and releases that described that event. Stan and I met with the NASDAQ Board in February and presented our compliance plan, which we're happy to announce or I think we have announced already that the NASDAQ was very receptive and approved our plan. And gave us until June 30, 2020, to achieve that plan."
17,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,17,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Now with the current environment, we kind of expect that, that will be delayed because of everything that's going on with the coronavirus, and I know there's a lot more NASDAQ companies with deficiency issues as well as us that the NASDAQ is dealing with. So I hope that, that gets delayed, but I don't know that it will get delayed. And we don't -- and we will certainly appraise the market when and if we hear from the NASDAQ on the exact date, if that's going to be delayed at all."
18,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,18,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"I would tell you from a coronavirus perspective, we have made some changes in our operating plans, including having people work from home. And I think you guys have seen -- hopefully, you've seen the press release this morning. We've taken on a new line of products to help our first responders deal with the coronavirus onset to disinfect cars, any kind of surface, jails, tables, whatever it is, the product that I'm sure you guys will want to know more about has been around for a number of years. We have a distributorship for that, and we're going to hit our customer base with an e-mail blast today, and we expect and we hope that we'll get a very good response from that because this is an exciting product. It's nontoxic, and it's approved by the EPA to fight the coronavirus as well as a number of other contaminants and bacteria and viruses, including HIV, MRSA, I can't remember, C. diff, Salmonella."
19,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,19,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"There's a ton of them. If you go to our website, and can bear with us that it's getting more and more information put on it, virtually every hour. But you could get on there and get a pretty good understanding, and there's some links that take you to the -- I think it's the FDA and the EPA, the appropriate government sites to give you a little more understanding of what it's capable of doing. And just touching on it, Tom, since we're on it right now is the product itself, we've been knowledgeable about it and setter and did a little bit of preliminary, I would say, marketing and talking to a few of our key customers, if they would have a level of interest in the product. And we were overwhelmed with those that clearly say they have an interest. And in talking to our team, and we realized that this is going to be a situation for sanitation, the cleanliness, on and on, that is going to be looked at, scrutinized. Even our government has said that they're concerned about if we get past these next month or so that still need to be on high alert on cleanliness and stuff as we go into the flu season later this year, that it could come back around. And until we really get a vaccine for it, it's going to be with us."
20,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,20,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"So with the thousands of departments they currently buy from us that could utilize it, the amount of taxi cabs, just -- there are multiple customers that we have and have all shown very strong levels of interest in the product. I would be -- we just literally launched it today and told our sales team, and we do have our e-mail blast going out here in a few hours. But just really surprised by the amount of interest and relationship with the bottling company or, let's say, the master distributor that we work very closely with and have had a relationship with for some time. So we are excited about it. We think that this is a area that really could have an impact in our 2020 numbers. And we will update you all in the form of a press release as we see how things play out for, let's just say, the month of April. We'll give you an update and let you know how many gallons or thousands of gallons or whatever the magic number may be, we'll let you know. But we are very excited about this product."
21,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,21,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And I would just add a couple of comments and then turn it back to Stan to -- I'm sure you guys have many comments and questions about where we're headed. But we're looking at this as a new channel for Digital Ally to help first responders, not only first responders, but it really fits in well with the rest of our businesses. We have the event solutions business, the taxi cab, the cruise ships."
22,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,22,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,Ambulances.
23,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,23,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Ambulances. So it really fits like a glove with our current customer list. And obviously, we're going to exploit that. But we believe it's going to bring in new channels as well and give us avenues to also sell them hardware and services surrounding our recording products. So anyway, we're excited about it. We're looking for other ones, too. I mean there's other products that we're looking at that we may take on in a similar category. But look for us to try and improve revenues through other channels as well."
24,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,24,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"So with that, I'll turn it back to Stan, and I'm sure you guys have more questions for us."
25,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",Presentation,25,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And Tom, as everybody should know that's on the call that we also have been making quite a bit of headway in regards to our new breathalyzer that has our patent associated with it, that continues to come along real nicely in the development, and we still anticipate being able to have that out later this year. So yes, we will continue to look at mainly different products. I don't know if I want to say channels, different products that can really easily fit into the existing distribution channels that we have. And then that will have a ripple effect leading into other areas. Obviously, with our relationship and partnerships with a lot of the entities from football to NASCAR, those are avenues that will continue to -- we'll be able to expand on with some of our products. And we also will be actually bringing in sub distributors in regards to a couple of our products that have their own channels and network in place too. So I'm excited about what we have ahead of us and really would just like to see, like all of us, things get back to normalcy so that we can all be shaking hands again at some point in time and being able to talk business across from the table versus over the phone. So anyways, we'll go ahead and open this up for the Q&A side of our call."
