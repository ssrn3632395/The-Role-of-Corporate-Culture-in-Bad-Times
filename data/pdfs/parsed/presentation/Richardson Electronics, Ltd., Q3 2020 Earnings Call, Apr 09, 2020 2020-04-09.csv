12,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,12,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Operating expenses decreased to $12.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $13.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from lower severance, legal and professional services expenses partially offset by higher research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare as we invest in additional CT X-ray tube types."
13,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,13,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"As I mentioned, the company reported an operating income of $11,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to an operating loss of $0.8 million in the third quarter of last year. This is a result of the improved gross margin and lower operating expenses."
14,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,14,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Other income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, including interest income and foreign exchange, was $0.1 million compared to other income of less than $0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The income tax provision of $0.2 million for the quarter reflected a provision for foreign income taxes, which was lower than in the prior year's third quarter and the U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss. Although there is no tax benefit shown on our financial statements, from U.S. net operating losses, we can use our net operating losses to offset any cash tax liability reported in our U.S. federal income tax return. The amount of federal NOLs is $15.4 million. Overall, we had a net loss of $0.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019."

Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Sales for Richardson Healthcare of $7 million were the same as last year. Gross margin increased to 32.3% from 31.5%, primarily reflecting favorable product mix in Richardson Healthcare and improved manufacturing performance for both PMT and Healthcare."
17,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,17,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Operating expenses were $38.7 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which represented a decrease of $0.9 million from the first 9 months of the last fiscal year. The decrease was due to lower severance, legal and professional services expenses partially offset by higher research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare."
18,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,18,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Operating loss for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2020 was $0.4 million, the same as for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2019.

20,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,20,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"We continue to closely manage our cash position. Cash and investments at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were $43.9 million compared to $46.1 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and $49.4 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

24,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,24,Robert J. Ben,"Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Now I will turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss the results for our Power & Microwave Technologies group."
25,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,25,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. PMT sales in third quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $28.9 million versus $29.7 million in Q3 FY '19. Our gross margin improved in the quarter to 32.8% versus 31.6% in the prior year, and we reduced our SG&A in the quarter. Q3 sales when compared to prior year were mainly impacted by the year-over-year sales decline in our legacy Tube business, an issue related to COVID-19 in China. However, this decline was partially offset by continued strong growth and our new technology partners supporting the RF and power markets and increased sales with our semiconductor wafer fab customers."
26,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,26,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Another positive trend was our book-to-bill. BTB was 1.13x and was driven by strong bookings from our wafer fab customers, C tube product lines and our PMG business unit. Our bookings growth in our EDG business unit was based on continued engineering and logistic support of the wafer fab market and global infrastructure to support our OEM and MRO customers. The growth in PMG bookings was due to our new technology partners' products, our demand creation model, our numerous design wins in high-growth markets and a unique global business model. We continue to improve our global go-to-market strategy by investing in key business development resources to greatly improve and increase our customer contact in a more efficient manner."
27,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,27,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"As the market conditions dictate, we continue to manage our SG&A and invest in key growth areas. We also continue to implement strategies to improve our efficiencies and increase our customer contact."
28,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,28,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,These actions allow us to generate more opportunities in growing markets using our existing global infrastructure and head count. This will have a positive impact on our performance for the balance of the year and into the future.
29,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,29,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Our revenue growth with our new technologies is being supported by key partners, such as Qorvo, MACOM, Anokiwave, United Silicon, ISM and Fuji Semiconductor. Our core legacy business continues to be greatly supported by the key tube manufacturers in the industry, such as CPI, Thales, NJRC and Photonis."
30,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,30,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Of course, COVID-19 is having a net effect on Q4. As of this date, there have not been any large pushouts or cancellations. We are in consistent communication with our suppliers and customers. We are very excited about the booking trends in both business units, however, we know that there will be an adjustment period at some point in which the customers will adjust their backlog as they get more data on the global status of COVID-19."
31,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,31,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"It is interesting, though, as I have talked to all of you about 5G opportunities for the past few years and spent my career rolling out 3G, 4G and now 5G infrastructure to increase the ability to be mobile and communicate and manage data throughout the world. With there being a shortage of so many items with this pandemic, what we are not short on is bandwidth in wireless communications."
32,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,32,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Wireless infrastructure was not put in over the years for this event. However, I started to think what we'd be dealing with if everyone in the world immediately worked from their home and manage their business and communicate without the implementation of 3G, 4G and now 5G infrastructure. We were able to take our entire organization on a global basis and get them started to work from the safety of their homes within hours after we implemented the stay-home policy. When we get through this, I believe there will be a major expedite of getting 5G capabilities throughout the world, and Richardson is very well positioned to support it. I can't stress enough the value of Richardson Electronics unparalleled capability and global go-to-market strategy that is unique to the power and RF and microwave industries. Our world-leading position in the manufacturing and distribution of electronic devices supports the legacy equipment as well as new equipment where solid-state cannot replace tubes. The combination of these 2 niche strategies separates us from our competition and has proven successful. Once this virus is controlled, we feel we are definitely in the right markets and have the right strategy to support the opportunities as they arise."
33,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,33,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"With that, I'll turn it over to Wendy Diddell in Richardson Healthcare."
34,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,34,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Revenues generated from CT in the third quarter of FY '20 increased 135% over last year's third quarter. While we don't report the actual number of tubes sold or installed, we are happy to note that the number of ALTA tubes sold during the quarter increased over prior year and over our most recent second quarter. Our average selling price for the ALTA750 declined slightly during the quarter as we pushed customers to try our tube over new and used OEM tube. While we were happy with the increase, we all agree more would be better. Our longest-life tube is now nearing 700 days."
35,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,35,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Total healthcare sales in the third quarter were below prior year due primarily to the continuing significant decline in equipment sales. This is the result of ongoing economic issues throughout Latin and South America. Nearly all of our customers in these regions remain under financial pressure. This market will come back, and we'll be ready to support it when it does. In the interim, we speak regularly to all of our customers throughout the region and help them with critical parts supply and technical support."
36,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,36,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Gross margin in the third quarter was 38.3% of sales, a fantastic improvement over 26.2% in Q3 last year. The improvement is due to product mix as well as improvements in manufacturing."
37,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,37,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Producing CT tubes is a very difficult business. Companies who have been doing this for decades are constantly challenged by the operational demands placed on the product. Manufacturing tubes requires extreme and continual high levels of equipment and personnel performance. There is very little margin for error. With our team of experienced engineers and production technicians, the majority of whom came from leading CT tube manufacturers, we are confident we will continue to find solutions to improve our internal yields and increase the performance of our tubes. This, along with putting additional tube types into production, will help drive margins up in the future."
38,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,38,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Throughout the quarter, we applied a full-court press to generate sales of the ALTA750. We reached out to every former, current and potential tube customers, including service providers and end users. We confirmed CT systems under contract and reminded everyone of the benefits of using our tube. Now we wait for a tube to fill on a scanner that's not covered under a service contract. We are prepared and will continue to stay in front of our customers."
39,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,39,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Now fast forward several weeks, and we are faced with an unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has brought much of our proactive selling efforts to a halt. Face-to-face meetings have been put on hold, and most hospital personnel are not taking sales calls. However, this is a short-term issue. We've all read and are questioning if tube sales will increase with the use of CT scans to help diagnose the virus. In fact, right now, the opposite may be true. Many of our third-party service providers are telling us that they have seen a drop in service call volume in recent weeks. That's because hospitals have canceled all noncritical surgeries and they're closing nonessential medical facilities so that all resources are ready and available for coronavirus patients. This, too, is expected to be short-term with a spike in demand when COVID-19 is under control. Again, we are ready with parts and tubes."
40,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,40,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Throughout this period, we are still offering 24/7 technical support and manning our product helpline. We are spending regular e-mail reminders to everyone in our database so they know where to turn when a part or tube is needed. We are checking in with our service partners and offering assistance. So far, our carriers are operating business as usual, and we have a team of people making sure our parts are ready to ship, no matter what time of the day or night they are needed. Our best wishes go out to those fighting on the front lines of the pandemic. We thank them for their service and for putting themselves at risk to take care of others."
41,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,41,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"As an essential business, our engineering and production teams continue with development and manufacturing. They're either working remote or in the plant under social distancing guidelines. We are working closely with our suppliers. Those that initially close due to shelter-in-place directives have reopened to support essential businesses, such as ours. We have had some prototype delays due to coronavirus-related personnel issues outside of Richardson Healthcare. We anticipate this will push testing of the G tube to early fall, with our launch planned for late January 2021. So just a short delay. Our efforts to develop a process for repairing a third tube are also underway, and we are exploring ways to expedite release. In both cases, it is more important to get the tubes right than to launch too early."
42,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,42,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, we continue to work with regulatory bodies in other countries, including China, Korea and Russia as well as smaller countries, such as the Ukraine. We are also working to ensure that we have both U.S. and EU approvals for the G tube at the time of launch. We appreciate your ongoing support as well as your patience."
43,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,43,Gregory J. Peloquin,Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group,EXECUTIVES,"At this point, I will turn the call over to Jens Ruppert to discuss third quarter results for Canvys."
44,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,44,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Canvys, which includes the engineering, manufacture and sale of custom displays to original equipment manufacturers in industrial and medical markets, delivered strong performance with sales of $7.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of 3.5% over the same period last year. The revenue increase for the quarter was related to increased customer demand in North America."
45,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,45,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.8% during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the same as during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Q3 fiscal 2020 was another strong quarter for Canvys with a book-to-bill of 1.57x. We were able to increase our backlog again to an all-time high in recent history. Our backlog consists of purchase orders that typically ship over 1 or more years. Customers issue call off orders that vary quarter-to-quarter based on customer demand, component availability and other factors. The healthy backlog position, along with the number of projects that are currently in the engineering stage, position us well for continued growth."
46,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,46,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"During the quarter, we received several new orders from both existing and first-time medical OEM customers. Applications where our displays are used are numerous. Some of these include cryolipolysis systems that break down fat cells by cooling off body fat; refractive surgery a laser system for therapeutic and refractive applications of cutting-edge corneal surgery; patient monitoring where our monitors are installed at patient beds or remote locations, such as central nurse stations; medical device control, capturing high-resolution images and live video from up to 2 surgical imaging devices; radiotherapy where highly customized displays are used to monitor the patients during the radiation treatment; diagnostic monochrome displays that are DICOM compliant; high-definition displays used for endoscopy applications; human-machine interface for electrosurgical devices, electrosurgery is application of high-frequency alternating polarity electrical current through biological tissue as a means to cut and coagulate tissue precisely and with limited blood loss; and dental treatment centers where patients can review radiographic images or live video from an intraoral camera or other video feeds, such as educational or videos or promotion."
47,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,47,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"In the nonmedical space, we received orders for various displays and all-in-one products. Applications include this place with an embedded RFID reader and USB hub used as human-machine interfaces for surface inspection machines, human-machine interfaces for ticketing machines in public transportation sectors, and tailor prompter, talent monitors and clocks used in the broadcast market for popular news stations around the world."
48,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,48,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"We continue to look for new customers through trade shows, online marketing, referrals and cold calling. The LCD and flat-panel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak as China-based manufacturers have major production lines in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. The epidemic has disrupted production across almost all information and communication technology sectors leading many firms without components and material supplies. The chip resistor inventory, for example, has reached a 10-year low level. Our lead times have been impacted as well, and we don't see them coming back to normal soon."
49,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,49,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"The impact of the coronavirus outbreak is expected to affect it all up to 20% in the global flat panel output. It is difficult to quantify the impact specifically to our business at this time. We do expect some customer pushouts. While several of our customers are considered essential businesses, like we are, they're operating on a reduced output basis for now. Many others are closed. Considering all the new programs we are working on with existing as well as new customers. I'm optimistic that we will continue growing our business once we are past the effect of the coronavirus."
50,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,50,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"We have proven ourselves to be a highly reliable, versatile technology company with the ability to meet a diverse number of display requirements as well as being in compliance with the upcoming of MDR. We offer our key customers safety stock options, enabling them to react quickly on unexpected increased demands and helping bridge interruptions in the supply chain, such as we are seeing with the coronavirus."
