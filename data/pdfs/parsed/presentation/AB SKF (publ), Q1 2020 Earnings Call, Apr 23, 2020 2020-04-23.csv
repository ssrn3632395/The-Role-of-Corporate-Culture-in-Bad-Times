Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this presentation of our fourth (sic) [ first ] quarter results. We have delivered another very strong set of results despite falling demand connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our cash flow generation is strong, and we have continued to invest in innovation, optimize our operations and reduce costs. Sales were impacted across most regions by both government and post closures as well as by lower underlying demand. Net sales fell organically by almost 9% to SEK 20.1 billion. Sales were 10% lower in Asia, 9% lower in Europe, 12% lower in North America, and almost 4% higher in Latin America. Despite this development, the adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was strong at 12.8%, in -- exactly in line with last year with an adjusted operating profit of SEK 2.572 billion. Cash flow was also strong with almost SEK 2 billion."

Sales were significantly lower in Europe, North America and Asia and relatively unchanged in Latin America."
8,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,8,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If we turn to the next page.

12,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,12,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If we turn to the next page. Well, precautionary measures by authorities and lower customer demand is impacting many of the regions and industries in which we operate. First and foremost, focus is always on creating a safe working environment. For us, this means implementing new ways of working in some areas. In this [indiscernible], you see that we are running here in our test center for large-size bearings in Frankfurt, we do it remotely, no people on site. We have adjusted our production output at many of our sites. We were closed for about 1 week longer than normal after the Chinese New Year. But thanks to a lot of the hard work from our team in China, we were able to reopen on February 10."
13,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,13,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We've also seen closed sites in India, Italy, following decisions by authorities and closures of some of our automotive plants due to the fact that many of our customers have been closed. During the end of March, we experienced a sharp drop in sales of 25% compared to last year. This is a high level of uncertainty regarding -- there is a high level of uncertainty regarding future demand. We're planning for different scenarios, of course, and we are taking appropriate actions to make sure that SKF emerges from this situation as an even stronger company."
14,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,14,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Here, we see a picture from the factory in Tudela, Spain, which recently became our second completely CO2-neutral manufacturing sites. Together with the factory in Steyr, Austria, the 2 factories have reduced their combined annual CO2 emissions by some 22,000 tonnes. And here, you can see the solar panels on the factory roof."
15,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,15,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If we turn to the next page. Increasing demands on planned performance puts increasing pressure on machinery. To avoid unnecessary downtime, equipment needs to be monitored more often. As less time and resources are available for manual workaround, automation is crucial. Now there's a new way to achieve reliable rotation and a new way to purchase it from SKF. SKF Enlight collection IMx-1 sensors allow you to build an automated machine monitoring system powered by cloud-based IoT solutions and AI-driven analytics. It is wireless, easily scalable and connected to SKF Rotating Equipment Performance centers. If you just call, anybody listening, to SKF, it will be delivered as a kit with remote instructions how to install it."
16,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,16,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With these words, I'll leave the word back to you, Patrik."
17,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,17,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"No, sorry. Now it's you."
18,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,18,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Alrik. Good. And if we turn to the next page, please. And starting off with net sales. So net sales decreased by 5.5% in the quarter. Organic net sales were 8.6% lower than last year. As Alrik mentioned, for industrial, we saw a decline in organic sales by 6.7%, and automotive declined 13.2% in the quarter. The currency effect on sales was positive in the quarter by 3% with the largest effect, as usual, coming from the dollar to euro and renminbi."
19,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,19,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We turn to the next page, please. We've seen a significant slowdown in growth since the peak back in Q2 2018. During this time, we've continued to invest, invested in innovation, in competitiveness and also adapting our operations to a lower growth scenario and reducing our cost base. So looking at the operating profit development, we've been quite successful in this process."
20,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,20,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In the first quarter, we delivered an adjusted operating profit of SEK 2.6 billion, which is actually on par with last year despite the decline in growth."
21,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,21,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We turn to the next page, please. So taking you through the operating profit bridge for the quarter. Firstly, we had a negative small, very small effect from divested acquired companies of SEK 21 million."
22,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,22,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The currency impact was a positive SEK 146 million compared to last year. And then in terms of our operational performance, it was SEK 273 million lower year-on-year. Organic sales and manufacturing volumes were SEK 575 million lower and then we had a negative effect from lower sales and production volumes. But on the other hand, both price and mix were positive in the quarter. Cost development was good. We continue to see higher realized cost savings than cost increases, resulting in a positive net contribution to operating profit in the quarter of SEK 302 million compared to last year."
23,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,23,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If I take the opportunity to provide some perspective on the bridge for Q2. So from M&A, we expect no material impact from price mix. We do continue to expect to see some positive impact and then what comes to cost development in Q2, we do expect to continue to offset cost inflation with cost savings."
24,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,24,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If we then move to the next page, please. Here you see the performance by customer group in the quarter. And if we start off with industrial, our organic net sales in industrial decreased by 6.7%. In North America, sales were significantly lower. Sales in Europe and Asia were lower, while then sales were slightly higher in Latin America. For Industrial, the adjusted operating margin was 15.5%. So pretty much the same level as last year when it was 15.8%. Good cost performance contributed positively to the result, while lower sales and production volumes had a negative effect in the quarter."
25,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,25,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If we then spend a minute on Automotive. Organic sales in Automotive declined by 13.2% in the first quarter with significantly lower sales volumes in North America, Europe and Asia, while sales in Latin America for Automotive were relatively unchanged. The automotive business had an adjusted operating margin of 5.7%, which is again in line with last year's 5.6%. The result was negatively impacted by lower sales and production volume, offset by good cost performance."
26,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,26,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"If we turn to the next page, please, and talk about cash flow. We are maintaining a strong cash flow trend despite having increased our investments in manufacturing significantly over the couple of last years. Cash flow in Q1, excluding M&A, financing activities was, as Alrik said, almost SEK 2 billion. So SEK 1,930 million compared to SEK 830 million last year. The increase in cash flow is mainly due to reduced working capital. The cash flow, excluding financing activities for the last 12 months, was SEK 6.8 billion."
27,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,27,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We turn to the next page, please. So net working capital as a percentage of sales was 29.5% at the end of the first quarter, which was 0.5 percentage points lower than in the first quarter last year."
28,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,28,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And moving on, next page, please. We do have a strong balance sheet. The net debt-to-equity ratio continued to improve and was 57.6% at the end of the quarter. The net debt-to-equity ratio, excluding leasing and pensions, was 7.5%. We saw an increase of SEK 1.5 billion in provisions for post-employment benefits, so pensions, in the first quarter, and this was mainly due to actuarial losses on planned assets and currency effects. So the losses were primarily related to the asset values decreasing in line with market."
29,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,29,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,SKF's financial liquidity is strong. We have about SEK 16 billion in cash and committed but unused credit facilities.
30,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,30,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And then if we move on to the next page, please. What comes to demand outlook, we are, of course, impacted by the fact that the industries and regions in which we operate are being impacted initiatives by authorities, and by SKF's customers related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus. As a result of this, the significant level of uncertainty, it's not feasible to provide a reliable demand guidance for the second quarter."
31,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,31,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turn to next slide, please. And then finally, some additional guidance for the second quarter. We expect finance net to be about SEK 250 million negative including IFRS-16 effects. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of around 29%. And as you know, over the last 3 years, we have consistently increased our investments. And we have and are accelerating our investments in property, plant and equipment. And in 2020, we expect to see additions to plant and property of around SEK 3.3 billion."
32,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,32,Niclas Rosenlew,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And with that, I give the word back to you, Alrik."
33,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,33,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you very much, Niclas. And apologize for forgetting you. I'll never do that again."
34,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,34,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, if we summarize, I think we can all be proud of a very strong quarter where we delivered a good strong performance continuously and despite lower sales. It is, of course, a result, I think, of hard work for a long time and understanding early that something was going to happen, so we could find new ways of working and focus very hard on cost reduction at the same time as closing -- keeping close contact with customers. We delivered a stable operating margin as we have stated, and we have more than offset the cost inflation by savings."
35,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,35,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With our strong financial position, we are continuing to invest in our manufacturing. We're also continuing to invest in technologies that enable our fee-based offering, machine learning, data analytics and, of course, condition monitoring using cloud and edge computing technologies."
36,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,36,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Looking into Q2, there's a high level of demand uncertainty, as I think everybody can understand. And we are taking every step to make sure that SKF emerges stronger than ever when markets eventually recover."
37,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,37,Alrik Danielson,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With this, I thank you for listening into the presentation, and I hand over to Patrik."
38,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,38,Patrik Stenberg,Director of Group Investor Relations & Competitive Intelligence and Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you. And then with that, we are ready to take your questions. And again, might I remind you to clearly state your name and also limit yourselves to 2 questions."
39,"AB SKF (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",Presentation,39,Patrik Stenberg,Director of Group Investor Relations & Competitive Intelligence and Head of Investor Relations,EXECUTIVES,"After that, and if we have time, you're more than welcome to get back in line. Operator, please."
