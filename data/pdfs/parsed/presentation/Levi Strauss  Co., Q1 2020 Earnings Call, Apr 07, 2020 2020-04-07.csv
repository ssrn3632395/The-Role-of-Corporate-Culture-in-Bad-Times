In particular, at this time, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the company's business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.

7,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,7,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Aida. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q1 earnings call, which will be unlike most typical quarterly earnings calls, as while we will cover Q1 results, we'll focus more on updating you on where we are with the crisis at hand and how we are navigating the uncertainty that we're all facing. What is happening in the world around us is not just a human tragedy, but will likely result in a significant global economic tragedy. The biggest challenge we're all dealing with right now is uncertainty. How long will this continue? How deep of an economic crisis does the pandemic create? How will the consumer respond when the crisis abates? And ultimately, what is the shape, size and scope of the apparel sector when it's over? Frankly, trying to forecast this is nearly impossible. No one can control the virus or even the economic fallout, but we can control how we react to the crisis. I am very optimistic about our prospects for the future, both navigating through the crisis in the short to medium term and in the long term recovery, and I believe we are well positioned, if not better positioned than most companies, in our industry."
8,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,8,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We had a great first quarter. Our business was humming coming into the crisis, again, reaffirming the robust strategies that we are executing and the momentum we had prior to the crisis erupting globally. But beyond the strength of our business and the underlying momentum, here is why I'm confident that we will emerge stronger on the other side. We have one of the world's most iconic, most loved brands in Levi's, and consumers will come back to brands that they love and trust. We haven't gone dark either. We're investing in strengthening our bond with our fans during these moments of isolation. We have a strong balance sheet and $1.8 billion of liquidity. We have an experienced management team that has a track record of making tough choices to cut costs, just as we did back in 2013, 2014. We've aggressively cut costs before, and we're on it now. Inventories are down and a significant majority of our inventory is core replenishment, which can be carried over to future seasons. We're focused on innovation. F.L.X. will be an advantage during this time as we'll be able to bring newness when stores reopen, regardless of when that is. And the innovation over the last month, leveraging digital tools throughout this organization, has been awesome."
9,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,9,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our strategy to diversify the business, which we've been executing now for years, makes us less vulnerable to the shocks that may be felt in some countries and channels. Our DTC business is now more than 40% of our total business, up from under 30% 5 years ago. Our e-commerce business has more than doubled in the last 5 years and is our fastest-growing business. Finally, we have something nobody else in this industry can claim, a company history of 167 years. We've been through other crises, some perhaps even more existential than what we're currently facing. We've seen it all, the Great Depression, 2 World Wars, earthquakes, fires and, yes, even the 1918 flu pandemic. Not only did we pull-through all of these, we use crisis to galvanize the path forward, and we will do it again. I also believe that crisis presents opportunities, and we will be ready to act on those that make good strategic sense, whether that's taking back underperforming franchise businesses or upgrading real estate locations because of other retailer bankruptcies or finding great talent in a decimated job market. The crisis gives us an opportunity to not just renew the business, but to reset it for the future."
10,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,10,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Net, we are not managing through the crisis by playing defense. We will play to our strengths, leveraging the strength of the brand, our connection with our fans and the digital capabilities and omnichannel capabilities that we've invested in over the last few years. At the same time, we don't have our head in the sand. We will also be aggressive on cost takeout in light of the impact that the crisis will have on revenue and our structural economics, but we will be deliberate and thoughtful about how we do this, so we don't cut core capabilities and the things that have created our success over the last few years."
11,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,11,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Let me give you a little more color on a few of these areas. First, we are very focused on engaging with our fans during their isolation, cultivating a deeper love for the Levi's brand. Just when the music festival season was supposed to start, all festivals have been canceled or postponed. To help fill the void, we launched a month-long virtual music festival with our Instagram Live 5:01 concert series. Each week night at 5:01 PM, artists such as Snoop Dogg and Brett Young are performing live in their Levi's, connecting this series has been so extremely positive, and we're finding more users are viewing these live sessions every day. This is something that is authentic. Truly something only Levi's could do. We're also replicating digital strategies that worked in China during and after their lockdown by featuring do-it-yourself content on our website that inspires our fans to customize their Levi's products at home."
12,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,12,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Second, we're pivoting our marketing approach in response to the current environment. For example, our recently launched Super Mario collaboration with Nintendo is flying off the shelves in China, and it's also resonating in our e-commerce sites in Europe because we built excitement and demand through social media campaigns. The Super Mario collection will be dropping in the U.S. later this week. People are looking to connect these days, and Super Mario puts a smile on everyone's face."
13,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,13,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Third, as you know, we recently launched the Levi's brand mobile app, and we're building loyalty with fans around the world, giving them another way to engage with the brand and another option for them to shop in whatever format they prefer. We've seen early success with strong consumer acquisition and enrollment rates and monthly engagement with exclusive product offerings, like the recent launch of our authorized vintage collection, which has been selling through very well. We will continue to scale and ramp our loyalty program and the app throughout this year."
14,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,14,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The culture of innovation deeply embedded at LS&Co. is helping us evolve how we're working internally as a team and with our customers during this crisis. For example, we've accelerated the rollout of new technology we developed in our Eureka Innovation Lab, photorealistic 3D renderings of denim garments and samples. This allows us to digitize the sampling process, enabling us to sell to merchants from images rather than requiring physical samples. We leveraged this technology recently in our most recent line assortment meeting. Normally, this meeting brings around 100 merchants and marketers to our San Francisco headquarters from around the world, and is followed by cascading meetings over multiple weeks as they engage with their regional and local counterparts. By leveraging this digital technology to hold the meeting virtually, we were able to engage everyone simultaneously and complete this process in one meeting, taking weeks out of our go-to-market cycle. The feedback was that this may have been the best assortment meeting ever, and we may never go back to live meetings. This technology and others like it will drive efficiency, speed to market and reduce waste, while improving our operations through and beyond the crisis."
15,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,15,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, as we navigate this time of crisis, we will continue to be guided by our values and long-standing commitment to profits through principles. Supporting our communities through tough challenges is nothing new to LS&Co. We have a legacy of leadership and of doing the right thing, and we're taking steps to fulfill that responsibility again. Our response to the COVID-19 impact will evolve as the crisis continues to play out. But to start with, we've announced a $3 million philanthropic program in partnership with the Levi Strauss Foundation, and we're working with the foundation to launch a 3:1 matching campaign for our employees' donations to community groups, stepping up to meet local needs and organizations supporting COVID-19 efforts, from ensuring out-of-school students still have access to meals, to delivering needed supplies to homebound senior citizens. Additionally, the Red Tab Foundation, which supports our employees and retirees with short-term grants to help them get through trying times, is expanding its efforts."
16,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,16,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Harmit will review the aggressive cost actions we're taking in light of this situation, but I want to cover the compensation and furlough-related announcements we're making today. Our Board members will forego their cash compensation, and we're announcing broad salary cuts for executives and leaders across the organization, including 50% from me. And effective April 13, we're furloughing all U.S. hourly retail employees and our wholesale merchandise coordinators."
17,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,17,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In closing, I will say again, while this will be a challenging time with significant uncertainty, we will be laser-focused on what's within our control to mitigate the impact to the degree possible as the world grapples with the virus and the economic fallout."
18,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,18,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We have many strengths on our side that I'm confident will bring us through the current environment: an iconic and beloved Levi's brand that has never been stronger; a solid balance sheet; a skilled, dedicated and courageous leadership team that will take aggressive action on costs; a culture of innovation and strategies that have transformed the business over the last 8 years that will help us chart our course through the coming months. We're taking swift and decisive action to ensure we remain a winner in our industry, and that we emerge from the storm as strong or stronger than going into it. The true character of a company is shown in a time of crisis, and as we have in the past, we will navigate this one by leveraging our strengths and seizing opportunities that will help us continue to thrive over the long term."
19,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,19,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn it over to Harmit to walk through the quarter in further detail. Harmit?
20,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,20,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon to all of you. I hope all of you, your families and loved ones are safe and healthy."
21,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,21,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The coronavirus is having far-reaching consequences around the world. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, let me share what we're doing now to respond to the challenge of COVID-19. Our focus is to balance cash preservation and profit protection. To that end, we're ensuring adequate cash flow and liquidity to navigate the choppy waters, including suspending our share buyback program and drawing down on our revolver. We are actively managing our supply chain and inventory flow, while leveraging our F.L.X. platform, while cutting our second half purchases and evaluating the most efficient way to reflow the small amount of seasonal items we have on hand, and soon, we will leverage existing capabilities, such as ship from store, to help manage inventory."
22,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,22,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"On cost management, we're substantially reducing advertising spend, and we are pulling SG&A levers available to us to cut costs in our business operation, such as the compensation cuts and furloughs Chip mentioned, freezing travel and headcount, significantly reducing variable expenses and negotiating with landlords to abate rent for the periods stores are closed. And we're reducing our capital spend on discretionary projects while reevaluating our store rollout plan. We're deferring our new distribution center in Europe and are now targeting a reduction in annual CapEx spend of up to 30%. We have closed the majority of our doors and those of our franchise partners to help slow the spread of the virus. Currently, about 70% of these doors are closed, 20% are fully open, and the balance are operating on reduced hours."
23,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,23,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"With respect to our first fiscal quarter of 2020, we are pleased to have delivered strong revenue growth, record-high gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our expectations. And if it weren't for the virus impact, we would have exceeded our adjusted EBIT expectations as well. The underlying momentum of our business continued to be very strong as well as our balance sheet and returns on invested capital. This is especially true in our global store fleet, where the 3-year average return on invested capital for the fleet is over 20%. As I walk you through additional detail on our first quarter results, my comments will reference constant currency comparisons on a year-over-year basis in U.S. dollars, unless I indicate otherwise. We published the details of our reported and constant currency results in today's press release so I will not repeat all of those here."
24,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,24,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"First quarter net revenue of $1.5 billion grew 6%. The estimated $20 million adverse impact in Asia of the coronavirus, combined with the unrest in Hong Kong, adversely impacted revenue growth by about 2 percentage points. Also note that we're lapping a strong first quarter 2019, which we grew 11% overall. Levi's men's volume was flat for the quarter. Our global 10 -- our top 10 global wholesale accounts collectively grew 5%, and our top 5 mature markets grew 3%, and within that, the U.S. was up 2% for the quarter. Our total women's business grew 12% in the first quarter on the back of high-teens growth last year. And our total tops business grew 5%. Direct-to-consumer grew 13% for the quarter. Revenue from our brick-and-mortar stores were up 14% globally, and global e-commerce was up 12%. Our total digital ecosystem grew double digits in Q1 and now comprises more than 15% of our total company's revenues, double the size of what it was just 3 years ago. Gross margin in the first quarter was 55.7%, a record high for the company. This represented an increase of 110 basis points on a reported basis, reflecting the benefit from the price increases we have taken as well as higher direct-to-consumer and international growth. Currency effects were negligible."
25,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,25,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Adjusted EBIT margin of 12.6% declined 180 basis points on a reported basis, entirely due to our plan to smooth advertising, higher charges from equity-settled awards and the timing of -- and the timing of related payroll taxes and approximately $10 million of lost adjusted EBIT from the coronavirus. The benefit of Black Friday revenues in the current year, which favorably impacted adjusted EBIT margin by about 70 basis points, was substantially offset by an estimated 50 basis points adverse impact from the coronavirus. Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter of $0.40 increased $0.02 on a reported basis compared to the same quarter in the prior year, slightly trailing 8% reported adjusted net income growth due to the increase in the company's share count resulting from our IPO. The estimated adverse impact of the coronavirus was $0.02. Currency unfavorably impacted adjusted net income by 2 percentage points, and adjusted EPS -- diluted EPS by $0.01."
26,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,26,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Now I'll share more detail on the first quarter results of our 3 regions in constant currency unless I state otherwise. Our results benefited from the calendar 2019 Black Friday week, which fell into our fiscal Q1 2020. As such, my regional comments today will focus on our business results adjusted for Black Friday. First quarter revenue in the Americas was flat when adjusted for Black Friday. We were really pleased with direct-to-consumer growth of 10% when adjusted for Black Friday, which was a combination of e- commerce growth, new brick-and-mortar stores in the region and same-store sales growth. The region's direct-to-consumer growth was offset primarily by a decline in U.S. wholesale, which was down 4% when adjusted for lower shipments to off price. This was a bit better than our expectations, especially as we were lapping high single-digit U.S. wholesale growth in the prior year. So on a 2-year stack, U.S. wholesale was positive. Our women's business continues to be the standout of U.S. wholesale, where it grew double digits this quarter."
27,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,27,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Europe's revenues were up 11% when adjusted for Black Friday, with growth, again, broad-based across channels, product segments and markets, and this was another quarter of lapping double-digit growth in the prior year. Direct-to-consumer revenues were up 9% adjusted for Black Friday, and wholesale revenues were up 12% on broad growth across markets and our customer base. The women's business posted another quarter of stellar growth, up 19% versus last year. And Levi's men's margins grew an impressive 10%, fueled by innovative new fits that resonated with consumers."
28,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,28,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In Asia, we estimated net revenues growth of 9% when adjusted for declines related to the coronavirus in the region and the political unrest in Hong Kong. Most of the region's markets grew. In China, prior to initiating store closures in response to the outbreak, our turnaround strategies were really gaining traction as double-digit revenue growth was eclipsing our internal expectations there. At the peak, nearly all our doors were closed, and although traffic remains well below prior year levels, we have now reopened all our company-operated stores in China, including our beacon store in Wuhan and all but 6 franchise doors. Though sales in China remained down to prior year, performance is sequentially improving each week, with our mainline store performance leading the charge, given the premium collection therein. And the company is in the process of taking back stores in Guangzhou and Chengdu from our prior franchise partners. Sales of our digital footprint in China, meaning our e-commerce sites and those operated by our partner, grew in March versus prior year, in particular driven by the strong growth in women's fashion fits. We leveraged our partnership with Tmall in the launch of our Super Mario collaboration, generating a ton of buzz and strong sell-through. And China's gross margins in March are higher than prior year, reflecting the favorable revenue shift towards the direct-to-consumer channel. We are encouraged by the progress we have seen in China, and we are using artificial intelligence and consumer insights to inform the playbook we'll use for other markets as they begin to recover."
29,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,29,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to balance sheet and cash flows. In dollar terms, total inventories at the end of the first quarter were down 7% compared to a year prior, continuing the positive inventory leverage trend. The composition of inventory was healthy with more than 70% being evergreen products that carry over well into future seasons. We have full visibility into our inventory across all stages of our supply chain, and we are working proactively, leveraging the strong relationships we have with our suppliers and customers around inventory levels, and have aggressively cut purchases and canceled orders for the second half of 2020. We are working with our suppliers to manage the flow of finished goods, in line with reduced demand in the short term. We are pulling all agility levers, including F.L.X., which is unique to LS&Co. to respond to changes in demand. We are working to extend the life cycle of the inventory we have on hand by carrying evergreen products forward into subsequent seasons, while infusing some new products in by carrying over fabric into products for subsequent seasons as much as possible. Even in a promotional environment, given the strength of our brand and inventory actions, we believe we can strike a good balance between gross margins and driving revenue."
30,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,30,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We have built a very healthy balance sheet and ended the quarter with access to nearly $1 billion in cash and another $820 million available under our credit facility, which is backed by strong high-quality financial institutions. And our next debt maturity comes in 2025. Cash is king in situations like this, so in the current environment, we felt it prudent to further augment our cash on hand and accordingly drew $300 million on our credit facility last week. This brings available cash to $1.2 billion while retaining availability of more than $0.5 billion on our revolver. With nearly $1.8 billion in total liquidity, we are better positioned than many to meet this challenge in the near term and emerge stronger when things normalize."
31,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,31,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We'll continue to deploy capital on a disciplined basis so as to fuel select long-term growth initiatives, although at a prudently lower level with fewer store openings than we announced on our last call. We are also sticking with quarterly dividend payment for now and have announced our second quarter dividend, which will again be $0.08 per share. This will bring first half dividends to approximately $64 million, an increase of 16% as compared to the first half of 2019. We will reassess dividends for the balance of the year as the situation evolves."
32,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,32,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Under our share buyback program, we've already repurchased a sufficient number of shares to offset our 2020 employee stock grant dilution estimate. Based on present circumstances, we do not anticipate the need to do further share buybacks for the remainder of the year and accordingly have suspended the program."
33,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,33,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And finally, a word on guidance. Given the unprecedented phenomenon of the coronavirus pandemic and the significant economic uncertainty it introduces, we have made the decision to withdraw guidance for the time being. Once we believe that we have sufficient visibility to reinstate guidance, we will do so."
34,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,34,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In summary, prior to when the coronavirus started to impact our results, our business trends and financial results were very strong. And even in the current situation, we remain a strong, purpose-driven company with powerful iconic brands and a confident outlook on our long-term growth opportunities once we emerge from the current crisis. We are geographically diversified, which will provide us the ability to capture best practices as well as sales as they come back in various markets. Our global diversified supply chain is agile enough to enable us to wisely manage inventory and to maximize our opportunity for working capital efficiency. We are being nimble in response to the developing situation. In addition to the actions we're taking now, we'll continue to drive lower costs as necessary to mitigate the profitability. To mitigate the -- okay. We're taking -- we're being nimble in response to the developing situation. In response to the actions we're taking now, we'll continue to drive lower costs as necessary to mitigate the profitability pressure from lower revenue. And we'll rightsize capital development to cover our highest priority, in order to preserve and drive the most efficient use of cash."
35,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,35,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our strong balance sheet provides us sufficient liquidity to carry us through this difficult time. We have a deep talent base around the world, and most importantly, we are one of the most iconic apparel brands loved by fans worldwide and increasingly by younger consumers who care about companies that do well and do good. We will focus on what we can control and expect to emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company. With that, we'll now open it up and take your questions."
