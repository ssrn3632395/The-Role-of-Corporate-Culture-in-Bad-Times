Our hearts go out to the people directly affected by COVID-19, and we are grateful for the essential workers we can to protect our employees and their families during this difficult time. We are grateful that all of our employees are able to work from home and that we are able to fully compensate the small number of employees who do not have roles outside of our physical offices."

9,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As a cloud-based technology company with a highly distributed workforce, the shift to work from home has been smooth for us. With cloud platforms and digital channels, it's been mostly business as usual. We continue to deliver the highest levels of performance, availability and security. Our technology, global infrastructure and operating model, along with our 24/7 customer support, enable our customers to work from home in a controlled, secure environment with their most sensitive data."
10,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"This ability to work from anywhere is becoming the new baseline. We believe that Workiva will be a key player in this broad-based shift to remote work, which will drive increased demand for our reporting and compliance platform for years to come."
11,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Workiva entered this global crisis from a position of financial strength. We believe we are in a stronger, more flexible financial position now than ever before, including nearly $500 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments."
12,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We are pleased with our first quarter 2020 financial results, which exceeded guidance for revenue and operating results. However, like many other companies, the month of March delivered some unprecedented challenges as we saw a number of customers and prospects delay software purchases."
13,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In March, we restricted nonessential business travel and we transitioned to all virtual sales meetings, even though our traditional sales process has been disrupted. In many cases, we are finding it easier to access people, and we are having engaging conversations with customers and prospects. In fact, most of the companies that delayed first quarter purchases are back in our pipeline. Stuart Miller, our CFO, will provide more details about our financial results later in the call."
14,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In times of rapid change, our commitment to each other and our customers remains the same.

15,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We continue to execute on our growth vectors, which include EMEA, Wdata and our platform solutions for integrated risk, global statutory reporting and the U.S. government. And we are continuing to hire people in the areas where we see the most potential for growth."
16,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Despite COVID-19, we remain confident that Europe will comprise 25% to 30% of our total revenue over time. We recently launched a new solution to help mid-sized companies comply with the European Single Electronic Format, commonly known as ESEF. Our new solution offers limited functionality, specifically for this market. Because this solution resides on the Workiva platform, customers are able to upgrade to our more comprehensive ESEF solution and leverage additional platform capabilities at any time."
17,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We also plan to continue extending the capabilities of our platform into additional industry verticals. Earlier this week, we announced that we will be working with utility, pipeline and other energy companies, many of which are existing customers, automate data integration and streamline reporting to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known as FERC. Last June, FERC adopted XBRL as its reporting standard. With our connected reporting platform and our leadership in XBRL, Workiva is ideally positioned to capture this market."
18,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In response to COVID-19, we shifted all marketing activities to virtual channels. As a result, our annual Amplify User Conference will be hosted virtually later this year. In March, our 2-day virtual event, Amplify GO, was attended by nearly 2,400 customers, prospects and partners and was our largest event to date."
19,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I want to thank our amazing employees for their ongoing dedication and commitment to delivering our platform and supporting our customers and partners around the world.
20,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Martin J. Vanderploeg,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With that, let me turn it over to Stuart Miller, our CFO."
21,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Marty. I'll comment on our financial position, review our business model and then explain at a high level why we beat our Q1 guidance. Next, I'll discuss Q1 2020 results versus Q1 last year and finish with forward guidance."
22,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We believe Workiva is well positioned financially to weather the storm from COVID-19. Indeed, we believe Workiva has never had a stronger or more flexible financial position than we do now. At March 31, Workiva had $496 million of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. The first maturity on our funded debt occurs in more than 6 years. Our debt obligations have no restrictive financial covenants."
23,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We believe our business model mitigates many of the challenges posed by COVID-19 for 6 reasons: first, demand for our solutions is relatively insulated from the business cycle. Software to assist larger enterprises with regulatory compliance and performance management is needed in both good times and bad."
24,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Second, our cloud-based platform is designed for team members to collaborate remotely, including those who work from home. On-premise systems cannot compete as well in this environment."
25,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Third, we enjoy high revenue retention rates because our customers love the design and functionality of our software and the high-quality of our customer service. Our platform saves time, reduces risk and eliminates many of the tedious aspects of financial and managerial reporting. We think our value proposition is compelling relative to alternatives and the markets we serve."
26,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Fourth, most of our customers pay us annually in advance for a subscription to our software platform. These contracts renew fairly evenly among the 4 quarters of the year. As a result, around 90% of the subscription revenue we recognize every quarter comes from deferred revenue."
27,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Fifth, no customer accounts for more than 1% of our revenue. Our 10 largest customers account for less than 5% of our revenue in the aggregate."
28,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Sixth, the sources of our revenue are diverse. But Note 8 to the financials in our 10-Q breaks out revenue contribution by industry of our customers."
29,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Shifting now to our financials. As always, I will talk about our results and guidance on a non-GAAP basis. Refer to our press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results and guidance."
30,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"I'll talk about how well we did against guidance first. We beat Q1 2020 revenue guidance at the midpoint by $2.75 million. Higher subscription revenue accounted for about 1/3 of the beat, while higher services revenue contributed the balance."
31,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We beat guidance on Q1 operating income by a relatively wide margin. I'd like to explain the $8 million positive operating income swing at a high level. The revenue beat I just mentioned accounted for 1/3 of the swing. Expenses accounted for the remaining 2/3 of the beat, as follows: travel and entertainment expenses were just over $1 million better than forecast due to COVID-19 travel restrictions; medical care expenses were almost $1 million better than forecast due to postponement of discretionary medical visits from COVID-19 restrictions and a higher percentage of our employees electing the high deductible medical insurance plan; sales commission expense was about $0.5 million better than forecast due primarily to a change in our sales commission structure; fees paid to recruiters, consultants and legal advisers were $0.5 million better than forecast. The remainder of the beat on Q1 operating income, just above $2 million, came from a hiring at a slower pace than forecast, some of which was related to COVID-19."
32,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Now turning to a comparison of Q1 2020 to Q1 last year. We generated total revenue in the first quarter of $85.8 million, an increase of 22.6% from Q1 2019. Breaking out revenue by reporting line item, subscription and support revenue was $68.4 million, up 21.8% from Q1 2019. New solutions, new logos and conversions to solution-based licensing helps drive strong revenue growth in Q1 2020. 56% of the increase in S&S revenue in Q1 came from existing customers. The balance of the increase came from new customers added in the last 12 months."
33,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Professional services revenue was $17.4 million in Q1 2020, an increase of 26% from the same quarter last year. Growth was driven by helping customers migrate to inline XBRL, additional revenue and setup in consulting and organic XBRL growth."
34,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As a reminder, the first quarter is seasonally the high point for our revenue from XBRL tagging since most of our publicly traded customers prepare their 10-Ks in the first quarter."
35,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,35,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our supplemental metrics. We finished Q1 with 3,507 customers, a net increase of 141 customers from Q1 2019 and a net decrease of 3 customers from Q4 2019. On a gross basis, 73 customers churned in Q1, which is a normal level of churn for us, and we added 70 new logos in Q1, which is below normal for us and was due to the impact of COVID-19."
36,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,36,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In early March, 50 new deals in our pipeline carried our highest rating for a probability to close by month end. Of the 50 deals, 10 did close in March and 32 returned to the pipeline, of which 30 would have been new logos. Normally, a very high percentage of these types of deals would have closed by month end."
37,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,37,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our revenue retention rates remained strong. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate was 94.5% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 95.7% for the same period last year. Almost half of the attrition in the quarter came from M&A, delistings and bankruptcies. Looking ahead, we expect a higher incidence of bankruptcies and delistings."
38,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,38,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"On the positive side, we expect less pressure from M&A in the near term. With add-ons, our subscription and support revenue retention rate improved to 110.9% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 110.7% in Q1 2019."
39,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,39,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our progress with larger subscription contracts continues to be promising. The number of contracts valued at over $100,000 per year totaled 670 in the first quarter of 2020, up 36% from Q1 of the prior year. The number of contracts valued at over $150,000 totaled 308 customers in the first quarter, up 49% from Q1 2019 results."
40,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,40,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving down to P&L. Gross profit totaled $64.3 million in Q1, up 25.5% from the same quarter a year ago. Consolidated gross margin was 74.9% in the latest quarter versus 73.2% in Q1 2019, a net expansion of 170 basis points."
41,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,41,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Breaking out gross profit. Subscription and support gross profit totaled $56.6 million, equating to a gross margin of 82.9% on S&S revenue, a contraction of 30 basis points compared to Q1 2019. Additional headcount to help upgrade customers to our next-generation platform was the primary driver of the contraction."
42,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,42,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Professional services gross profit in the first quarter was $7.6 million, equating to a 43.7% gross margin compared to 32.7% in Q1 2019 due to improved utilization."
43,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,43,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Research and development expense in Q1 totaled $21.4 million, up 6.5% from Q1 2019, primarily due to higher compensation costs. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 25% in Q1 2020 from 28.7% in Q1 2019."
44,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,44,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Sales and marketing expense for the quarter increased 42.6% from Q1 2019 to $33.4 million, reflecting our investment in sales talent primarily to drive bookings in EMEA, integrated risk, global statutory reporting and U.S. government."
45,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,45,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"General and administrative expenses totaled $8.7 million in Q1, up $1.9 million compared to Q1 2019. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 40 basis points to 10.1% due to additional headcount, higher software expenses and increased rent expense."
46,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,46,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We posted an operating profit of $800,000 in Q1 2020 compared to an operating profit of $900,000 in Q1 last year. Workiva's operating margin in Q1 was substantially better than our guidance, as I discussed earlier."
47,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,47,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. At March 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $496 million, an increase of $8.1 million compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. In Q1 2020, net cash provided from operating activities totaled $4.7 million compared with cash provided of $5.1 million in the same quarter a year ago."
48,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,48,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"At the end of each quarter, we review outstanding invoices to determine which ones present a collection risk due to a variety of factors, including credit risk, consistent with ASC 606. We remove the invoices at risk, taking the amounts out of both accounts receivable and deferred revenue until payment is collected, which is when we begin to recognize revenue."
49,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,49,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"At March 31, 2020, we classified $6 million of receivables to this reserve account, up $1.7 million from the reserve at year-end in anticipation of the impact of COVID-19. The increase in this reserve account reduced deferred revenue by an equal amount, and therefore, it reduced billings at the end of the quarter. Remaining performance obligations on subscription contracts continue to vary from deferred revenue as we implement multiyear contracts with annual billing terms for some customers."
50,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,50,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2020, we expect total revenue to range from $80.3 million to $80.8 million. We expect subscription revenue to grow at a rate in the low teens compared to"
51,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,51,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Q2 last year. We expect services revenue to show the normal seasonal decline from Q1. And in addition, we expect to post Q2 services revenue below last year's Q2 results. You may recall, we had a onetime contribution to services revenue from a regulatory change in Q2 last year. We expect non-GAAP operating loss to range from $6.8 million to $7.3 million in Q2 2020."
52,"Workiva Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,52,J. Stuart Miller,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The depth and duration of the economic disruption from COVID-19 is unknown. While we have a large pipeline of new deals, we have limited visibility on when the deals will close. So we are suspending specific guidance for full year 2020. However, we are providing some directional guidance for the rest of the year. Relative to the guidance that we gave in February, we now expect full year 2020 revenue to grow at a slower pace and operating margin to improve. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A session."
