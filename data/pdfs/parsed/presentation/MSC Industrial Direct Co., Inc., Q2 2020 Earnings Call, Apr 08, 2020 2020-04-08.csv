3,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,3,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn the call over to Erik.
4,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,4,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today during these unprecedented times. Let me begin by expressing my best wishes to you and to your families to stay safe and healthy. COVID-19 is no doubt, top of mind for all of us right now. So before we get into the quarter, let me start by sharing with you an overview of how we're dealing with this issue."
5,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,5,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We've launched a company-wide business continuity effort to help us navigate the business through this period of uncertainty. As you can imagine, this is getting our leadership team's full attention right now and we are in constant communication with our stakeholders, our associates, our customers, our suppliers, as we contingency plan for what is likely to be an extended disruption to the economy. Our #1 priority is the health and safety of our associates and their families, our customers and our other partners. So those associates who can do so are working from home, particularly in our corporate functions. As we are an essential business, we are continuing to operate our customer fulfillment centers or distribution centers. So those associates continue to be on-premises, serving our customers. This is particularly important because with timely shipping and some creative sourcing, we are helping to keep the nation's front lines running while we all battle this outbreak. We've instituted enhanced safety procedures to safeguard the health and safety of our team, including the use of additional protective equipment and frequent cleanings of our facilities. Given that we're providing essential services to many organizations on the front lines of the response to COVID-19, we do not have any plans at this time to shut down our customer fulfillment centers. However, we will, of course, follow the guidance of health officials, and we're in close contact with them across our operating footprint."
6,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,6,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We have eliminated essentially all travel in order to ensure health and safety. We are also reducing spending more broadly across the company, only moving ahead on operating and capital spending that is deemed critical. We have ceased all hiring, cut expenses on items like outside resources, including consulting and more. Looking ahead, we have well-developed contingency plans to reduce costs further if the situation deteriorates from here as it very well may. I am proud of how our associates have stepped up during this time of unprecedented uncertainty."
7,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,7,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our warehouse associates continue getting product out the door every day. Our sales and service teams remain the face of the company on the front lines with our customers. Our category management team is coming up with miracles to find scarce safety and janitorial products that are keeping our customers going. And our IT team has moved in work speed to enable nearly the entire company with remote access. We'll share some more detail on our actions later in the call, but I'll now turn to our fiscal second quarter that we closed at the end of February."
8,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,8,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"During the quarter, we continue to progress on our journey to reposition MSC as a mission-critical partner on the plant floor of manufacturing and industrial customers. We remain focused on the 3 initiatives that we've discussed over the last couple of calls, to restore operating margin stability and, ultimately, expansion. And those are: Refining the sales effectiveness plan, improving the profitability of our supplier programs and improving productivity by reducing operating expenses. First, we continued refining the sales force and preparing to accelerate growth. Sales headcount was roughly flat during our fiscal second quarter. Importantly, though, we increased headcount in the growth areas, such as business development or the hunter roles that we've talked about into CCSG and a couple of other investment priorities. Our new business wins continued at a strong pace and remained on plan. While encouraging, we realize that the ultimate measure will be our growth gap above market."
9,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,9,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our second initiative is improving the profitability of our supplier programs. Recall that we have negotiated roughly $20 million in annualized profit improvements, split about equally between the back half of our fiscal '20 and our fiscal 2021. The overall program remains on track. We do expect, however, that COVID-19 and the resulting economic ripple could mute some of the benefit in the near-term as purchase levels and hence rebate payouts come down. The third fiscal 2020 initiative is realigning our operating model to reduce expenses and improve productivity. You'll recall that some of this began at the end of our fiscal 2019 with offering voluntary early retirement to some associates and ratcheting our performance management intensity for others. We also selectively eliminated positions where our focus was changing. All of that continued into our fiscal second quarter, and we began selectively hiring in certain customer- facing roles, as I mentioned."
10,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,10,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We also continued our assessment of additional opportunities to align our operating model to the new strategy. That exercise confirmed our hypothesis that we see the path to a couple of hundred basis points and improved productivity, as measured by the OpEx to sales ratio. Many of the identified initiatives require travel and team meetings. So as you could imagine, they're on pause until things settle down. However, there are other initiatives such as some contract improvements and indirect procurement savings that are moving forward as we speak. Our transformation effort is being led by Kari Heerdt."
11,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,11,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'll now turn to our fiscal second quarter financial results before providing an update on the environment and then turning it over to John to review the details of the quarter. Greg Clark, our interim CFO, is under the weather right now and out of an abundance of caution, staying home. I would note that he and his team have been doing a great job in finance as expected. We'll then wrap up and open things up for questions."
12,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,12,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our fiscal second quarter results reflected solid execution in an uncertain environment. Both sales and gross margins came within our guidance ranges, with sales falling below the midpoint while gross margin was above it. Operating expenses were also better than the guidance midpoint. And this was despite an extra roughly $1 million of consulting fees related to the acceleration of the review of our operating model that I mentioned earlier. All told, both our operating margin and earnings per share came in at the midpoint of our guidance range."
13,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,13,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Turning to the environment. Industrial demand trends overall for the quarter remained relatively soft. We did start to see a couple of encouraging data points with January and February MBI readings improving to 50.2. But this was, of course, quickly erased by what unfolded with the COVID-19 outbreak, and you no doubt saw the March reading of 41.0, which did not surprise us. In terms of end markets, the weakness in industrial demand broadened further with pockets of softness in areas like automotive, heavy truck, oil and gas and agriculture. Aerospace has also weakened due to the Boeing developments and the building concerns around COVID-19."
14,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,14,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With regard to the pricing environment, we continue to see list price movements from our suppliers, and we took a midyear price increase at the beginning of our fiscal third quarter or the beginning of March. Realization has been quite good. In fact, as good as anything we've seen over the past several years."
15,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,15,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our performance by customer type. National accounts declined in the low single digits, while core customers declined in the mid-single digits, as this is the portion of our business most heavily levered to metalworking, so no surprise. Government sales growth levels deteriorated to down low teens, which weighed down the overall growth. CCSG remained a bright spot, growing in the low single digits. To be honest, though, all of that feels like ancient history."
16,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,16,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'll now turn to March, our fiscal March, because it is more reflective of what we're seeing since the acceleration of COVID-19. While our fiscal March's sales estimate came in at negative 5.8% overall, there are a few important trends to note under the surface. First, there's a big discrepancy between the first 3 weeks and the last 2. Through 3 weeks, our revenues were up low single digits over prior year. We then saw a big drop-off in the last 2 weeks as customer shutdowns spread rapidly across the nation. This began with the big 3 auto shutdowns and accelerated from there. And I'll just remind you that our last week of March actually runs in given the fiscal calendar runs into April, so included the first 3 days of April."
17,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,17,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The second point I'd note is that we saw a big discrepancy in product line performance. Large orders and sales of safety and janitorial products, not surprisingly surged over prior year, particularly with our government customers. At the same time, other product lines saw a substantial drop-through the month with double-digit sales declines in the last 2 weeks. Once again, neither is surprising given the shutdowns and worldwide efforts to control COVID-19."
18,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,18,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Third thing I'll note, we saw an unusually big gap between our bookings or orders and what we invoiced. Normally, on these calls, we only discuss revenues, but these are not normal times. Our bookings or orders for March were up high single digits over the prior year. In fact, our bookings were up over prior year even during the last 2 weeks of our fiscal March. This gap in bookings versus revenues actually began in February, where we also saw bookings growth over prior year. The unusually large gap in bookings to revenues is a function of the surge in large safety and janitorial orders, scarcity of some of that product, longer supplier lead times and a larger-than-normal backlog in our own warehouses. We anticipate the majority of these bookings to invoice during the months of April, May and June, which would offer us a growth tailwind to buffer any additional softness that may be yet to come."
19,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,19,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'll now turn things over to John, and I'll then come back with some concluding remarks."
20,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,20,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Erik. So let me get right into the Q2 numbers. Our total average daily sales were $12.9 million, a decrease of 2.9% on an ADS basis versus the same quarter last year. MSC Mexico contributed approximately 90 basis points of acquisitive growth in the quarter. The decrease in overall ADS was 40 basis points below the negative 2.5% midpoint of our guidance range. Our Q2 reported gross margin was 42.1%, 10 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting higher vendor rebates. Versus prior year, gross margin was down roughly 60 basis points, with Mexico accounting for roughly half of the decline. As expected, the year-over-year gross margin decline continued shrinking as purchase cost escalation continued to wane. March showed nice gross margin performance due to the benefit of strong price realization."
21,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,21,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Total operating expenses in Q2 were $253 million, slightly lower-than-expected as a percentage of sales. I'll point out that OpEx included about $2 million of productivity investments related to the review of our operating model that Erik mentioned earlier. $1 million of this expense was in our Q2 guidance, while the other $1 million was due to the acceleration of that work. As Erik mentioned, we are slowing our spend on this type of work right now, but we expect to resume it once COVID-19 is behind us. Therefore, should these expenses become more material going forward, we will break them out of our reported earnings to provide you additional visibility."
22,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,22,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on, our operating margin was 9.9% versus guidance of 9.7%. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 25.1%, in line with guidance and the prior year. All of this resulted in earnings per share of $1. Normally, we would take you through the balance sheet at this point in the discussion. However, today, I'd like to focus on where we are as of now and the actions that we are taking to ensure business resilience and continuity during this time of uncertainty. The Q2 balance sheet numbers are in our press release and the 10-Q filing, and we are, of course, happy to answer any questions that you may have about where we stood at the end of Q2."
23,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,23,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"With the downturn in sales that we saw in the last 2 weeks of March, we are managing our liquidity very closely, and we drew down $300 million from our revolving credit facility to ensure greater liquidity. On the receivables side of the business, we have been managing the credit approval process closely. Most new customers are being pushed toward credit card payments, and we are carefully allocating inventory to existing customers. We have implemented noncancellation policies on most large orders and collections have remained relatively strong. Most of -- many of the large orders are coming from long-standing government customers. When it comes to inventory, we are watching our levels closely, but you have heard us say before that in difficult times, we will use our inventory levels as a competitive differentiator. And remember, booking levels have remained strong through March. Should the environment weaken further, we can and will adjust quickly. In fact, we have already made several adjustments to take down buying levels. And assuming volumes remain suppressed, we'll continue doing so in order to bring inventory levels down."
24,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,24,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"On the payables side, we continue paying on a timely basis, particularly those suppliers that give us good terms and a preferential position. Those suppliers offering timely delivery and deep discounts will be pushed to the front of the line."
25,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,25,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our ordinary dividend. We have ample liquidity to continue running the business and paying the current level of our dividend in all but the most severe scenarios. We have conducted numerous best and worst-case sensitivity analysis, and revenues would have to decline somewhere in the range of 40% to 50% before our operating cash flow turn negative. At these levels, we would take additional cost down actions and could sustain multiple quarters given our liquidity position."
26,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,26,John G. Chironna,VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn it back over to Erik.
27,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,27,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, John. Given the unprecedented uncertainty that we're all facing right now, including the lack of visibility that we have going forward and just how fast things are changing, we do not think that quarterly guidance would provide much value. However, we understand the need for transparency right now for all of our stakeholders, including our investors and analysts. So until we get through this period of heightened uncertainty, we'll be providing monthly updates on average daily sales developments as quickly as possible following our month end close as well as comments on the business trends that we've seen over the course of the month."
28,"MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",Presentation,28,Erik David Gershwind,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I'll offer some closing thoughts. Our focus right now is on navigating the impact of COVID-19. I'm confident that we're doing the right things to protect the health and safety of our associates, to continue serving our customers in this critical time and to play our part in keeping the manufacturing economy running. I thank our entire team for this and I extend this appreciation to our customers and our supply chain partners, who've all come together to address the challenges that all of us face. While the impact of COVID-19 on the industrial economy will likely get worse before it gets better, things will ultimately get better. MSC has been through difficult times before. And we will lean on our time-tested playbook, anchoring ourselves in our mission statement and our values. We will continue supporting our customers and our suppliers through these tough times, while advancing our strategy to become mission-critical on the plant floor. Finally, our strong balance sheet, our culture and resolve mean that MSC will not only survive, but we will ultimately emerge from this as a stronger company. We'll now open up the line for questions."
