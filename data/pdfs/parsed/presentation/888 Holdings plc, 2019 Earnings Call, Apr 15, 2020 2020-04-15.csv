Thank you all for taking the time to join us today for 888's 2019 Full Year Results Presentation. I'm Brian Mattingley, Nonexecutive Chairman of 888. I am joined on the line today by the company's CEO, Itai Pazner; and by Aviad Kobrine, 888's CFO. We are sorry not to be able to present to you all in person this morning. But we look forward to seeing you all again soon."
1,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,1,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"Before I hand over to Itai, who will kick off today's presentation, I just want to share a few brief thoughts on the company's progress in 2019 and briefly touch upon the current coronavirus situation, which I'm sure is at the front of everybody's mind."
2,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,2,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"During 2019, the group delivered what I believe to be a very resilient set of financial results. We faced higher gaming duties in a number of jurisdiction as well as challenging conditions in some of our global markets. Despite this, we returned the business to double-digit top line growth on a like-for-like basis. In addition, during the year, we welcomed a record number of new customers, more than 1 million, to the 888's global brands. This is a significant achievement for the group and a very important indicator for our prospects."
3,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,3,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"As announced in our trading update on the 24th of March 2020, the board is monitoring closely the spread of COVID-19, and our priority is the well-being of our global team and our loyal customers. While it remains unclear how this fast-moving situation will evolve over the coming weeks and months and it's incredibly difficult to predict how customers will react throughout this period of unprecedented uncertainty, as a purely online operator, we've diversified brand across product verticals and a strong balance sheet, the Board is confident in 888's ability to manage these challenges."
4,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,4,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"I'm also pleased to report that the trading trends reported in our update on the 24th of March have continuated throughout today's date. With the spread of COVID-19 resulting in people spending increased time at home and perhaps experiencing heightened levels of stress and anxiety, the Board is in no doubt that 888's commitment to preventing gambling harm related -- harm is even more important than ever. We are proactively communicating with our customers to provide information on safer gaming, and where necessary, offer support. In addition, we have introduced new alerts to our unique safe gambling software system, the Observer, to ensure any areas of concern are immediately flagged to our highly trained customer care team."
5,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,5,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"We know that this is a testing time for our colleagues and customers around the world. However, we have an outstanding team and an adaptable, resilient and vigilant culture. We have the infrastructure and mindset to continue to progress our plans despite having to adapt the way we work in the short term."
6,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,6,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our global teams for their amazing resilience during this challenging time."
7,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,7,Brian Roger Mattingley,,,"And on that, I would like to now pass you over to Itai."
8,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,8,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much, Brian. So this is the first time we're reporting over our annual results over a conference call, and I can say this about many things that are happening in our organization these days that is work under a new -- in a new reality and adapting very fast in this reality. But conscious of our time today and the conference call format, we'll try to keep the presentation shorter than usual and, obviously, allow questions at the end."
9,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,9,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So I'll start with a quick operating update under COVID-19 on Slide #4. So the operation has been working under COVID-19 and how -- I wanted to share how we're dealing with this new reality. We've been preparing ourselves operationally in the last several weeks to move the organization into a remote working mode according to local guidelines, and in some countries, even ahead of local government's requirements as our employees' health and personal safety are at our top priority."
10,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,10,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We have now shifted to almost 100% of the organization, working through remote access or work from home mode. And as you can see in this photo, and I'm sure that you're all experienced -- you're experiencing these yourself these days, this is what a big time of our managers and employees' days, working days, are looking like."
11,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,11,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We're trying to continue our project delivery on plan with minimal delays. However, we realize that working capacity is not 100% efficiency. We're putting emphasis on our major projects and doing our best to deliver them without delays."
12,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,12,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"I was naturally worried about moving all of our workforce to remote working in such a short period of time. But I have been pleasantly surprised by how smooth the transition was made and by the level of quality of the delivery in these times. I think this is due to the commitment and the spirit of the 888 employees, which is what we call the 8sters' spirit. And just like our employees, many of our customers are now at home, and their health and safety is also extremely important for us. As such, we are placing additional layers of monitoring, communications and actions around responsible gaming to make sure that they are playing within their means and not getting into additional and unnecessary financial stress during these times."
13,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,13,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next slide, 5. Just to run quick through the highlights of 2019, which we'll obviously speak about in more detail in the presentation. So we had good progress on all of our strategic goals, which led to a double- digit growth on a constant currency basis. We feel that 2019 was a year of back-to-clear growth trend after a couple of years of reshaping our business under the new regulatory framework and requirements. Responsible gaming and compliance are key competitives of our business, and we believe that this is the way forward for a sustainable and responsible business growth model."
14,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,14,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We broke the $1 million FTD record in 2019, with a 22% FTD growth year-on-year, which is the fuel for future revenue growth coming into 2020. We continued our expansion into regulated Europe, successfully launching into Sweden and Portugal, and we are continuing to pursue our strategy of a well-diversified operator in terms of both markets and products that we work with. We continued our investment in product excellence, which underlines the growth of our casino and sports business."
15,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,15,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"I'll now hand over to Aviad Kobrine, our CFO, to give a financial overview."
16,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,16,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you very much, Itai, and good morning to all of you, wherever you are at."
17,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,17,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 7 and the financial highlights. We're pleased to report a record revenue of 10% at constant currency and 6% reported. This was led by 17% revenue increase in Casino and 19% in Sports, both at constant currency. Marketing ratio remained stable at 29%, but new customers increased 22%, to above 1 million for the first time, therefore, reflecting CPA reduced reflecting efficiencies. Our adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $86 million, it was impacted mostly by additional $26 million of gaming duties and $6 million of adverse FX movements. We have a strong balance sheet, with net cash at year-end of $27 million, and I can report that last Friday, the net cash position was $42 million."
18,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,18,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Despite these unprecedented times, given that we have not sought out government support in our strong balance sheet, the Board has declared a final dividend of $0.03 per share and $0.06 per share for the entire year, in line with our dividend payout policy."
19,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,19,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"As we reported in our trading update on the 24th of March, we continue to trade profitably and generate cash with healthy current trading, a trend that continues to date. We do see significant decline in customer recruitment and revenue in our sports vertical, but the decline is offset in part by our other gaming verticals. Uncertainty remains high, and we must acknowledge potential risks ahead. The shortfall in first time depositors will have an increasing impact as the current situation persists, with slow recovery when we exit our current predicament."
20,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,20,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"New advertising restrictions have been imposed in Sweden, in Spain and Portugal and other restrictions in Belgium and Sweden is continuing its steps. Consumer confidence and spending may deteriorate the longer time the current economic freeze continues."
21,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,21,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 8, group revenue. It shows a concise snapshot of our revenue by vertical. Casino, which represents 64% of revenue, continues its growth path followed by Sport, and I will cover Poker and Bingo in a few slides in a few minutes. Our B2B business went structural changes with the migration of Costa Bingo and AAPN from B2B into B2C and the migration of Cashcade, leaving it exposed to the weakness in the U.K. Bingo environment. B2B has started this year well and in line with our expectations."
22,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,22,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 9, group revenue. On this slide, we wanted to demonstrate that in 2019, we generated record revenue of $560 million or $580 million at constant currency. We have a resilient business, which delivered consistent revenue growth over many years, with CAGR of 15% since 2003."
23,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,23,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 10, on the left-hand side, you can see our revenue growth in 2019, and on the right-hand side, the same on a like-for-like basis. As you can see, our larger growth vertical Casino continued to perform well, both normally and on a like-for-like basis, with 26% increase in active and 31% increase in deposits."
24,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,24,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 11, you can see on the right-hand side, our strong customer acquisition trend. Sports, up 19%; Bingo, up 23%; Casino steadies up 43%. Customer recruitment in Poker was not far from the previous year, showing positive signs from the second half where Poker revenue was higher than the comparable period, with further positive trends showing clearly into 2020."
25,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,25,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 12, our geographical segmentation. For this slide, I wanted to show that our geographic progress in regulated markets continue. And last year, a record 34% of group revenue was generated in regulated and tax markets. Importantly, revenue from regulated markets increased 22% at constant currency. Revenue from Italy, which now represents 9% of group, following a year of strong growth at 30% despite advertising restriction from the second half of last year. On the other hand, revenue from Germany declined sharply. It's represented 5.6% of revenue last year, ahead of regulatory changes, and there are quite a few heads."
26,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,26,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 13, Casino. Casino, which is our largest vertical, generated revenue of $359 million, or $371 million in constant currency. This was driven by all this platform, new content, AI-driven personalization engines and effective marketing execution, and Itai will elaborate further in a few minutes. This vertical tripled in size from 2009, delivering a CAGR of 12% per annum."
27,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,27,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 14, Sport. Our Sport vertical continued its growth trajectory, with 19% revenue growth at constant currency to $90 million. Our Sport revenue increased tenfold since we changed platform in 2013 and delivered a staggering 46% CAGR."
28,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,28,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 15, our Poker business. Revenue from our Poker products declined 13% last year on the backdrop fact that we do not offer shared liquidity between France and Spain. However, looking at the chart on the right, we can see the deposits from focus layers, including cross-sell into Casino and Sport, has stabilized from the second half of 2018, with these players generating 7% higher revenue in H2 2019 compared to the previous period, and we see similar trends in customer acquisition, and I can confirm that this trend continues well into this year. In addition, we also saw strong growth in Poker from the Italian market and encouraging results on the sharing liquidity between Spain and Portugal."
29,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,29,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 16, we show our Bingo business. Our Bingo revenue increased 19%, or 24% in constant currency, benefiting from the acquisition of Costa Bingo brands. Pro forma for the acquisition, revenue was down 3%. However, FTDs were up 23% in total and 10% up without the acquired brands, and the positive trends continues into 2020."
30,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,30,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 17, marketing. In 2019, our marketing investment increased to $162 million, with marketing ratio remains similar to previous year despite a 22% increase in new customer recruitment, reflecting lower CPA and higher efficiency."
31,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,31,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"On Slide 18. On this slide, I wanted to show you the impact of our growth strategy in regulated markets, which resulted in $26 million of higher gaming duties than last year. Almost $11 million is attributed to the U.K. as a result of the change in tax rate from NGR to GGR in the U.K., and this was coupled with close to $5 million from gross revenue in the U.K. More than $6 million of additional gaming duties were generated in Italy due to an increase in tax rate and our growth in organic revenue now. The rest of the increase in gaming duties is related mainly to new regulated markets such as Sweden, Portugal and growth in Romania."
32,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,32,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 19. On Slide 19, we show our adjusted EBITDA for the year at $86 million, which reflects $92 million of constant currency, with our margin at 15.3%. As I showed in the previous slide, adjusted EBITDA was adversely impacted by mainly $26 million of higher gaming duties and $6 million of adverse FX. Remember, this figure is before the flattering impact of IFRS 16 at $6.5 million. I wanted to show you a like-for-like comparison to last year. Reported EBITDA was actually $92 million, and you can refer to the details in the P&L balance sheet and cash flow, which are all in the appendix to this presentation."
33,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,33,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 20. I wanted to round off this section of the presentation by sharing with you a bridge between our adjusted EBITDA reported last year and the $86 million reported this year before IFRS 16. During the year, we generated healthy organic growth of $11 million. This is represented by the green book in the chart. At the same time, we took a hedge of $10 million from external changes to gaming duties and $7 million of gaming duties and penetration costs in new regulated markets, Sweden and Portugal. And the rest of the delta is explained mainly by consolidation of our U.S. AAPN joint venture, which include U.S. B2C losses, the new Sport platform operation and the migration of Cashcade Bingo. More detail, as I mentioned, is available in the appendices to this presentation."
34,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,34,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,And I will now hand over back to Itai for his operational review.
35,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,35,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Thank you, Aviad. So I'll start with the deposit trend. And from our perspective, this is a key indicator to the overall health of the business. We can see that after 2017 and 2018 flattish trend, which represents the shift to working under a more restrictive compliance regimes in many markets and specifically in the U.K., we are now back to a clear and consistent growth trend, which is even accelerating since the end of 2019 and going into 2020."
36,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,36,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next slide, 23. Diversification of regulated markets is key for growth but also key for a mitigation of regulatory headwinds and other headwinds like we are seeing in these days. By quantum, the U.K. is by far our biggest casino FTD driver, but we see some emerging regulated markets that are fast growing: Romania and Sweden, which are significantly higher post regulation; Portugal as a new market as well; and also the U.S., where we see growth in FTD's trend since we launched Orbit in New Jersey."
37,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,37,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next slide, 24. Effective marketing. So in 2019, we surpassed the 1 million FTDs threshold, with a marketing budget of just over $160 million, which represents a 22% year-on-year growth in FTDs, with a very effective average CPA of $160. This demonstrates a clear trend of growth, alongside cost efficiency, which is a result of a few factors."
38,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,38,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"First of all, product improvements, Orbit Casino, the front end of our sports product, the Kambi product, we changed the front end and further product enhancements that I will elaborate on a bit in a few minutes; and improved customer product journey and customer funnels in regulated markets, supported by our proprietary back end systems, which improves conversion rates; and change in our marketing mix and channels; and aligning the creative with the fast shifting trends of consumption of content into digital media channels, such as social networks, YouTube and other mobile apps, we made a big shift of marketing into these areas; and much less reliance on the traditional or above-the-line channels such as TV sponsorships, which are becoming more and more challenged in different regulatory markets."
39,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,39,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And next, I'm going to speak about safe gaming in Slide 25. So safe gaming is a top organization goal and priority for us. We have invested a huge amount of resource in developing more accurate and sophisticated safer gaming tools. And the core of this effort is our proprietary alerting and notification platform, which is called the Observer, which has been developed by our data science team and supported by internal and external responsible gaming experts."
40,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,40,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We are alerting and limiting more customers who we feel can be at risk, and as a result of our efforts in this area, we see a much wider use of our responsible gaming tools. We also launched a TV and social media campaign under the title: Too Much Is Too Much, demonstrating to consumers that as much gaming can be fun and part of their leisure activity, but it could also be harmful if it's not done in a responsible and measured manner. We have extensive training programs for management and employees of all levels and discipline."
41,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,41,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And finally, this is not a one-off initiative for the company, I see myself personally responsible for -- responsible gaming becoming part of the 888's -- or 8sters' DNA, and we will continue investing in this area just as we are investing in enhancing our core products."
42,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,42,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to the next slide, U.K. success. So the U.K. trend marks a turnaround in our business and our focus on recreational customer experiences. We have a much lower reliance on VIPs now, as you can see on the slide here, below 5% of revenues coming from VIPs. We believe the U.K. demonstrates one of the most advanced markets in online gaming in terms of the responsible gaming requirements. And for us, it represents a case study for our ability to work and grow under these types of conditions. All of our products are showing encouraging trends, with Casino and Sports leading with a strong momentum in 2019, which is continuing into Q1 in 2020."
43,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,43,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next, Slide 27, regulated markets in Continental Europe. In this ever-changing industry, we believe that market diversification is key. We launched into 2 new markets in 2019, which are Sweden and Portugal, which we are seeing significant growth trends since we launched into the markets. And we currently operate in 6 regulated markets in Continental Europe, EU, apart from the U.K., Spain, Italy, Romania, Portugal, Sweden and Denmark."
44,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,44,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The next regulations in Continental Europe are Germany, which was expected to launch sports betting quite soon. This process has been slightly delayed, but we're in the process with [ HEF ], receiving a license from the [ HEF ] District, and the new markets that we are expecting to launch in the future in Europe, or Netherlands, which is a big potential market that expected -- is expected to regulate in mid-2021, and we are confident that there are many growth opportunities in Continental Europe."
45,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,45,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"But moving on to the next region, which is the U.S. on Slide 28. This is by far the biggest potential for the company and the industry. So allow me to dwell a bit for a couple of minutes on this slide. We had our hands full in turning around our core markets and upgrading all of our products in the last 2 years. And in the last 6 to 12 months, we've been refocusing and shifting more and more attention and resources into the U.S. market with what we call a dual-headed strategic approach."
46,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,46,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The first part of that strategic approach is our organic approach, and we're working on bringing the best and latest products of 888 into the American market that have a different technological setup than the rest of the world, and therefore, we need to make some adjustments and upgrades through our existing products there."
47,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,47,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We believe that, eventually, gaming will represent 50% of the U.S. market potential. When I say gaming, I mean, obviously, Poker and specifically, Casino. And as such, Casino and Poker markets are a priority for us. With the WSOP partnership that we have in place in our strong gaming heritage, we believe that we can take a meaningful share of this potential market in the future. Sports is already becoming big in the U.S. and has the fastest growth potential in the market and the fact that we now own our own proprietary sports platform will allow us to leverage this asset in the U.S."
48,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,48,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"As part of our organic growth plan, we're working on launching 3 to 4 additional markets by the end of 2021, and this is all over our new technical -- our latest technical infrastructure and product that we're planning to bring into the market. On the non-organic front in the U.S., and we're looking at market partnerships with either local land-based casino, big significant groups that operate there and brands or with big and significant media companies. And unlike in other countries where we operate in Europe or other places in the world, we operate quite independently. We believe that in the U.S., a partnership can enhance our market position and market share going forward."
49,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,49,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,We're coming into this market with what we believe is a unique set of assets and the long-standing expertise in running a large-scale growing online gaming business. I believe that this can be very beneficial for a serious and large local partner that has strong ambitions to expand into this emerging online U.S. gaming market.
50,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,50,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to the next slide, Slide 29, a bit about our product centricity or product division. So product ownership and control is probably the biggest benefit of owning your proprietary platform. It creates a competitive advantage, but only when you can leverage this and create superior and differentiated product. The fact that we have been independent and not too busy on large-scale corporate transactions and integrations in the last few years, allowed us to focus our efforts and our consumer experiences and what we call product excellence."
51,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,51,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The investment in both the front end products like Orbit Casino or our new Poker product that recently launched or the new Poker 8 product that's coming in this summer, and the front end products that we've developed, accompanied with our back-end systems and tools, such as bonus optimization, advanced responsible gaming tools, payment methods and expediting cash-outs for customers are all things that we can do when we own our proprietary software. All of these are part of what we believe will create a differentiated and superior customer experience."
52,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,52,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next slide, 30, the road towards personalization. We placed personalization and AI at the center of our product division, with over 700 games today in our casino, 100% of them are now covered by a different recommendation engines in different consumer segments. We have more than 16 AI models in place, working concurrently over our Orbit product at the moment, and 40% of our players are clicking and engaging by our different recommendations that are presented in an intuitive and relevant placements over our Orbit Casino."
53,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,53,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Applying both in-house proprietary models and testing against third-party algorithms and models, we can see that personalization is creating considerable uplift, better stickiness to our products, more games played per player and an easy, comfortable customer experience. We're now developing and implementing similar AI models. And the mindset across all of our products, if it's Poker 8, that's going to be launched soon, spectate our new sports product and our responsible gaming tools are also being designed in the same way."
54,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,54,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next slide, 31, Casino leadership. So we set a strategic target to become the world's leading online casino. Since the launch of Orbit product, we have seen unprecedented growth in the different territories that Orbit was rolled out to. The Orbit platform is the foundation for future developments and enhancements in the world of online casino. And in line with its growth, we're continuing to invest more and more into product innovation and enrichment of our casino content."
55,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,55,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Next slide. The new 888 sports platform. So our second strategic intention is to become a top-tier sports book. Sports is currently suffering, as you all know, from the COVID-19 epidemic, more than any other vertical in our business and arguably, more than many industries in the world. But I believe it will be one of the first to recover because sports is in the core and part of the culture of every country in the world, and they will find ways to bring it back fast."
56,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,56,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"But in order to become a top-tier player, we believe that we need to own our own product and trading back-end platform. Owning our platform allows us to launch products like we launched recently, Up For 8, which is a prediction game, which has seen tremendous traction since its launch. And I'm happy and proud to share with you that just 1 year after we acquired the BetBright platform, and exactly on plan, even with some disruption from COVID-19, we launched Spectate, which is the new brand, our new name for our proprietary sports betting product in Sweden on the 1st of April."
57,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,57,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Unfortunately, there aren't too many sporting events going on at the moment to fully stress test this product, but we are seeing good comparative indicator and cut in positive customer feedback on the new products. The next market that we're planning to launch towards the end of this year is U.K., which is our biggest sports market plus several other markets, which are planned to launch this year."
58,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,58,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to Bingo. Bingo platform, which supports some of the leading U.K. brands, both B2C brands and B2B brands, has stabilized after a couple of troubled years with regulatory developments in the U.K. We're also encouraged by the initial results of the new front-end product that we launched in Bingo in late 2019, which is already now available to 70% of the brands. And by the end of Q2 this year, just in a couple of months, all the brands and all the players will have full access to this enhanced product and enhanced front end. We've also relaunched our 888ladies brand campaign earlier this year, and we're seeing very positive results on 888ladies since that launch."
59,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,59,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Moving on to Poker. So Poker is a vertical that we are long and strong believers in this vertical. And as such, we have a very big product overhaul coming out this summer, which is called Poker 8. We can see that during COVID-19, Poker has been one of the strongest performers, and poker enthusiasts are returning to play poker."
60,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,60,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"They can enjoy a range of poker games, from free roll tournaments and very low buy-ins to poker tournaments, where they can participate from for free or for very low sums of money and play and entertain themselves for a relatively long period of time to products like Blast Poker, which is a faster and more exciting poker game that we launched over a year ago. And the return to Poker is a clear sign that the product is still very much relevant and that via continuous product investment and innovation, it can return to growth."
61,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,61,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We believe, particularly, that in the U.S., where poker is a household game, it has a big potential and specifically, with our product -- with our Poker 8 products that's going to be launched soon, and our partnership with the WSOP, which can lead us to a pull position in the U.S. market."
62,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,62,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Slide 35, and the last slide. So just a summary of what we went through today and what we see as the current status of our business. So 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] was turning back to growth. Modest upper ender for us after a couple of years of regulatory headwinds and required business adjustments that we put into place. The 1 million FTDs we brought last year are an increase of 22% of FTDs are paying off in terms of revenue growth since Q4 and going into Q1 this year. At the moment, we're fortunate not to be too heavy reliant on sports or retail, and sports represented 17% of our revenue last year and less than 20% of our revenue this year. And our well-diversified strategy of markets and products is paying off with our gaming products, partially compensating for the temporary decline in Sports."
63,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,63,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"All of our verticals are on track with new products, which are live or coming very soon. With the new Spectate 888 sports platform live and performing well since April 1 in Sweden. Casino and Sports are leading our growth, while Poker and Bingo, that slightly suffered in the last year, are now stable and even showing initial growth signs. We have a strong organic growth agenda in various markets, supported by our in-house technological platform."
64,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,64,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"U.K. is to deliver double-digit growth under new and enhanced responsible gaming procedures is significant success for our company. And we see the U.S. as a massive growth potential, and we're moving more and more focused forces into that direction without neglecting our core business and growth opportunities in Europe and in other territories."
65,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,65,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In addition, we see that there are several strategic options for us and specifically, these days, such as M&A opportunities, U.S. partnerships and acquisitions of smaller companies that are potential for us. We feel that the business is healthy and resilient, with a strong balance sheet and cash position, which is extremely important always, but specifically in these days."
66,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",Presentation,66,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And finally and more personally, these days, I would like to wish you all health and ask you personally to keep safe as we are still ahead -- as we're still not at the end of this health crisis. And now we'll be happy to take some questions from people on the line. I'm handing back over to the moderator."
