I'd like to start by saying I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy.

8,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,8,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Also, I appreciate our employees who continue to directly support patients 24/7 at hospitals, and our headquarters manufacturing, service and shipping teams who continue to come to work to make and ship our Impella heart pumps. At Abiomed, our culture of patients-first drives our execution, and this crisis is bringing out the best of our employees and customers. We are helping hospitals and caregivers by donating and shipping protective gear, including gloves, shields, surgical masks and KN95 mass directly to hospitals and government agencies serving our communities. In addition, we help manage patients on-site and online in the cloud with Impella Connect at over 130 hospitals, also stepping up the rollout of Impella Connect, which is a HIPAA compliant service that allows Abiomed personnel to remotely monitor the Impella console and interact with the medical providers appropriately on hemodynamic management, alarms and weaning."
9,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,9,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,We provide this on-site and on-phone support at no additional cost to our customers as part of our commitment to improving outcomes.
10,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,10,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We currently have identified more than 100 COVID-19 cases now in our Impella Quality Assurance or IQ database. Every Friday, we host 200-plus physicians on our COVID-19 Skype call to identify lessons learned in treating COVID-19 patients with cardiogenic shock, myocarditis or organ failure and review specific case studies on Impella and ECMO support."
11,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,11,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"And finally, we've created an online Abiomed prayer community and an Abiomed charitable foundation to help employees and those in need."
12,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,12,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Now looking back at the fourth quarter. In February, we saw our U.S. business stabilize through the first half of March despite 2 misleading publications by Amin and Dhruva. Appearing in print, we believe that our actions to educate the medical community on the lack of the validity of the studies to highlight 14 years of FDA-audited Impella data, and to present more recent and robust publications, we're having the desired impact with positive momentum in early March. However, the business was negatively impacted in the second half of March from the COVID-19 pandemic."
13,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,13,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"As a result, Abiomed delivered $207 million in revenue, flat year-over-year, with an operating margin at 28.1%. We believe that COVID-19 reduced Q4 revenues by $17 million or 8 points of growth."
14,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,14,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"For the full fiscal year, revenue of $841 million increased 9% versus fiscal year of 2019 with operating margins of 29.6%. Todd will provide more details on the financials shortly."
15,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,15,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"For today's call, I will cover our business in the COVID-19 environment, highlight our key fiscal '21 goals to transition to Abiomed 2.0 and provide updates on new products and our strategic acquisition of ECMO Technology announced tonight."
16,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,16,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So first, I will highlight our Q1 plans to adapt and execute. We are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. Our company priorities have aligned around supporting patients and customers, protecting the safety of our employees and their families and manufacturing our life-saving heart pumps. Our number of Impella patients in the U.S. and EU declined approximately 45% from mid-March into April from last year."
17,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,17,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Heart fail remains the leading cause of death, and it will continue to increase with COVID-19 in the overall population. However, in the short term, our Impella procedures have limitations because many patients are staying home in compliance with local and federal regulations, and, out of fear, they are not going to the hospital. We have seen that these delays will worsen outcomes as reported by agencies around the world. Unfortunately, until governments and health care officials allow physicians to ramp up patient treatment with acute symptoms, elective, urgent and emergent patients will be limited."
18,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,18,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In the long term, there will be an increased need for Impella support because, eventually, the high-risk injury post COVID-19 recovery. The coronavirus initially attacks the lungs, and for some, leads to failure of the heart and kidneys, with right heart failure from pulmonary embolism, myocarditis or cardiogenic shock."
19,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,19,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We see Impella as a viable and valuable solution for these extremely sick patients in shock with heart failure, and in the coming months, more case studies will be published. For the fiscal year, we have designated a 3-Phase Red, Yellow, Green plan for the company to face the realities of the current market and to keep our team engaged and focused on our goals. This approach will allow us to come out of the pandemic, ready to grow the business and help patients with our lifesaving technology when demand returns."
20,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,20,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Our Q1 environment is called Red due to the restrictions noted on elective cases and access to most hospitals, along with limitations on headquarter's operations. During this Red phase, we are supporting patients, maintaining inventory, accelerating Impella Connect, reducing costs and investing in innovation to meet the needs of the next phase of recovery. We have also taken steps to mitigate the negative business impact of coronavirus. We've adjusted our costs to more appropriately match our revenues in Q1."
21,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,21,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,These reductions are designed to share the burden across the business and start with salary cuts for the leadership team.
22,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,22,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"This will protect our cash reserves, preserve full-time jobs, allow for investment in innovation and position us to achieve our fiscal '21 Abiomed 2.0 goals."
23,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,23,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Overall, this Red action plan is intended to last through Q1. We are focused on controlling our own destiny by increasing our revenue and patient utilization sequentially in each month through June. Our employees already are wearing protective gear and masks that we've been able to provide. And during this time, we also plan to be testing our employees for the COVID-19 antibody."
24,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,24,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We have adapted our business model with more interactive and online internal and external training, education and patient support. This is what we call Abiomed 2.0, which encompasses SmartAssist, Impella Connect, CAMP PCI, which is interactive and online training and education. Abiomed 2.0 will augment and accelerate our training, data and time playbook in fiscal '21."
25,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,25,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We believe that the recent elective procedure guidance by government agencies and CMS has started the recovery phase or Yellow phase, in selected areas of the country. We think this increases utilization into the summer months. This Yellow summer phase will allow for more protected PCI and the return of protocols for stemi heart attacks and cardiogenic shock. Medical societies and government agencies have also initiated media campaigns to advise the public to seek immediate health care support when experiencing heart failure."
26,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,26,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Finally, in the second half of the fiscal year, we transition to Phase Green as we are back supporting more patients in the hospitals, providing internal and external training and education online with CAMP PCI and virtual proctoring, and manufacturing, again, at a higher capacity in both Danvers, Mass and in Aachen, Germany."
27,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,27,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Independent of these 3 phases, we will remain fanatical on achieving our fiscal '21 Abiomed 2.0 goals on product innovation, Impella Connect and CAMP PCI. We will prioritize and fully fund these initiatives because we have the benefit of our solid balance sheet with no debt."
28,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,28,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Abiomed 2.0 will drive accelerated rollout of our remote interface technology with SmartAssist and Impella Connect. The SmartAssist platform is now used in 900 of our 1,441 U.S. sites, and assists 80% of Impella procedures. Within the fourth quarter, we also expanded Impella Connect to 50 new sites, and today, we are in 131 hospitals, and more than 200 additional hospitals already have the hardware installed and simply require the hospital WiFi permission."
29,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,29,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Abiomed plans to transition the majority of our hospitals to online Impella Connect monitoring in fiscal '21. This captured console data will further help us create and improve new AI algorithms to optimize patient care. No other company in this space has this capability. Abiomed 2.0 will launch CAMP PCI, which stands and training endeavor in the company's history. It will be led by a faculty of experts in the field of high- risk PCI and circulatory support. This online, password-protected training platform gives us the ability to reach thousands of physicians remotely and share best practices, techniques and technologies to achieve more effective and complete PCI. We are launching CAMP PCI this quarter and will conduct a virtual user meeting for the faculty and top users in June."
30,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,30,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We are focused in fiscal '21 on advancing our innovation overall, starting with the rollout of Impella 5.5 with full market release in the U.S. The limited launch of Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is progressing well and is now in 69 of our top sites, with publications pending on over 300 patients. Built for surgeons, the Impella 5.5 is the most -compatible hard pump on the market. It is the only forward flow, fully unloading pump designed to be weanable with smart assist AI algorithms. Since it is inserted through the axillary artery, it does not require a sternotomy and allows for immediate patient ambulation, which has been shown to improve outcomes."
31,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,31,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"While COVID-19 travel restrictions in March delayed our first-in-man study for Impella ECP, we were ready and confident. We will deliver on key milestones for this 9-French, 3-plus-liter heart pump ideal for high-risk PCI. We plan to enter the U.S. this year with an early feasibility study for Impella ECP, and the application was submitted to the FDA yesterday."
32,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,32,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, the late majority of adopter customers want smaller access and closure today. We made significant product on our new expandable and recoilable sheath for Impella 2.5 and Impella CP. We plan to submit a 510(k) application in Q2 for the expandable sheath for Impella 2.5 followed by Impella CP. We are confident that both Impella ECP and our new sheath product for Impella 2.5 and CP will allow us to break the small bore barrier in percutaneous heart pumps and utilize 9-French closure devices."
33,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,33,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,Abiomed would like to also recognize and thank the FDA for their fast execution for all of our many submissions and studies with efficient online calls and real-time reviews.
34,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,34,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We are also making strategic investments in innovation and are pleased to announce the acquisition of Breethe after several years of interacting with Dr. Bart Griffith, founder of Breethe and Professor of Surgery at University of Maryland. He is a pioneer in the field of heart and lung transplantation and ECMO overall. Many physicians, over the years, have asked Abiomed to bring this technology into our portfolio because of our ability to support patients, teach best practices and collect critical data for research. This ECMO technology will allow us to treat cardiogenic shock patients requiring oxygenation who are already being supported with Impella, about 10% of our patients, add ECMO pediatric offerings and treat a new patient population with respiratory failure."
35,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,35,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"This acquisition provides Abiomed with the opportunity to innovate traditional ECMO technology, focusing on patient ambulation and recovery from acute respiratory failure, such as ARDS, H1N1, SARS and COVID-19. For many patients cardiogenic shock, Impella is the optimal technology because it unloads the left ventricle, it perfuses end organs and allows the heart to rest and recover."
36,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,36,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Abiomed recognizes patients in cardiac shock or cardiac arrest may also need oxygenation. ECMO perfuses the end organs, but does not unload the left ventricle, which increases the oxygen demand of the myocardium or heart muscle in these patients. For patients in cardiogenic shock requiring oxygenation, Impella and ECMO, called ECPELLA work together to unload the heart and oxygenate the body. We have already supported and collected data on more than 8,000 ECPELLA patients in our IQ database and ECPELLA now becomes an important role in expanding our patient population."
37,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,37,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Breathe is the lifework of Dr. Bart Griffith based on his desire to have a portable, integrated, all-in-one artificial lung system, that is compact and easy to manage. Abiomed and Breath are now in the process of completing the 510(k) clearance and planning a limited market release in our fourth quarter of fiscal '21. We will cover ECMO in more detail during our virtual investor call in May."
38,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,38,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"As an example of what Abiomed 2.0 will look like in the future, I would like to cover a patient story. We recently had a very sick, 43-year-old woman with COVID-19 and shock on Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist, Impella Connect and VV ECMO. Her ejection fraction was below 10%, which means her heart was barely working. A team of Abiomed physicians and scientists, along with the local team and call center, efficiently monitored her several times a day, watching every waveform and alarm. The treating physician and caregivers interacted with Abiomed at every level and evaluated the waveforms to optimize oxygenation, weaning and right heart support."
39,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,39,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,The physician in charge believes this technology and engagement improved the management experience and the ultimate outcome. I am pleased to share that this young women was explanted and discharged home with their native heart and a nearly normal ejection fraction.
40,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,40,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In closing, Abiomed will be smart, disciplined and innovative in fiscal '21. Our operational discipline allowed early profitability as a company and built a sizable cash position with no debt."
41,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,41,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We have built a brick house and substantial IP portfolio. We will endure the challenges and come out stronger as Abiomed 2.0 because of the investments in innovation to have products that are smaller, smarter and more connected in the cloud with AI algorithms for heart recovery. We will share the sacrifices to reduce expenses and take great pride knowing that our people and Impella heart pumps are helping save lives during this global crisis."
42,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,42,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Above all, I remain grateful to my employees and customers and confident in the technology and opportunities for Abiomed. I will end how I started, by recognizing all the heroes at the hospitals taking care of our communities. May God bless them and their families."
43,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,43,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"I will now turn the call over to Todd, our CFO."
44,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,44,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Mike, and thanks for joining the call. I hope everyone listening and your families are staying safe."
45,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,45,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to the quarter, we delivered revenue of $207 million, flat versus prior year. We were still feeling some of the impact in January and February due to 2 misleading publications and print within the quarter. As Mike mentioned, in the first half of March, we were beginning to see a positive momentum based on the actions to educate the medical community on Impella FDA studies. Through the first weeks of March, U.S. patient utilization was up 11% for the month."
46,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,46,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"In the second half of the month, we experienced a dramatic drop in patient utilization due to COVID-19. The impact was broad-based across the U.S. and in Europe. We believe that COVID-19 pandemic impacted our top line by $17 million or 8 points of growth in the quarter."
47,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,47,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"By geography, U.S. revenue declined 2% to $172 million, with a 5% decline in U.S. patient utilization."
48,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,48,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"In the U.S., at the end of our fiscal Q4, the Impella 2.5 and CP have reached 1,441 sites. The Impella 5.0 has been placed in 649 sites, and the RP is in 533 sites. The new Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 69 sites. We continue to receive positive feedback from the surgeons on this new breakthrough technology. The reorder rate in the quarter was slightly above 100%, consistent with the rate from prior year."
49,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,49,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was approximately 4.7 units per site, in line with the inventory levels we saw last quarter. Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $34 million, up 15% on constant currency, driven by continued strength in Japan."
50,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,50,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Our European revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis. As previously stated, our business in Europe saw a significant deceleration in utilization in the second half of March due to COVID-19, primarily in Italy, Spain and Germany. Our Q4 performance in Japan was in line with our expectations as we delivered $8.4 million in revenue."
51,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,51,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"We opened 6 new sites in Q4, ending the year with 115 sites. As a reminder, we had communicated that we would open less sites as a team focused on the post-approval study in a broader CP launch at existing sites."
52,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,52,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"In Japan, we did not see a material impact on patient utilization from the virus in the quarter. However, our business has softened in recent weeks as COVID cases in Japan rise after a state of emergency was declared on April 7. Gross margin was 80.9% in the quarter compared to 83.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by the SmartAssist launch, Impella Connect and lower production volumes. We introduced Impella CP with SmartAssist at 283 new sites in the quarter. Our SmartAssist platform is designed to improve outcomes with real-time intelligence, providing smart, advanced metrics to better position, manage and wean patients in the ICU."
53,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,53,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"In the fourth quarter, R&D expense totaled $25 million, roughly flat versus prior year. We continue to invest in clinical research and in new product development for our small board devices, like the expandable sheath and ECP. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter totaled $84 million, up 3% versus prior year. In the quarter, we increased our U.S. field team by 30 reps. These new reps will have the normal learning curve, and we believe putting more feet on the street will enable us to go deeper in hospitals and drive higher Impella utilization once the pandemic is more contained and eventually subsides."
54,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,54,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"In the quarter, operating income was $58 million, translating to an operating margin of 28.1%. The year- over-year margin performance was a function of our ongoing growth investments, which more than offset some favorability from stock-based compensation."
55,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,55,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,GAAP net income for the quarter was $32 million or $0.70 per diluted share versus $1.60 in Q4 of 2019. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by a mark-to-market adjustment on our Shockwave investment. Our reported tax rate for Q4 was 19% versus 25% in the prior year due to excess tax benefits and increased usage of foreign tax credits.
56,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,56,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Now turning to our full year performance. For FY '20, we delivered revenue of $841 million, an increase of $72 million or 9% versus prior year. We saw solid growth across the globe from continued adoption of the Impella platform. Japan had a strong year, delivering revenue of $35 million, up 101% from 2019. Operating income was $249 million, up 11% compared to the prior year."
57,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,57,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"We expanded operating margins 40 basis points to 29.6%, while continuing to make the necessary investments to support our future growth."
58,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,58,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Net income for the year was $203 million or $4.43 per diluted share versus $5.61 in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by a higher tax rate from excess tax benefits, and our mark-to- market on our Shockwave investment. As we look ahead, we are focused on liquidity in this uncertain environment, and I want to highlight our robust position."
59,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,59,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Our balance sheet remains strong. In Q4, we generated $87 million of operating cash flow and $315 million for the year. As a result, we ended fiscal year '20 with $651 million in cash, up 27% versus prior year, with no debt. We will continue to be disciplined and have the capital necessary to stay focused on the long term."
60,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,60,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Now turning to our fiscal year '21 outlook and guidance. As we described in our press release, because so much depends on factors beyond our control, such as the duration or extent of the COVID-19 crisis and recovery, there is simply not enough visibility to provide a reliable estimate for Q1 or full year fiscal '21 at this time. As Mike mentioned, Q1 is our Red Phase. In April, run rates were down 45% versus prior year. We will continue to monitor the uncertain environment and provide an update on full year guidance when appropriate."
61,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,61,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"We have adjusted our costs as described in our 8-K. This will protect our cash reserve, preserve full-time jobs, allow for investment in innovation and position us to achieve our fiscal goals. These actions taken since March have included a hold on hiring, eliminating noncritical consultants, contractors and temporary workers, reducing discretionary spending and implementing alternate work schedules for the Aachen and Danvers production teams. Our CEO and COO have reduced their salaries by 100%, VPs and Directors have reduced their salaries by 50% and 20%, respectively, for the quarter. As the Board -- also, the Board of Directors have reduced their cash retainers by 50% for Q1. Again, these reductions are designed to share the burden across the business and start with salary cuts for the leadership team."
62,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,62,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"For non-Director employees at Danvers and our Aachen quarters, they will be taking a minimum of 1 week furlough or unused vacation. This strategy allows personnel to remain Abiomed employees and will allow us to quickly ramp up when demand returns."
63,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,63,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,Our commercial field team will work on monthly operating plans to allow for flexibility and the potential to increase sequentially each quarter. We will adjust as the quarter progresses.
64,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,64,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Overall, these cost actions are intended to last through Q1, but we will continue to monitor the environment and extend these actions, if necessary."
65,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,65,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Before I conclude, one housekeeping item to mention. As expected, due to the current situation on social distancing, we will not be hosting a full Investor Day in person at our headquarters on May 27. However, we are adapting, and we will be hosting a condensed, virtual investor event, focused on innovation, clinical data and ECMO acquisition on the same day. Details will be forthcoming."
66,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,66,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"In conclusion, I want to personally thank our customers for their continued support and express my gratitude for our talented and loyal employees during these very challenging times. Throughout the year, I have stayed in close touch with reps and physicians who allowed me to join them in the fields, and I have been inspired by all of our patient stories. It is these experiences, coupled with our innovation, our clinical data and our dedicated field team, that gives us the confidence in our ability to not only manage through this crisis, but to emerge from it stronger. Now I will turn the call over to Dr. Seth Bilazarian."
67,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,67,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Todd. I'm glad to join the call today and provide commentary on what Abiomed's medical office is learning from our physician customers with our COVID-19 Physician Advisory Board, which includes representatives from Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and the U.S."
68,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,68,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,We will conduct our 6th weekly call tomorrow with over 300 physicians from around the world. The weekly calls with the physicians share literature updates focused on cardiovascular complications of COVID-19.
69,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,69,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Each week, a short literature review is provided and cases are presented from hospitals around the world. The literature on cardiovascular complications is evolving rapidly. COVID-19 itself can affect the heart in a variety of ways, as highlighted on the Slide 15 in the deck, and may directly affect the myocardium, causing myocarditis, or via a hypercoagulable state presenting as an acute coronary syndrome with clot resulting in myocardial infarction, or as a pulmonary embolus or critical limb ischemia or stroke. Many of these severely sick patients are candidates for mechanical circulatory support in ECMO."
70,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,70,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"However, most have not received either therapy because of the resource constraints in hospitals. Impella has the potential to increase end-organ perfusion and reduce cardiac workload and shock related to these COVID-19 presentations and may also stabilize patients while antiviral or anti-inflammatory therapies are deployed."
71,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,71,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, Impella is FDA-approved for myocarditis based on clinical data showing a direct disease altering effect by inhibiting the mechanotransduction pathways of inflammation. The Impella and ECMO platforms are effective tools to tackle the hemodynamic features of COVID-19, which might require univentricular left or right ventricular support in unloading using the Impella CP 5.0 or 5.5 or the Impella RP. Also, the configuration of biventricular support, referred to as BIPELLA, with BI ventricular support using Impella in both the left and right ventricles, or combined with ECMO in an ECPELLA configuration. In addition to the case that Mike shared, I'd like to highlight 2 recent cases presented on our Friday calls that highlight the versatility of the Impella platform to support varied patient presentations."
72,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,72,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The first case was a 57-year-old patient with recently confirmed positive COVID-19 tests, who presented with a deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus due to the hypercoagulable effects of COVID-19. And the patient had massive pulmonary embolus and was cared for masterfully by Dr. Ted Schreiber and Amir Kaki at St. John's Ascension Medical Center in Detroit. The patient had an enormous clot in transit in the right atrium that was successfully retrieved using an Angiovac. And then the patient sustained cardiac arrest, requiring CPR. The patient had the Impella RP rapidly deployed with almost immediate restoration of systemic pressures in an incredibly impressive image shown in the slides 17 and 18."
73,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,73,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The patient's blood pressure rose from a systolic blood pressure of 60 millimeters of mercury to over 140 in 10 seconds. The patient recovered and was discharged. The case highlights the life-saving value of early recognition of right ventricular failure and appropriate early implementation of the Impella RP to support patients. And this is an example of the univentricular support critically needed in some patients. This case was highlighted on an ACC tutorial with over 22,000 impressions, and I'd urge you to look at it, the link is in the slides to see the video of the clock being extracted and the amazing blood pressure recovery after Impella RP."
74,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,74,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The second case of COVID-19 infected patient was published in the Journal of ASAIO and as highlighted in Slide 20. This was a 52-year-old man recently discharged after an acute myocardial infraction of Freiburg, Germany. The patient had a presentation initially interpreted as acute congestive heart failure but the patient rapidly declined requiring high levels of oxygen and then, ultimately, develop cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock. The patient was supported with Impella CP with SmartAssist and initially, VA, then switched to VV ECMO, with support over 17 days before the patient's status adequately stabilized to allow removal of support. This case highlights the value of left-sided support in combination with ECMO platforms."
75,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,75,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"In the intermediate term, we suspect that delayed care will result in more advanced heart failure for patients and a greater need for mechanical circulatory support. In addition, one of the longitudinal hazards of SARS infections, like COVID-19, in the past, has been metabolic arrangements such as cholesterol or lipid abnormalities, which increase patients' risks for atherosclerotic disease in future years. All of these unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19 infection provide an opportunity for Abiomed and the Impella platform to improve patient outcomes and to continue our mission of heart recovery."
76,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,76,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,I'll now turn the call back over to Todd Trapp.
77,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",Presentation,77,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Seth. So Crystal, I think it's now it's time to open up the call for questions."
