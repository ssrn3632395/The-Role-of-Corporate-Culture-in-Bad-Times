3,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,3,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, from Boston, Massachusetts, and welcome to Abacus' investor conference call. A lot has transpired since our last conference call as it relates to Abacus, our sector and the world in general. My remarks today will address both, our Q4 and 2019 results and achievements as well as an update on the key developments year-to-date."
4,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,4,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In the fourth quarter of 2019, we continue to develop and expand our presence in the food, drug and mass channel, which has been the key focus for our company in 2019. We secured one of the largest drug chain during the quarter, which placed our products in approximately 2,500 additional stores, which rolled out during January and February of this year. Our strong position with topicals became even stronger in the current environment of regulatory uncertainty that's holding back ingestible sales in the food, drug and mass channel. This has resulted in many retailers focusing on the deployment of 200 to 1,000 stores right before the December holiday period, introduced countertop shelf displays, many of which prominently featured a picture of Gronkowski."
5,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,5,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"For 2019, we recorded revenue of $15.5 million, which represented a strong year-over-year growth of 82%. We posted sequential quarterly growth of 8% in Q4, which is driven by the 29% quarterly sequential growth in the CBDMEDIC business. While we were aiming higher for Q4, as we shared in our guidance on our last call, the difference was driven in part by promotional sales discount that we extended to secure one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the country. The discounts have the effect of reducing both net revenue and gross profit and were the main reason that we reported a Q4 gross margin of 37%. Without these discounts, revenue would have been in line with the guidance we provided in Q3, and our gross margin would have been closer to what we reported prior quarters. The wins that we secured with the discount is already paying dividends. As this chain is rapidly increasing the rollout of our products to more stores within their chain. While I cannot say sales discounts are tools that we will not continue to use, we generally try to limit their use and scope, and we don't expect to use them to the same extent in the coming quarters, the way we did in the fourth quarter. Overall, our margin for 2019 came in at 54.5%, down from the 59.2% in 2018. I will add that with increased sales volume, we have been able to negotiate better pricing from our principal contract manufacture for 2020 and combined with lower hemp extract costs, we expect that this will provide for gross margin improvement. Purchase orders received in the fourth quarter increased the number of retail locations carrying CBDMEDIC products to over 8,000. This figure still represents only about 25% penetration of those chains that carry us. So there is a lot of room to grow in our existing base. In addition, we had and continue to have a healthy pipeline of chains in various stages of the decision-making and approval process as far as bringing us on to shelf. From a competitor's perspective, we continue to see the larger chains, working with a relatively small group of vendors, of which we are one of the leading brands."
6,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,6,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Our primary efforts in 2019 were focused on the drug channel in which we have done exceptionally well in penetrating. CBDMEDIC consistently ranks within the top 3 or 4 of the top topical CBD brands in this segment. In the fourth quarter, we began to increase our focus on penetration of the grocery channel and the success of these efforts will be decided and play out over the next several months, as grocery chains go through their regular category resell plan. We feel good about our position on this front. And while I will talk about it separately in a few minutes, a key reason for our acquisition of Harmony Hemp was to substantially increase our presence in the grocery segment."
7,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,7,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to CBD CLINIC and our health care practitioner business. Fourth quarter revenue was little changed from the prior quarter. For the year, the business delivered a strong 40% year-over-year growth. Our distributor business continued 2/3 of sales and our direct practitioner business approximately 1/3. On the distributor side, our 5 largest distributors delivered over 90% of our sales by distributors and further underscore that distributors with wide reach are key to growth in this channel. At the end of Q4, we established a distribution relationship with one of the largest distributors to chiropractic in the U.S. therapists collectively accounted for over 70% of revenue. We expect the new distributor to be a newly full contributor to the growth of the CBD CLINIC business in 2020. While some competition has come into this market, we are retaining our leadership position in the health care practitioner market and continue to view the opportunity ahead of us at very large."
8,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,8,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to the Harmony Hemp acquisition. We acquired the Harmony Hemp business on February 10 for $5.5 million, of which half is being paid in cash and half in shares. The shares being issued over a 20- month period and being subject to markup. There were 3 main reasons that attracted us to Harmony Hemp. The first was the distribution they had achieved in the 2 largest grocery chains in the country, which combined with other retailers, had achieved a footprint with their products being carried in over 4,000 locations. The second was that a majority of the sales were in personal care, and beauty, the areas that we did not have a presence. Personal care and beauty are 2 of the fastest-growing segments within hemp-infused products that are being carried by retail. The third reason was the strength of their relationships within food, drug and mass, which provides us with an important competitive advantage. The challenging situation in the capital markets allowed us to acquire this business at a price that we consider attractive, given the strategic benefits that it brought to our business. The integration of Harmony Hemp has been going well. Although as with any acquisition, it has taken a lot of efforts. We are very pleased with both the performance of this business as well as the cross-selling opportunities that are being realized between Harmony Hemp and CBDMEDIC brands. On a combined basis, the CBDMEDIC and Harmony Hemp have products are now carried in over 12,000 non overlapping stores."
9,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,9,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As previously announced, we've been working hard on the development of a line of ingestible products containing hemp extract. In addition to our own R&D efforts, we engaged 2 companies to support our product development efforts, 1 with unique cannabinoid expertise and the other with [indiscernible] expertise. We recently completed the development of a proposed line of unique ingestible products, covering several different health indications. Our products are based on both leading nutraceutical and cannabinoid science, and we believe we have best-in-class products that are going to be very well received by consumers. We're also in the process together with 1 of our commercial partners to apply for patent protection for a technology using some of these products. Our agreements with the contract manufacturers are in place, and we had planned a launch in June. Although with the unfortunate arrival of COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to push the launch back to Q3. While I appreciate this activity is largely away from the market's eye and difficult to gauge, I can tell you that the work that has been put into the development of this line and the preparations for the launch, a very significant achievement and a testament to the strength and innovative the spirit of our team. We are very excited about this launch."
10,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,10,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Which brings me to the next and almost final topic of my remarks today, a proposed acquisition by Charlotte's Web. As some of you know, Abacus has a long history with Charlotte's Web, dating back to 2016 and even earlier when an agreement was entered into, which allowed Abacus to purchase and formulate its products with Charlotte's Web hemp extract. Over time, both companies matured and grew and throughout these years, the strategic merits of bringing the 2 companies together became clearer. We consider Charlotte's Web to be the most successful company within the CBD sector, setting standards for product quality, and developing the most highly recognized plan in the industry. Over the last few months, I have gotten to know the senior team of Charlotte's Web and gave insight into their future plans, and I have been highly impressed by both. They are building a platform, which I believe will be the global leader in the industry, which is still in its very early days of development. Abacus has succeeded in building a leading brand, a unique topical product that has achieved impressive penetration of the food, drug mass channel, and this is highly synergistic, the Charlottes's Web business. For our shareholders, the acquisition represents the opportunity to continue to participate in an exciting industry with this leading platform, with a share price premium reflective of the unique position and opportunity that Abacus holds. While the acquisition process preceded the arrival of COVID-19, the strength of the capital base of the combined companies is a very real advantage, and we expect the company will emerge even stronger once the pandemic passes relative to other players in the sector. We look forward to Abacus becoming part of the largest vertically integrated Hemp extract produce company in the world, doing our part in ensuring its continued growth and success, and having our shareholders participate and benefit from this joint. We have confidence that the acquisition will close however, until such time, we continue to operate as an independent company and are not slowing down in any respect with any of our plans. As far as the scheduled for June 4. Assuming that our shareholders vote in favor of the acquisition and subject to the receipt of required regulatory and court approvals and status satisfaction of other customary conditions of closing we expect to close the transaction in the second quarter."
11,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,11,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"A few words about how COVID-19 is impacting us is in order. During the first quarter of 2020, the global emergence of coronavirus occurred and has since become an ongoing pandemic, including since March 2020 in the United States. The full repercussions of COVID-19 on our business are difficult to assess. We continue to monitor the situation, and we are -- and we do take measures to alter our operations as required by federal, state or local authorities or that we deem are in the best interest of our employees, our customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders and stakeholders. On March 15, this year, we directed all of our employees to work from home, canceled scheduled business travels, refrain from scheduling future travel and follow guidelines from the CDC. Many U.S. states, Canadian provinces and other jurisdictions have since given stay at home orders. Our employees are working well and effectively, performing their responsibilities, given the challenge of remote work. And really, my hat goes off to them, phenomenal work ethics and very efficient. As a result of the pandemic, we began evaluating and changing spending priorities as well by taking direct actions to reduce operating expenses to conserve cash. These efforts include stopping or phasing certain service provider contracts as well as reducing marketing spend. We expect that the pandemic will have some negative impact on the sale of our products due to the lower level of economic activities experienced in the U.S. over the last 2 months and which may continue. We expect that our healthcare practitioner business will be impacted due to the likelihood that many practices may be closed or have scaled back their level of activity. Looking past the challenging periods, which we hope and pray more [indiscernible], we are very confident in our ability to execute on a significant growth opportunity that still lies ahead for CBD CLINIC. With regards to our consumer business, the CBDMEDIC and Harmony Hemp brand, our internal assessment at the beginning of the year was that we would finish the year with our products carried in over 20,000 stores. Despite the pandemic causing some retail chains in our pipeline to reschedule the reset date by 1 to 2 quarters, others are expanding their store rollout, and we are still confident that we will hit 20,000 stores by the end of this year."
12,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,12,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In conclusion, it was only last year that the food, drug and mass market opened up to our products. 2019 was the year we established ourselves as one of the market leaders in the topical space and succeeded in having CBDMEDIC products carried by the largest retail chains in the country. We had good growth in our health care practitioner business and believe that with increased attention, this business has the potential to grow much faster. At the beginning of 2020, we acquired Harmony Hemp, which provided us with expanded distribution and product breadth. Notwithstanding the curveball that we've been thrown with COVID-19, we've been hard at work preparing for our next stage of growth with the launch of our ingestible lines, which we are very excited about. Our proposed acquisition by Charlotte’s Web is testament to the hard work of every -- our very capable team. Abacus is one of the largest suppliers and distributors in the United States of topical products [indiscernible] to the food, drug and mass and health care practitioner market. By joining the Charlotte’s Web, we are bringing together unique and complementary strengths that will have unmatched product breadth, distribution presence, innovation and management talent, and will benefit from vertical integration and financial strength. The proposed transaction provides a unique opportunity for our shareholders and employees to participate in the compelling potential and growth of the combined businesses."
13,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,13,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our shareholders, those who have been with us from the beginning and those that have joined along the way. We appreciate your confidence and support of Abacus and look forward to continuing our exciting journey with you. With that, I'd be pleased to take your questions."
14,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",Presentation,14,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,No. That is not.
