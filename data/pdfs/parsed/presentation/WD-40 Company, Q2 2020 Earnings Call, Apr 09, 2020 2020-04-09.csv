9,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,9,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"To begin, I'd like to thank the tribe for their hard work and dedication to the company in these volatile and uncertain times. Our #1 priority during these challenging times is the safety and well-being of our tribe. Today, we will discuss some highlights from our second quarter, but a complete discussion of our second quarter results, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today and our 10-Q for the period ended February 29, 2020, which we filed with the SEC this afternoon."
10,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,10,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Today, we're going to talk mostly about the global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on our business. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to this global health crisis and its effects on both our company and the global economy. Jay and I were at the helm of WD-40 Company during the global financial crisis in 2008. Together, with our tribe, we successfully navigated those difficult times and the company emerged stronger than when we entered. We realize that the difficult times we are encountering during the 2008 fiscal crisis were very different from the ones we are facing today. We are in a health crisis, which is impacting all parts of the globe and affecting economies worldwide. As a result, the outcome is very difficult to predict. I have, again, confirmed in my mind that people are okay at dealing with risk that struggle with uncertainty. And while it is true that there's a lot we don't know today, there are some things we do know. We do know the health crisis is going to be a temporary disruptive to our business and that we will likely be some short-term negative impacts on our financial results. We know that we'll probably face some challenges in the coming weeks and months as we continue to operate a global business through these volatile and uncertain times."
11,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,11,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"However, despite all this, we also know that we're going to get through this. We have a strong tribe, who are dedicated to our brands and to our end users. We have a famous brand that people can trust and which can bring certainty to both our customers and our end users in these uncertain times. We remain committed to making our products easy to buy, which is demonstrated by their availability in over 62 unique trade channels. We have a loyal end-user base in more than 176 countries and territories around the world. We have acted to further bulletproof our balance sheet, thanks to the great work done by Jay and the finance team over the last couple of weeks."
12,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,12,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"For all these reasons, I am sure we are well positioned to navigate the storm as it unfolds from both a financial and operational perspective. This too will pass."
13,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,13,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Now let's talk about our long-term growth aspirations. As a reminder, our long-term growth aspirations are guideposts not guidance and they are probably wrong and roughly right. Our long-term growth aspirations are to drive consolidated net sales to approximately $700 million and to do this while following our 55/30/25 business model. Our long-term targets are still very clear to us. However, with the uncertain global economy ahead, the timing of our 2025 aspirations may be delayed."
14,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,14,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"During the second quarter, except for the Asia Pacific segment, our long-term strategic drivers continue to perform mostly in line with our expectations. Let's talk about the strategic initiatives: number one is to grow the WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our goal under this initiative is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product to approximately $530 million in revenue. In the second quarter, sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were $76 million, down 3% compared to last year. This decline was driven primarily by a 37% decline in Asia Pacific, which was partially offset by increased sales in the Americas and EMEA up 7% and 1%, respectively. The decline in WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales in Asia Pacific was driven primarily by a 74% decline in sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product in China due to the disruptions related to the COVID-19 outbreak."
15,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,15,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As you know, in China, many distribution channels and factories were closed and the greater population was placed in quarantine for several weeks starting in mid-January. These factors materially impacted our sales during the second quarter since we had a significant number of orders that were scheduled to ship to our customers in early February after Chinese New Year Holiday, and those shipments could not take place due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. However, in recent weeks, we've seen factories start to commence production and people begin going back to work. Things are slowly returning to normal for our tribe members in China. Everyone is back to work, though some tribe members are still working remotely. Schools remain closed in many areas of China. So this month, we have some little tribe members in the Shanghai office who have accompanied their parents to work. We are happy to support this temporary working arrangement. We expect we will encounter volatility and disruption in other regions, where our global business operates due to the global health crisis."
16,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,16,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Strategic initiative number two, grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist and believe we can grow the product line to approximately $100 million in revenue. In the second quarter, sales of WD-40 Specialist increased 10% to $8.9 million compared to last year. We continue to move forward with our new packaging that we discussed with you last quarter, which we believe will give us a stronger brand presence for both WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist, aligning them as the blue and yellow brand with a little red top."
17,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,17,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Strategic initiative number three, broaden product and revenue base. Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products like 3-IN-ONE, WD-40 BIKE and GT85 but also includes home care brands such as Spot Shot and Lava in the Americas, 1001 in EMEA and no vac and Solvol in Asia Pacific. Our goal for the products under this initiative is to reach a combined revenue of approximately $70 million. Global sales of the products included under this initiative were $12.8 million in the second quarter, up 2% compared to last year."
18,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,18,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Strategic initiative number four, attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. We are putting the health, safety and well-being of our tribe members and their families first during these difficult times, with shelter in place orders in effect in most of the countries where our tribe members live and work, many of them have been exclusively working from home for several weeks now. Our IT teams around the world have done an exceptional job ensuring that everyone has the technology they need to complete their jobs remotely. We call ourselves a tribe because we are a community of people with a shared purpose, that is to help feed and defend each other. During these difficult times, I think that definition is particularly fitting."
19,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,19,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"There is no better time than now to have a highly engaged workforce. During the second quarter, we took our biannual employee engagement survey, and I'm happy to report that our overall global employee engagement score remains the envy of many organizations at 93%."
20,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,20,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Strategic initiative number five, operational excellence. The world is full of volatility, ambiguity and uncertainty, more so now than I and others have ever seen in our lifetimes. It is our commitment to maintain our operational excellence, which will help see us through the storm just as it has in other times of macroeconomic uncertainty. From a financial perspective, we are in an enviable position. We've always maintained a strong balance sheet and managed our funds wisely."
21,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,21,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"That completes the update of the strategic drivers. I'd now pass the call to Steve, who will discuss some operational highlights."
22,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,22,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Garry, and good afternoon. I hope that you're all well during these challenging times. The impact of the global health crisis on our operations represents an unprecedented challenge that we're evaluating and addressing daily. Therefore, today, rather than going through net sales results for the second quarter, I'd like to talk with you about what is happening right now. For details about our second quarter operational results, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today. As you know, the situation is dynamic and changes every day, so I won't be giving any numbers or any future projections, just a high-level summary of what we know today."
23,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,23,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"What I can share with you is that in March, despite the enormous disruption experienced in many countries due to COVID-19, revenue levels were in line with what we have historically seen in a typical March. While this is good news, I want to stress that the future remains uncertain. First, a bit about our supply chain. As most of you know, we outsource the manufacturing of our finished products to contract manufacturers all around the world. Many of our contract manufacturers have been trusted partners for so long, they are considered part of the tribe. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to ensure our business partners stay safe and healthy. All our partners are following the recommendations set forth by governing agencies and are taking necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their employees."
24,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,24,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Our supply chain is structured such that WD-40 Company products are sourced, manufactured and warehoused as close to our customers and end users as possible. Because we predominantly source and manufacture our products locally, we expect we'll be able to minimize much of the supply chain risk we will encounter during the current health crisis. However, I want to emphasize that each of our regions is being impacted by their own set of local challenges and an increasingly constrained supply chain environment. In Europe, the region most negatively impacted by -- in March by the COVID-19 outbreak, our supply chain was able to produce 95% of our normal aerosol production despite severe limitations on movement. That is a wonderful testament to the resilience of our partners as well as to the hard work of our supply chain tribe. In addition, in EMEA, we had built up some buffer inventory to be used in the event of a hard Brexit. So unforeseen this extra inventory is coming in very useful to help us mitigate the supply chain disruptions we are encountering in EMEA."
25,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,25,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"The additional working capital that we invested is timely and will help mitigate some of the risks associated with the current crisis. In the Americas, our aerosol lines continue to be operational, and we are not experiencing any significant impact to our supply chain thus far. This has not been without considerable effort by tribe members who've pivoted many times to address issues as they have arisen over the past several weeks. We are closely monitoring our global supply chains, and our supply chain tribe members are working hard around the world to ensure that raw materials are obtained, production lines are functioning, orders are fulfilled and customers and end users are getting the products they need."
26,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,26,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,Now let's talk briefly about our tribe. Currently tribe members in 11 locations around the world are under mandatory work-from-home orders. We have 3 locations where tribe members have the option to work from home but are not mandated. Only one WD-40 Company office in the world is open and that is in Shanghai today.
27,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,27,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"As Garry mentioned earlier, things are starting to return to normal in China. We expect the next several weeks will be challenging for our tribe members all around the world, but the tribe's experience in China gives us some hope that we will see the other side of this health crisis soon. Our tribe members in China have been a wonderful resource as they've been able to share their health crisis learning moments with the rest of us."
28,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,28,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Finally, some good news. As you know, at WD-40 Company, we play the infinite game. We are a financially strong company, and we take a long-term view. I'm happy to be able to share some good news with you today. First, we are transitioning from a marketing distributor arrangement to a direct model in Mexico. We have recently hired 8 new tribe members and have opened a new office in the city of Monterrey. Putting the foundation of our new direct market in place has been underway for a very long time. I want to thank the tribe members who have worked tirelessly to make this happen. We're thrilled to share that in May, we will begin to service our Mexican customers on a direct basis, WD-40 Multi-Use Product and 3-IN-ONE are #1 and #2 brands in their category in Mexico. We believe by transitioning to the direct model, we'll be able to generate both faster top line growth as well as stronger gross margins over time."
29,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,29,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Second, e-commerce is the fastest-growing retail channel in the world today, and it is our fastest-growing channel as well. 2 years ago, we committed to our global vision of becoming the category leader in digital and e-commerce, and we continue to make outstanding progress in this area. Year-to-date, e-commerce sales globally grew by 44% compared to last year. We have also recently appointed a Chief Digital Adviser from a leading consultancy who will work with our global tribe to continue our journey towards becoming global leaders in the digital space in our category. With 1/3 of the world's population observing stay-at- home orders, we're seeing what we believe is a seismic shift in online behavior and one that we believe may lead to a permanent behavioral shift in buying patterns. WD-40 Company is well positioned to benefit from the significant change in the landscape. In addition, we're learning from the recent experience we had in China. While year-to-date sales in China declined by 52% due to the health crisis, e-commerce sales increased 39% over the same period."
30,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,30,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,Now I will turn the call over to Jay for an update on the financials.
31,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,31,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Steve. Today, we reported net sales of $100 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, down 1% compared to the second quarter of last year. Translation of our foreign subsidiaries results from their functional currencies to the U.S. dollar, a slight favorable impact on sales in the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been $99.7 million, down 2% compared to last year."
32,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,32,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Net income for the second quarter was $14.3 million, a decrease of 10% compared to last year. And diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.04 compared to $1.14 for the same period last year. And from a financial perspective, we're in an enviable position with a very strong balance sheet and a newly amended $150 million credit facility from which we recently elected to draw down $80 million to further strengthen our liquidity position. We're focused on managing through this crisis to come out the other side as a much stronger business."
33,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,33,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Let's start with a quick discussion about our 55/30/25 business model, the long-term targets that we use to guide our business. On today's call, I'm going to focus primarily on the drivers for gross margin. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 53.6% compared to 55.4% last year. This represents a decline of 180 basis points. The major drivers of this decline were sales mix changes, higher warehousing and freight and other miscellaneous costs. Impacts from sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs in all 3 trading blocs negatively impacted our gross margin by 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. The unfavorable impacts in the Americas and EMEA were primarily due to unfavorable shifts in product and customer mix as well as higher miscellaneous costs. In Asia Pacific, shortfalls in sales in China, a direct market where we typically have higher gross margins, negatively impacted the overall margin for Asia Pacific."
34,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,34,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"In addition, higher warehousing and inbound freight, primarily in EMEA, negatively impacted our gross margin by 110 basis points. Changes in major input costs negatively impacted our margin by 10 basis points. Petroleum-based specialty chemicals positively impacted our margin by 20 basis points period- over-period. However, increased cost of aerosol cans negatively impacted our margin by 30 basis points and more than offset the gains we realized due to lower specialty chemical costs. Finally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our gross margin by 40 basis points. These negative impacts to gross margin were offset by the favorable effects of price increases and lower discounts to our customers, which when combined, positively impacted gross margin by 100 basis points in the second quarter."
35,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,35,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Now let's talk a little bit more about oil. Recently, crude oil has plunged to multiyear lows. Falling crude oil prices will most likely be a net positive to our gross margin. However, it is extremely difficult to know the long-term impact of these changes until we see it in our cost of goods sold, which will take some time. This is because we don't buy crude oil, we instead buy custom-formulated petroleum-based specialty chemicals, which have complex cost drivers, including the manufacturing region, fixed production costs and distinctive supply and demand characteristics. In addition, since the global petroleum market is based on the U.S. dollar, when the price of oil falls, the dollar often strengthens. And for products manufactured in countries outside the U.S., this can leave costs in other currencies much higher. Overall, we estimate only a small amount of the total cost to produce a can of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product directly correlates to the price of a barrel of crude oil. If oil stays here at current levels for a considerable amount of time, we will likely begin to see a benefit in our cost of goods in about 90 to 120 days."
36,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,36,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Now a word about our balance sheet and our capital allocation strategy. The company's financial condition and liquidity remains strong. We believe our efficient business model and the recent steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet gives us position to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. In March, we amended our line of credit with the Bank of America to extend the maturity date to 2025 and to increase the revolving commitment to $150 million."
37,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,37,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"At the end of March, we had borrowed an additional $80 million on the revolving line of credit, bringing the balance to approximately $149 million. Though we are already fairly well capitalized, we decided to exercise an abundance of caution and draw on the remaining balance of our line of credit to ensure liquidity and manage potential risk during this time of unprecedented macroeconomic uncertainty. If no need arises for these additional funds, as we weather this storm, we will simply repay the debt and restore our available credit."
38,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,38,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"In addition to these steps, we have elected to suspend the stock purchases we have been making under our current share buyback plan. We are doing this in order to preserve cash until we have a better idea of the long-term financial impacts of this crisis. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends. On March 17, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per share payable to shareholders of record on the close of business April 17."
39,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,39,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"In fiscal year 2020, we expect to complete our investment of approximately $30 million in capital projects, primarily to procure the proprietary machinery and equipment we need to manufacture our next- generation Smart Straw delivery system. With everything thing going on in the world, we believe investing in our future is more important now than ever before."
40,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,40,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"So with that, let's turn to fiscal year 2020 guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic has injected a measure of uncertainty into our business, which makes it very difficult for us to accurately forecast short-term financial results for the company. Therefore, today, we are withdrawing the fiscal year 2020 guidance, which we last reiterated on January 9. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and we will update you when we can."
41,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,41,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,And that completes the financial overview. Now I'll turn it back to Garry.
42,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,42,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Jay. In summary, what did you hear from us on this call? You heard that our China subsidiary was materially impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak during the second quarter. More importantly, you heard that things are slowly returning to normal for our tribe members in China. You heard that we expect we will continue to encounter volatility and disruption in the regions where our global business operates due to the global health crisis. You heard that our employee engagement score remains the envy of many organizations at 93%.

43,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",Presentation,43,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In closing, I'd like to share with you a quote from my friend, Simon Sinek, "" Remaining calm in times of desperation makes way for opportunity."" Thank you for joining us today. Please stay safe. We would be pleased now to open the conference call to your questions."
