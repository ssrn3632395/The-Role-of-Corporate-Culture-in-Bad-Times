4,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,4,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Good morning. I'm Patrick Lynch, NTIC's CEO, and I'm here with Matt Wolsfeld, NTIC's CFO; as well as Vineet Dalal, Vice President and Director of Global Market Development for our Natur-Tec business. Please note that the financial results for our fiscal 2020 second quarter were included in a press release issued earlier this morning, a copy of which is available at ntic.com."
5,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,5,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"During this call, we will review various key aspects of our fiscal 2020 second quarter financial results, provide a brief business update and then conclude with a question-and-answer session."
6,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,6,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our fiscal 2020 second quarter financial results were significantly influenced by the economic and business impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. When compared to either the second quarter last fiscal year or the first quarter of fiscal 2020, demand for ZERUST industrial products slowed substantially in North America, China and across our joint venture network. Demand for Natur-Tec compostable bioplastics, however, remained comparable to the prior fiscal year quarter, and Zerust Oil & Gas sales increased significantly as several delayed projects from our first quarter were installed during the second quarter."
7,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,7,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With many of our global customers currently running at a fraction of their regular capacity or locked down altogether, we anticipate sales for our third quarter to be down considerably compared to the prior fiscal year quarter. Furthermore, since the COVID-19 crisis continues and is evolving, we are withdrawing and suspending specific full year fiscal 2020 guidance. On behalf of the entire leadership team and the Board of Directors of NTIC, our thoughts are with anyone who has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have had to adjust our near-term priorities, our long-term market opportunities and growth strategies remain intact."
8,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,8,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Our current intent is to continue providing uninterrupted order fulfillment and customer service while ensuring the safety of our customers, joint ventures and employees. Overall, we are entering this period of uncertainty from a position of strength as a result of our asset-light and highly profitable business model, experienced leadership team and excellent capital structure. We currently have over $12 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Additionally, we are evaluating the availability of government support programs associated with the CARES Act that was signed into law on March 27, 2020."
9,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,9,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So with this overview, let's examine the drivers for the second quarter. For the second quarter ended February 29, 2020, total consolidated net sales decreased 0.6% to $13.2 million as compared to the second quarter ended February 28, 2019. Broken down by business unit, this included a 198.6% increase in Zerust Oil & Gas sales and a 0.3% increase in Natur-Tec net sales offset by a 4.2% decrease in ZERUST industrial net sales and a 65.4% decrease in net sales from NTIC to its ZERUST joint ventures."
10,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,10,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Total net sales by our joint ventures, which we do not consolidate in our financial statements, were $24.3 million for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compared to $27.7 million for the same period last fiscal year. This 12.5% decline in joint venture net sales was, at first, the result of already softening worldwide demand across many of the industrial markets we serve and then later in the quarter was compounded by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."
11,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,11,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Net sales by our wholly owned NTIC China subsidiary increased 0.6% to $3 million for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compared to the same period last fiscal year. NTIC China benefited from higher sales earlier in the second quarter prior to Chinese New Year and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. NTIC China sales had returned to 75% of pre-pandemic levels last month, and we are cautiously optimistic that they will return to 100% of the sales -- of the prior sales level by the end of the third quarter as China has recently restarted its economy and lifted business restrictions previously imposed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term potential in China as we intend to further expand our presence within this large and growing market."
12,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,12,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As expected, Zerust Oil & Gas sales increased significantly during the second quarter as a result of several customers having delayed product shipments from our first quarter. However, oil and gas sales remained volatile primarily due to long sales cycles, overall challenging market conditions and the timing of orders and deliveries."
13,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,13,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on oil prices, with the latter impacting our ability to travel to customer sites and to install our solutions. We expect that oil and gas sales will be materially impacted for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. We remain committed to the oil and gas market and believe we will be successful over time as more oil and gas customers adopt our solutions and replace other forms of corrosion protection."
14,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,14,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Now let me turn the call over to Vineet to review our Natur-Tec bioplastics business in more detail.
15,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,15,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Patrick. I'm happy to join today's call to review our Natur-Tec business in more detail. I've been a member of NTIC's leadership team for nearly 16 years. And for most of my time at the company, I've focused on Natur-Tec. In addition to my Natur-Tec responsibilities, I also sit on the Board of the Biodegradable Products Institute, a U.S.-based organization that promotes the adoption and use of compostable plastics."
16,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,16,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Natur-Tec has become a leader in the bioplastics industry as a result of our patented and proprietary technologies. Natur-Tec creates 100% compostable plastics alternatives with performance characteristics comparable to those of conventional single-use plastics at a price that is affordable and competitive. Over the years, we have also formed important partnerships with key feedstock suppliers and developed strong relationships with key converters and brands around the globe. Over the past years, societal and political criticism due to the environmental and waste disposal concerns of conventional single-use plastics have driven significant interest in and demand for alternatives, which has created a compelling global market environment for Natur-Tec's bio-based and compostable product solutions. We believe the industry dynamics for bioplastics is sustainable as more countries as well as state and local municipalities are putting in place sustainable waste management initiatives."
17,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,17,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"For the fiscal 2020 second quarter, Natur-Tec net sales were $4.2 million and were in line with sales last year despite the headwinds facing Natur-Tec associated with Chinese tariffs, the Chinese New Year shutdown and the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on sales in China and South Asia during the quarter. For the near term, we anticipate the COVID-19 crisis will continue to impact Natur-Tec sales because stay-at-home mandates have closed college campuses, stadiums, arenas, corporate office complexes and other large users of compostable plastics. Furthermore, production across the apparel industry has declined sharply as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing demand for Natur-Tec bioplastic bags, which have become an important part of the sustainability initiatives within this industry. Due to the impact of the stay-at-home mandates in various countries around the world, we expect the apparel packaging business to be soft for at least the next 2 quarters. However, to date, we continue to see strong demand from existing and new customers and, during the quarter, began supplying our proprietary resin compounds to one of the world's largest manufacturers of cutlery within the food service industry. We expect this business to be strong and grow as hygiene considerations from the COVID-19 crisis sustain demand for compostable food service applications."
18,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,18,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"As you can see, we have built a strong bioplastics business that is supported by our patented technologies as well as compelling industry dynamics and favorable environmental and regulatory priorities. We are extremely excited to be a leader within the industry, and I look forward to providing updates on our success in future calls."
19,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,19,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,Now I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.
20,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,20,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Vineet, for the additional insights on Natur-Tec."
21,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,21,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"To conclude my prepared remarks, we all know that there is significant uncertainty due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, NTIC's long-standing leadership team has successfully navigated a number of prior crises, including the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. Since then, of course, we have greatly expanded our geographic end market and product diversity. In addition, the size and scale of our business has increased. Finally, the strength of our balance sheet and benefits of our asset-light business model provide us with significant flexibility and resources to help us navigate this time of economic and business uncertainty."
22,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,22,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"I'd like to use this opportunity to thank all of our global employees and joint venture partners. On behalf of the entire leadership team, thank you for your hard work and dedication throughout this crisis."
23,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,23,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"With this overview, let me now turn the call over to Matt Wolsfeld to summarize our financial results for the fiscal 2020 second quarter."
24,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,24,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Patrick. NTIC's net sales decreased less than 1% in fiscal 2020 second quarter as a result of the joint venture operating income, which decreased 17% for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compared to the prior fiscal year."
25,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,25,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"As alluded to in the first quarter earnings call, total operating expenses increased during the second quarter and totaled $6.5 million compared to $5.4 million for the same period last year. The 19.7% year- over-year increase was primarily due to the timing of higher G&A expenses incurred during the quarter. We continue to proactively control expenses. And year-to-date, total operating expenses increased 6.8%, which is in line with both our budget and expectations. In addition, we expect operating expenses to decline year-over-year in the fiscal 2020 third quarter."
26,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,26,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Our fiscal 2020 second quarter income tax expense increased 88.2% to $464,000 as a result of foreign taxes paid on higher level of dividends and distributions we received from our joint ventures during the quarter. We expect the effective rate to reduce greatly in our third and fourth quarters."
27,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,27,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"NTIC reported net income of $180,000 or $0.02 per diluted share for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compared to $1.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the fiscal 2019 second quarter. As of February 29, 2020, working capital was $29.4 million, including $5.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.5 million in available-for-sale securities, compared to $25.5 million, including $5.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.6 million in available-for-sale securities as of August 31, 2019."
28,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,28,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"As a note, we're currently evaluating the opportunities afforded to us by the CARES Act that was signed into law March 27, 2020. While we -- while the extent of the support is uncertain at this time, the CARES Act includes a sweeping set of financial relief measures in the form of federally guaranteed loans that can be forgiven based on payments made for payroll, utilities, health care benefits and other approved efforts to retain employees. On February 29, 2020, the company had $21.3 million in investments in joint venture, of which 48.7% or $10.4 million is in cash with the remaining balance primarily invested in working capital."
29,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,29,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"During the fiscal 2020 second quarter, NTIC's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.165 per share and was payable on February 19, 2020, to shareholders of record on February 5, 2020. As Patrick commented earlier in this call, given current circumstances, we're suspending full fiscal year guidance. With this overview, Patrick, Vineet and I are happy to take your questions."
