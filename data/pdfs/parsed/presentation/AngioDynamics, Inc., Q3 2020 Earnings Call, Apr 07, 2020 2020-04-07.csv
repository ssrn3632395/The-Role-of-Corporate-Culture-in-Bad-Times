7,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,7,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Given the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our company and our customers, during this call, Steve and I will take a tailored approach to assessing our third quarter results and discussing our perspectives on the business moving forward. With respect to the third quarter, we will discuss our forward, we will discuss our perspectives looking through the lens of the facts as they exist today, while acknowledging that the facts, circumstances and situations for everyone remain highly fluid and dynamic and are likely to change significantly in the short and medium term."
8,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,8,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With that said, I'd now like to provide an overview of our operating and execution highlights for the quarter as well as some commentary on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company."
9,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,9,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We had a strong third quarter. We reported solid top line performance during the quarter. Our revenue increased 6.5% year-over-year and increased 9.3% when excluding Asclera, and it was driven by growth in all 3 of our businesses. In addition, we are pleased to report that we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.01 per share. We believe this clearly demonstrates our ability to simultaneously invest in those businesses that will fuel our transformation into a growth company while being thoughtful and disciplined about our overall spending. We believe these results provide continued evidence of our successful ongoing transformation into a more focused medical technology company delivering unique and innovative health care solutions into larger and faster growth markets."
10,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,10,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"During the quarter, we remained focused on 3 drivers to continue this transformation: Internal research and development, M&A and clinical and regulatory pathway expansion. Let me update you on our accomplishments in each of these areas."
11,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,11,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the R&D front, we continue to focus investments on our 3 key technologies: AngioVac, AURYON and NanoKnife, while seeking out ways to increase the profitability profile of our other products. Earlier this year, we announced that we had launched NanoKnife 3.0 and AngioVac 3.0. And we spoke with you about expanding our AngioVac platform through the continued commitment to focused internal research and development. I'm happy to say that we remain on track to deliver 2 new AngioVac products in the next 12 to 18 months, and we look forward to sharing these developments with you in the future."
12,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,12,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In terms of our recent M&A activities, we continue to advance the AURYON technology and progress towards commercial launch through investment in 3 primary areas: ensuring a strong and robust supply chain, building position and sales training programs and building a dedicated selling and marketing channel to take this product to the market in the proper way."
13,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,13,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, the integration of our recently acquired C3 Wave PICC tip location system is progressing nicely and customers have already begun to express interest in this new product. M&A will continue over the medium and long term to play an important role in our transformation. However, we are clearly in uncharted territory due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. While we will maintain our disciplined approach of identifying appropriate M&A targets and will continue to assess opportunities, we will also prioritize the strength of our balance sheet amid this rapidly evolving macroeconomic climate. Steve will provide more details and perspectives on our liquidity position later in the call. Given that backdrop, I am comfortable saying that we will be more conservative with respect to M&A opportunities in the current environment of heightened uncertainty."
14,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,14,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The third quarter -- the third driver of our transformation is clinical and regulatory expansion and data generation, which are foundational pillars to our strategic transformation. I'd like to update you on our 2 most important efforts underway, PATHFINDER and DIRECT. While we continue to focus on these areas, the current environment obviously requires flexibility. With CMS and hospitals throughout the country seeking to prioritize critical care procedures and seeking to preserve treatment capacity, additional site initiation activities and patient enrollment efforts in both PATHFINDER and DIRECT have been paused. We are working internally to be in a position to ramp up these efforts as quickly as possible once the situation allows us to do so."
15,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,15,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In mid-January, we launched the PATHFINDER I-Registry, a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our AURYON Atherectomy System. We believe this study will provide valuable, scientifically backed data to further differentiate the AURYON System from competitive products in this space and build upon the excellent long-term results that patients experienced during the IDE."
16,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,16,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The NanoKnife DIRECT IDE saw solid progress through the third quarter. As of today, 19 study sites have secured IRB approval. We remain very pleased with the pace at which leading institutions have committed to our comprehensive clinical study and securing IRB approval."
17,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,17,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Before I turn the call over to Steve, I'd like to provide an update on how the COVID-19 pandemic is currently impacting our business. Our office-based employees are working remotely and doing so efficiently and effectively. From a manufacturing standpoint, we have employees on the manufacturing floor to ensure that our products are available to help save lives. Given the nature of this pandemic, while we've effectively implemented the business continuity and contingency plans that we've had in place, we've also had to create some new ones to help to protect our employees while they protect our supply chain and ensure that production of our critical care products continues uninterrupted."
18,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,18,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In the interest of their safety, at the request of our customers, we have grounded all of our field-based sales reps in order to help reduce transmission of the virus and free up hospital resources to focus on caring for patients with COVID-19. Despite these challenges, I'm very proud of our team. They've done a terrific job in adjusting and providing remote support to our global customers."
19,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,19,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We have been very proactive around CRM activities and business development planning, so that we are prepared to spring into action once our customers are ready and have elective procedures resume. We have had great momentum heading into this, and we want to be sure we're ready to continue to build upon that momentum as we exit whenever that may be."
20,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,20,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"From a procedural impact perspective, our business includes products that fall on both sides of the critical care and necessary line. AngioVac cases saw strong growth during the third quarter and into the early days of the fourth quarter, driven by AngioVac 3.0. But over the past few weeks, we have seen procedures slow as hospitals have rightfully shifted their focus to preparing for COVID-19 patients. We have seen some slowing of EVLT procedures and even some labs closing their doors in the past couple of weeks. We anticipate that this business will be softer in the fourth quarter."
21,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,21,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Oncology procedures are straddling the line between acute and elective-like. We expect this trend to continue, with some cases proceeding as planned and others seeing delays. We do believe that these are delays, not cancellations, as these are treatments that the majority of patients will proceed with."
22,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,22,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Laser atherectomy procedures with our AURYON laser have been continuing in patches, consistent with other procedures and are still in the very early ramp-up stage."
23,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,23,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And lastly, sales of our VA products, including PICCs, midlines and ports, remain strong even over the past few weeks, driven by our new agreement with Premier and a couple of new line extensions for our PICCs. While the current environment is certainly unprecedented, we are taking the necessary steps to prioritize the health and safety of our employees while also ensuring that we are positioning ourselves for continued innovation in both as the environment returns to normal over time."
24,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,24,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Trowbridge, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."
25,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,25,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to point you to the presentation on our Investor Relations website summarizing the key items associated with our quarterly and year-to- date results. I'd like to reiterate something that Jim mentioned earlier, which is that with respect to the third quarter, we will discuss our results looking through the lens of the facts as they existed at that time. With respect to our business moving forward, we will discuss our perspectives looking through the lens of the facts as they exist today. Additionally, unless otherwise noted, all prior year results and comparisons exclude the contribution of our NAMIC fluid management business, which we divested at the end of our fiscal year ended May 31, 2019."
26,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,26,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Our net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 6.5% year-over-year to $69.8 million.
27,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,27,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Excluding the fiscal 2019 revenue contribution from the Asclera sclerotherapy product, which we stopped distributing during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, revenue for the third quarter was 9.3%. As Jim mentioned earlier, all 3 of our businesses posted solid growth during the quarter, led by strong performances by AngioVac and NanoKnife as well as our core PICCs and ports products."
28,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,28,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Our total VIT business grew 4.3% year-over-year and when excluding Asclera, grew 10.5%, driven by higher sales of AngioVac, which were up 44% year-over-year, and a second straight quarter of growth of our core products. AngioVac procedural volume remains strong with procedures increasing 33% year-over- year, representing our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume and revenue growth."
29,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,29,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Vascular Access revenue increased 10.3% during the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in sales of PICCs, ports and midlines."
30,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,30,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We continue to integrate our recently acquired C3 Wave tip location system and are already seeing positive impact of this product on our PICC business, together with the value PICC distribution relationship we entered to in the third quarter."
31,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,31,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Revenue from our oncology business increased 5.1%, primarily related to growth from NanoKnife, which was driven by both strong capital and disposable sales. Total NanoKnife sales grew 47% year-over-year, including growth in disposable sales of 21%. Total NanoKnife capital sales were $1.4 million in the quarter. This growth was somewhat offset by a continued anticipated decline in sales of our radiofrequency ablation product as well as softness in the performance of our BioSentry and balloon businesses."
32,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,32,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 57.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to a year ago, driven primarily by product mix. As we discussed during our call last quarter, this decrease was in line with our expectations. Our research and development expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were $8.4 million or 12% of sales compared to $6.9 million or 10.6% of sales a year ago. We are continuing to invest strategically in R&D and clinical with a focus on further developing our NanoKnife, AngioVac and AURYON products, while focusing on driving profitability of our other businesses. And prior to the current environment, we continued to expect R&D spend to be between $32 million and $34 million in fiscal year 2020, including investments related to our acquisition of Eximo Medical, now AURYON."
33,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,33,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In the current environment, we're looking to maintain investment in our 3 key technologies while being more measured in our investments in other areas. SG&A expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased to $31.1 million, representing 44.6% of sales compared to $27.1 million, representing 41.4% of sales a year ago."
34,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,34,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Prior to the current environment, we continued to anticipate SG&A spend between $126 million and $130 million for fiscal year 2020. We will support our upcoming product launches as well as the needed investments for a commercial release of AURYON heading into fiscal '21. Given the current environment, we are continually assessing controllable discretionary spend with an eye towards spend and cash management while maintaining investment in our key technologies."
35,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,35,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Our adjusted net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.4 million or $0.01 per share compared to adjusted net income of $1.9 million or $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was $3.8 million compared to $7.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
36,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,36,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning to our balance sheet. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we began with roughly $41.2 million in cash, and we used $17.8 million of cash in operating activities. During the third quarter, we used $10 million of cash to fund the acquisition of the C3 Wave PICC tip location system. As of February 29, 2020, we had $27.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $15 million in debt outstanding."
37,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,37,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We entered this current environment with a strong foundational position, having a net cash position and a revolver with meaningful available capacity. In addition, inventory levels were elevated in anticipation of completing our move out of the Glens Falls facility that we sold to Medline at the end of fiscal '19. In business continuity plans. We've been in contact with our strong and long-standing banking group and are keeping a close eye on the environment. We're taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to our balance sheet. We're focusing on our collections. And while we will continue to keep a close eye on them, we are pleased to say that commerce continues to be moving. We are also paying close attention to our payables. We're not taking a cynical approach, and we have positioned ourselves to be a good customer while also being proactive. Overall, we believe we're in a solid position, and we'll remain focused on maintaining dry powder and being proactive in the current environment."
38,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,38,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Consistent with this approach, we have initiated a modest draw of $25 million on our revolver. We believe that this is a prudent move, illustrating both our focus on cash and liquidity and our strong foundational position."
39,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,39,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Turning now to guidance. As Jim and I have discussed on this call, we're pleased with our third quarter results. In addition, we were encouraged by our sales in the month of March, both on their own merits and in light of the current environment. However, we have seen a slowdown and a shift in procedures during the last couple of weeks. Given the reigning uncertainty, we don't believe it is possible to provide substantiated fourth quarter or full year guidance at this time. As a result and as noted in our press release issued this morning, we are officially withdrawing our full year guidance. However, I will discuss some directional color to help provide insight into what we are seeing in the market."
40,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,40,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As we've discussed throughout this call, the COVID-19 situation is incredibly dynamic, which mandates and recommends changing on a daily basis on both a national and state-by-state level with no firm insight -- no firm end in sight, excuse me. The primary unknowns at this point are twofold: The first is the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it will have on elective procedures. The second is that we are unsure when our reps will be allowed to get back on the road and gain access to our hospitals and physicians' offices. The potential range of outcomes given these unknowns is so broad and far-reaching that we are unable to provide an accurate guidance range at this time."
41,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",Presentation,41,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As we mentioned earlier, we had a strong third quarter and saw that strength continue through the majority of the month of March. We're encouraged by this, but we saw decline in procedural volumes in late March and into the first week of April, which we anticipate will continue throughout the fourth quarter. While this is incrementally more granularity on the current quarter than we would normally provide, we felt it was important to share this given the context. As Jim mentioned earlier, we established exciting momentum through the end of Q3, and we're working hard to ensure that we will be well positioned to sustain and build on that momentum once the situation allows. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator to open the call for questions."
