0,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti of the Maxim Group.
1,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,1,Anthony V. Vendetti,"Maxim Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Dennis, Lishan, thanks so much for doing the call and also for going over the COVID-19 impact across all facets of your business. Seems like most of -- well, all of your business is continuing to operate. And you've been operating, and they have had experience operating remotely. So that side of the business seems fine. It's the commercial side that and the delay some of the trials and so forth, but that's to be expected. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about CarpX. Obviously, this is a resubmission. So you've had a lot of conversations -- many conversations with the FDA over this time period. Do you -- I mean, if it wasn't for the COVID-19 situation, do you believe they would have needed the full 90 days? And with the current situation, is it hard to gauge whether you think they will take the full 90 days to review? Or what -- based on your conversations with them, where are they at in terms of the review process?"
2,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,2,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. That's a great question. And obviously, we have to be careful about predicting anything, but I can make -- I can provide some insights that you alluded to. One of them is that we've been involved with the FDA on this product. This is a resubmission, as you noted. And what I did mention was that we have the same lead examiner, who was very supportive of our application at the beginning. So that was -- we were fortunate to have that, that's not guaranteed, as you may know."
3,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,3,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So yes, for the same people who work with us on developing the preclinical testing and documenting the lack of thermal spread and the thermal safety, the preclinical setting in animals and cadavers, the same people who worked with us to develop the protocol for the clinical study are now reviewing this."
4,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,4,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As I mentioned, we don't really have any sense that they're being affected by the epidemic -- by the pandemic there. They acknowledge receipt. They've -- they quickly proceeded with the acceptance checklist. I've mentioned, we've had some informal communications that indicate that they're deep into the weeds of the application."
5,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,5,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So we've had no indication that there is a slowdown. And we've always been hopeful that because -- and now because it's the same group, that because this is a resubmission, that there would be an opportunity for things to move quickly. But there's no way we can really predict that. I mean this is the counterargument to that is that we are submitting a clinical trial, even though it's small and there's 20 patients. It's a substantial amount of data and information that they have to go through. So I wouldn't want to presume that things will move more quickly than normal. But I can say that I don't think we're slowed down by COVID. We're very fortunate that we have the same group reviewing it. And we've had some informal communications that indicates that they are well into their -- so they're deep into their review of the application."
6,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,6,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"No, that's very helpful, Lishan. And if you could just give a little bit more color on EsoGuard in terms of feedback from KOLs during your initial commercial launch here. How is that going..."
7,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,7,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Sure. I mean, it's been -- I mean, I'm just going to sound cheerleader-ish a little bit, but it's not absolutely remarkable. I mean, the feedback has been excellent. We have really solid people on the ground. Our Eastern sales manager is a long-time veteran of the GI space. And the people who are -- the independent reps who are already on the phone and on e-mail contacted to doctors are having these conversations, and these conversations are going very well. I mean, we have them well trained with objection handling to handle all the various tasks that these conversations can take about how it relates to their existing endoscopy business and so forth. And the feedback we're getting, and I receive a lot of these is that people ultimately get it. They understand that there's an opportunity here to enlarge the funnel and to bring more patients that are not in this group of sort of 90% of the patients should be getting screened who were not getting screened as a way to expand the funnel and to ultimately both benefit patients and benefit their practice."
8,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,8,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The practice -- some of the larger practices already have a subset of their physicians who run esophageal clinic, they run motility and VH clinic. And any concern we had about sort of where this would fit in within their practices, it's probably not material. The feedback has been, yes, let's get started and let's get rolling and get these patients into these clinics. So I really can honestly say the feedback has been extremely positive. And once we -- once they're actually able to do procedures, we expect -- we have to be pretty quick and substantial."
9,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,9,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It's great. And so just obviously, the commercial launch is going to be stalled by COVID-19, do you think there'll be some pent-up demand as you're having these conversations?"
10,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,10,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. No, definitely. Yes. It started to wrap. But yes, exactly. That's the point I was trying to get across, which is that there is still a lot of activity. And because of the existing relationships of these reps, they are able to pick up the phone and talk to their long-time physician colleagues about this technology and begin that process. So all of that activity has really been -- it's somewhat affected, but it's been proceeding pretty aggressively. The only thing we can't do are actually procedure, right? And so I think the way you describe it is exactly right, but there will be pent-up demand and that will make up somewhere for lost time because of the activities that are currently ongoing."
11,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,11,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [ Asif Ahmed ].
12,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,12,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Just I want a quick follow-up on Lucid and since you guys have all the stuff lined up. Would there be any chance -- you don't have to go into details if there something is confidential, obviously, but any chance that you guys are spinning off running Lucid as a separate entity? I mean, has there been any plans or anything? We just want to -- obviously, many of the guys that I'm working with, they would like to know and are really interested in if there's anything you can say that, that is obviously safe and secure to say."
13,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,13,Dennis M. McGrath,"President, CFO & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"That's a great question, and it's one that is a frequent inquiry made of us. And so I'm not going to answer your question very specifically because it is a strategic plan that the Board will mull over continuously. I'm going to give you a more broad answer. Our plans this year include a bunch of activities that Lishan thoroughly went through that we'll modulate our burn rate from where it is now and where are the clinical trials once they ramp up. And there are many access points for us to finance that business. We can finance as we have at the parent level. We can finance with debt. We've been creative with that."
14,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,14,Dennis M. McGrath,"President, CFO & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Fortunately, we'd evolve to a level of sophistication that the early days of PAVmed's immaturity had different types of financing structures. One, as you suggest, is a financing inside the subsidiary in whatever form that takes private or public financing. It's a tool, a proceeds from an M&A transaction on one of our assets and revenues for the second half."
15,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,15,Dennis M. McGrath,"President, CFO & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"So your question, although I can't specifically answer because no firm decision has been made about that, the ability to finance inside a subsidiary and treat that as its own separate entity. Right now, we look at this as a single segment with 4 divisions. But what you're suggesting is something that could be available to us in the future. And as it continues to evolve, we'll be opportunistic that -- and take action in best interest of shareholders."
16,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,16,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,Our next question's come from the line of [ Robert Wileman ].
17,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,17,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,It's in regards to -- I believe there's a provision in the latest round of convertible notes that speaks about the requirement of a sale of an asset by the end of June to provide a source of nondilutive financing. Is that something that we expect to still come to fruition? Is that a provision that is -- that could be sort of renegotiated if an acceptable terms for sale of an asset don't present themselves? Just could you provide as much context as you can around that?
18,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,18,Dennis M. McGrath,"President, CFO & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, sure thing. Let me expand your comment just a bit to add context. When we completed the -- engaged in the November financing, you'll recall there were 2 pieces of that puzzle. The Series A financing are notes that we got -- received $7 million. And the Series B, that was an additional $7 million of debt, $6.3 million of net proceeds. Available option to us that had prerequisite conditions to be achieved, one of them is what you just outlined that a nondilutive financing at a certain level would occur before a certain date. And that condition was waived as indicated by the financing last week. I mean, investors are so delighted with the progress of the company, the continued involvement of our value, but we waive that condition."
19,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,19,Dennis M. McGrath,"President, CFO & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Now that's not an indication that we have lost sight of that. As Lishan indicated in his remarks, we are actively engaged in M&A-related activities, including our NextFlo with multiple parties. So although we're not prepared to speak specifically to that at this point, rest assured, there are ongoing discussions related to that. So hopefully, that answered your question."
20,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,20,Dennis M. McGrath,"President, CFO & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"It does. That was helpful. And in terms of NextFlo, is -- we're talking with multiple parties, and I would imagine, gauging their interest. In the background, are we also progressing towards the FDA clearance for that device where presumably the value of that would go up substantially?"
21,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,21,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Sorry, I wasn't clear about that. I did try to mention that in my comments. So the answer is yes. The way -- the best way to understand that is to think of NextFlo as a platform technology, as I mentioned, with multiple applications. So the application that we had always focused on and the one that was the center of most of our commentary was this infusion set to replace electronic infusion pumps. And that product is, in fact, as you asked, advancing through our design control development process, and we're looking to have submission to the FDA before the end of the year. So that is moving along, and we are definitely keeping the parties that we're talking to informed about that."
22,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,22,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"What's interesting is that they would come back to us and express interest in these other applications beyond the infusion set new patient refusing to that. And it's because of their inquiries around this that we have started to pursue these other applications, which is disposable infusion pumps and particularly that and the prefilled drug infusions. And that's actually enhanced our ability to have these conversations. So the way this ultimately could evolve would be that we enter into agreements that start with 1 particular application with milestones or time lines that extend for other applications. And even in theory, have multiple transactions with different parties where we're licensing or they're acquiring the technology for certain applications. Does that make sense?"
23,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,23,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"But yes, the simple answer is we absolutely are moving the products along both because we would like to eventually commercialize them, but also, as you said, because that does, in fact, enhance the value."
24,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,24,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the John Levin of Levin Capital.
25,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,25,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Lishan, Dennis, congratulations on all you're doing, it's really terrific. The presentation was wonderful. EsoGuard and EsoCheck -- I'm outside, so it's hard to hear me, forgive me."
26,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,26,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,We can hear you fine.
27,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,27,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We can hear you fine, sorry."
28,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,28,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Why are you not able to sell any -- what?
29,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,29,John Andrew Levin,"Levin Capital Strategies, L.P.",ANALYSTS,"But I guess that didn't happen, right?"
30,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,30,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Why are you not able to -- okay. Why are you not able to sell any of it yet? I understand COVID is an impediment, but is there some technical reason that you're in pre-K? You may have said and I missed it. What is the impediment to getting [indiscernible] sales?"
31,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,31,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. The impediment is simply that there are no procedures being performed. So for us to effectively sell EsoGuard and EsoCheck, the physician has to perform a procedure, get a sample, send the sample to procedures being performed, there's no sort of stocking inventory right now. It's just we have to wait for procedures to come up. So we are building up demand. There's no doubt about that. And once we're -- things open up, so we'll be able to sell it."
32,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,32,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Perfect. I understand. I would have assumed for their most vulnerable or their most favorite patients, they would have said, ""oh, sneak into our office, and we'll get one done to you."""
33,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,33,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, there really is none of that right now. I mean, we've actually had some creative conversations about moving them with equipment as cars passed by and so forth. But for all classical purposes, it has to wait till that comeback. But don't come back sooner than you might think because you can't wait forever."
34,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,34,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,I understand. I was just trying to make sure there was no regulatory or procedural or some kind of...
35,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,35,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"No, no, no. Not at all. We were off to the races, and then things came to a hold. Yes."
36,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,36,John Andrew Levin,"Levin Capital Strategies, L.P.",ANALYSTS,"Well, let me follow that up, if I may. When you're offer the races, in patients -- what percentage of the -- how many -- when you were at the races, how many horses ran? And what was the result with the horses that ran?"
37,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,37,John Andrew Levin,"Levin Capital Strategies, L.P.",ANALYSTS,"Yes. We were just getting started. So we only had a handful of patients at 2 sites, before we -- before things shut down. But those cases went fine. Those physicians and their staff were trained. They were able to perform the procedure. The samples were sent. So everything was successful in that regard. But it was only a handful before the elective procedure started to end. But as I mentioned, we have 100 -- over -- we are in contact with well over 100, maybe close to 200 accounts right now as we speak. So those conversations were -- they're priming and gearing up to go once things open up."
38,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,38,John Andrew Levin,"Levin Capital Strategies, L.P.",ANALYSTS,We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
39,"PAVmed Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,39,Lishan Aklog,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you all for joining this afternoon and for your questions. We look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress via our news releases and periodic conference calls such as this one, encourage you to continue to stay in contact, which many of you have with Mike directly with any questions at jmh@pavmed.com. Thank you for joining us today. You have a great day, and stay safe."
