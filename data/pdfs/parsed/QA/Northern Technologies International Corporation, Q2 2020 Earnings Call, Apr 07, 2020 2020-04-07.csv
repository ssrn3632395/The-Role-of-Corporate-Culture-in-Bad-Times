0,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Clarkson from Van Clemens Capital.
1,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,1,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,"Just some questions. I know that we're putting a little bit more emphasis on the compostable part of the business. And just some basic questions that are, I think, critical to understanding this. Can you explain the difference between compostable products and biodegradable products?"
2,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,2,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Tim, this is Vineet. Yes. I'll take that. So biodegradable products are -- is a very general term. There's a lot of spurious products in the market, which use conventional plastics and they'll add additives to it and they'll call them oxo-degradable. Unfortunately, these kind of products are not considered biodegradable, especially in places like the State of California and there are rules, which prohibit the marketing of such mislabeled products. Our products or the products that Natur-Tec sells are certified compostable. And what that means is that in a composting environment, 100% of the product gets converted to -- is consumed by the microorganisms in the disposal environment as a food source and gets converted to CO2, water and biomass. So these are certified compostable by independent third-party labs."
3,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,3,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,Great. Now what are the characteristics that make Natur-Tec's compostable products superior to the competitions?
4,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,4,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"We -- the main advantage really is our products are stronger. We formulate them. We have extremely good understanding of the chemistry behind these materials, and we use that understanding to formula products that are stronger, cheaper and easier to process on conventional plastics processing equipment."
5,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,5,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,"Right. Now can you explain how that dynamic played into -- I know you mentioned this significant new opportunity you have for the company that makes cutlery, can you explain how that acted you getting that contract?"
6,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,6,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"So this is a large brand. They sell a lot of cutlery, single-use disposable cutlery in the U.S. market. They have been working with polylactic acid or PLA, which is one of the raw materials for over 5 years and they didn't have any success. They came to us. And we actually had a compound or a resin solution that actually would work in this situation. So we worked closely with one our conversion partners in Asia and developed a solution that met the rigorous performance requirements for this brand. And it's the unique understanding of the chemistry as well as the processing that allowed us to create a solution that met the performance tolerances for this specific brand."
7,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,7,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,I heard that the competition's products would get clogged in the machines?
8,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,8,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Well, the competition's products, they would get warped or they wouldn't perform as well. They didn't have the heat resistance or the strength required for the application."
9,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,9,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,Right. Okay. Can you explain this -- the concept of having a close system in a cafeteria or fast food? And how that would work to divert commonly trashed organic waste into a compostable system?
10,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,10,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"So if you look at municipal solid waste streams pretty much in any city or state, about 50%, 55% of the municipal solid waste stream is what is called organic waste. There's food waste, yard waste, compostable paper. And typically, a lot of these municipalities and states have passed regulations, which prohibit the dumping of this organic waste into landfills. These have to be collected separately and sent to industrial composting facilities. And the reason for that is this organic waste actually in a landfill would generate methane and methane is 25x more dangerous as a greenhouse gas as compared to CO2. So what our compostable products do is they assist in the collection of this organic waste. And if you look at universities or school districts or large office campuses, they have cafeterias on site, and they will use our compostable cutlery. They'll use our compostable bags. They'll collect the food waste as well as the back-of-the-kitchen vegetable peels and other waste, and they'll divert all of that organic waste away from landfills to composting. And so that's what is called zero-waste systems, closed-loop systems, and that's where our compostable products really come in and help enable the implementation of these closed-loop initiatives."
11,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,11,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,"And would that work in fast food places, too?"
12,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,12,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It's starting to. A lot of the -- if you look at cities out in the West Coast, they are now saying that fast food or QSR restaurants have to comply with the organic diversion mandates in those cities. So large QSR chains, like McDonald's, are now looking to implement, especially in the -- with eat-in-the-restaurant options, they are looking to implement compostable products."
13,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,13,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. One last question, and I'll quit hogging. This is to the, I guess, to Matt and Pat. I mean, is there a consideration ever of spinning off the Natur-Tec division and maybe raising some money separately?"
14,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,14,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,We've talked about that but we don't have any specific plans for that in place at this time.
15,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,15,Timothy Clarkson,"Van Clemens & Co., Inc.",ANALYSTS,"I mean, just theoretically, if you did do that, what would be potentially some of the advantages of doing that?"
16,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,16,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Matt, you want to talk about that?"
17,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,17,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"I think the clear advantage would be that Natur-Tec as a stand-alone entity could potentially drive -- it would be -- it would potentially drive not necessarily a different investor set but certainly with the current environment from investing as far as the opportunities with green technologies, I think it would potentially be valued a little differently and probably a little bit higher than the traditional Northern Technologies market that serves more of an -- more industrial applications and oil and gas applications. So as a stand- alone, I think, it would potentially be a very clear, nice environmental investment. But I think ultimately, we're waiting -- we would like to see revenues grow significantly higher than where they are now in order to be able to do that. packaging product like this."
18,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,18,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Correct.
19,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,19,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,Correct.
20,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,20,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of [ Kim Chatard ] from [ Merit Investments ].
21,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,21,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Just on the expenses, they were a little bit higher in this quarter. Can you maybe help with what the year might look like in absolute dollars for expenses?"
22,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,22,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. As I take a look at it, one of the things the company is always -- not always, but certainly over the past few years has strived to do is have total operating expense growth in the mid-single digits. So when I look at the year-to-date number, total operating expense has grown by about 6.8%. That's pretty much in line with where we expected to be for the full year. However, given what's going on right now with the COVID-19, no travel, people working from home, I would anticipate that, for the next at least probably 3 or 4 months, we're going to see a dramatic decrease in our operating expenses. So for the full year, I would probably anticipate that going down -- as far as the growth year-over-year going down to the low single digits, maybe 2% or 3% operating growth. So something in the low $20 million number."
23,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,23,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard from Northland.
24,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,24,Auguste Philip Richard,"Northland Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Yes. Just real quick. China announced early this year a ban on single-use plastic. A lot has changed since then. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? Is there an opportunity for you as they try to move to compostable or eliminate its use?
25,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,25,Vineet R. Dalal,VP & Director of Global Market Development - Natur-Tec,EXECUTIVES,"You're talking about China, right? Yes. So this was announced right before the Chinese New Year shutdown, and then they had the COVID-19 crisis. It's a positive development in our view, but there's still -- we still have to kind of figure out the exact details because the proof is going to be in the pudding to say as in the implementation is going to be very critical. The enforcement of that ban is going to be critical. And so with all this uncertainty, it still remains to be seen how that's going to pan out. But yes, our team in China is looking at that as a potential opportunity for us."
26,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,26,Auguste Philip Richard,"Northland Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about, as the travel restrictions, et cetera, went into place in China, what that trajectory look like? And then now that it's coming out, what that trajectory look like? And then can you compare and contrast that to the U.S. and Europe, what you've seen so far as these regions have shifted to adapt to the reality of COVID-19?"
27,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,27,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. When looking at China, basically, what we had is we had sales that were really starting to rebound in our -- in the first -- with what we are starting to see coming out of first quarter into the second quarter, we were having some relatively strong months as we talked about during the prepared remarks. China year-over-year, including 3 to 6 months, is basically flat. And given what we saw basically with the entire shutdown of everything in China starting on January 15 pretty much through the end of the quarter, to be flat was a little bit surprising to us because obviously, we had a strong December and strong first half of January to be able to achieve that. So coming out of the shutdown, basically the entire month of March, things are starting to ramp back up. The second half of March was significantly stronger than the first half. And ultimately, March finished -- marked -- our China numbers for March finished where they were operating close to 80% of what the, call it, the pre-January 15 run rate was."
28,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,28,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"And so with the discussions that we've had with that leadership team and looking at their anticipated product shipments kind of throughout April and then the rest of the quarter and the rest of the year, they expect to back up operating above 100% of what the run rate was pre-pandemic, they expect to be above that run rate basically starting with the end of April and May. So we're seeing a pretty quick rebound in the Chinese market kind of coming out of the shutdown."
29,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,29,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"As far as how that kind of flowed through the rest of the world, it seems like, at least to us with kind of talking to various partners, that obviously, what's going on in Europe and what's going on in North America is probably about 3 to 5 weeks behind -- 3 to 6 weeks behind where China was during that time period as we've seen things spread. And obviously, if you look at the charts, you can kind of see almost exactly the number of days, everything is behind. I don't know if the United States is going to be as capable as China was in shutting things down and then coming back out of it, similar to Europe. China basically shut down from January 15 until, let's say, the end of February, so basically 45 days. I would guess that it's going to take the Europe and United States, if you're on that same trajectory, would potentially be 2x that. But still, it looks -- if it follows that kind of that same path, we're looking at a couple months of things being very slow, where we anticipate our sales to drop dramatically in kind of April and May. And then hopefully, at that point in time, we can start seeing the sales rebound."
30,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,30,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"So that's kind of what our -- what we're modeling internally as far as how we're keeping things on hold, how we're working through sales. I do know that because of, I would say -- especially in North America, where we have the most visibility into our customers, I think a lot of our customers had the ability to at least see what was going on in other parts of the world. And so we saw a little bit of a stocking up take place in March. So even though things were starting to slide a little bit in February and people were getting a little bit cautious, there certainly were some opportunities that we had, where people were shutting down plants or stocking up for when they were going to restart business that made March not as -- March was stronger than what we anticipated it would be, even though everybody in NTIC was basically working from home except for the operations team and the shipping team and things like that. So that's really what we're keeping our eye on is how quickly the United States would be able to kind of come out of that -- kind of come out of -- when we'll bottom out and then when will start to rebound from on that."
31,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,31,Auguste Philip Richard,"Northland Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And just one follow-up. The peak to trough in China versus the peak to trough in U.S. and Europe, was that 100%, 25% or whatever it was in China? What did that look like? Has U.S. and Europe shut off as tightly at this point or not quite so much?"
32,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,32,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Well, I don't think it certainly hasn't shut off. I mean, in China, what happened is everything was shut down and nothing shipped. I mean, literally, the -- when they did a shutdown, it was -- there was not one order delivered, placed during that 45-day period. Maybe people -- they just did not leave their homes, anybody. And what we're seeing in Europe and what we're seeing in North America is people are still going to work. People are still shipping products. People are still -- it's just everything from an industrial standpoint as far as car production and things like that was still taking place. Now we know that the big 3 auto companies have since put in place a 2- or 3-week shutdown that they're in the middle of. But what we saw in China was dramatically different than any of the responses that we've seen in Europe or in North America."
33,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,33,Matthew C. Wolsfeld,CFO & Corporate Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Patrick Lynch for closing remarks."
34,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,34,G. Patrick Lynch,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,I'd just like to thank everybody for participating today and for your interest in NTIC. Hope you have a great week. Thank you.
35,"Northern Technologies International Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,35,Operator,,,"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
