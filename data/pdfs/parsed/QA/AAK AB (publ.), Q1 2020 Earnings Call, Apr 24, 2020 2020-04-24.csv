0,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Carl Mellerby from SEB.
1,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,1,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I have 2, please. With the first one related to food services. I understand that's difficult to estimate, but is it possible to give some type of indication of the expected volume drop that you foresee in Q2, but also for -- yes, for the full year 2020? And then secondly, is it possible to quantify the effect of the cost optimization programs that you have initiated within your Foodservice operations?"
2,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,2,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you for your questions, and I do respect them. At the same time, it is a time of unprecedented uncertainty. So a forecast is just a short picture as of today."
3,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,3,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So what I will try to give you as a guidance is that when we speak about Foodservice, look at the total world and food consumption. Predominantly in the U.S. and focus on the New York area, we have a Foodservice business supplying directly into restaurants and restaurant chains, the same in the U.K., the same in Sweden, reaching the part of the European and more so the North European markets with regards to restaurants and so forth. That demand has been hit dramatically, and I think you can see by looking at other chains what those effects are."
4,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,4,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Then we have the indirect impact as well, where we are not directly selling to what's called Foodservice, but we're selling to a Bakery customer or a Chocolate & Confectionery customer, who, in turn, has the customer within the foodservice sector, and that is also impacted. The rest of the business is consumed through retail, where it seems like the world is really protecting this supply chain in a nice way. So the demand at the moment has dropped dramatically in those sectors."
5,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,5,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And your second question was about the cost optimization. What we are doing is that we are at the moment using the opportunities that are out there. We have operations in Foodservice within Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S., and it looks a bit different with regards to what you can do in the short to midterm perspective. We are using these government supports that are out there, but we're also looking at the outlook."
6,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,6,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And as I mentioned before, we don't see restaurant demand bouncing back in a short week or -- it will perspective rather than only the short-term perspective, and that includes in the midterm perspective also."
7,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,7,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So first of all, looking at the variable costs and our labor costs and so forth. But in the midterm perspective, that would include also productivity improvements and other things we can do, including also delay CapEx investments. But we're not giving any further guidance on that. We are focusing on managing this situation and keeping our operations going at the same time that we are optimizing the structure for certain parts of the business."
8,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,8,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Kenneth Toll from Carnegie.
9,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,9,Kenneth Toll Johansson,"Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. So one question to follow-up on that. Do you have any sense of how much in Bakery, for example, that could go through say, grocery stores, and how much that could go through small cafes and restaurants and bakery shops and so on?"
10,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,10,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In that part, it's -- we are a bit in the dark, but there are ways to estimate. As I said, we are globally -- in a helicopter view, AAK is integrated in the total supply of food or supply to food, whether that is consumed in the retail or through retail or it's consumed through restaurants."
11,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,11,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"To give you a bit of the dynamics that we do have, I mentioned that our direct supply into Foodservice is predominantly the U.S., U.K. and out of Sweden. And then we have -- for those of you who don't know our business, in a country like Turkey, we have a very strong position in Turkey in general, but part of the business we supply and reaching out to all the thousands of artisanal bakeries. And there also lockdown has closed down that part with a hit to short term, but where the rest of the business is going really nicely. And we literally don't know when that will come back."
12,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,12,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So in certain countries, we are more exposed to the direct impact. And in the rest of the world, it is more the indirect impact. But where this is consumed, Kenneth, is really -- think about the fast-food chains in the U.S., in the U.K., in Europe and other parts of the world. Biscuits, cookies, et cetera, that's where we see that indirect hit with regards to bakery and shops."
13,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,13,Kenneth Toll Johansson,"Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Also, you mentioned that you gained some new customers, some infant nutrition products in China being more of the domestic customers. And I would have thought that it take some time before you got into those customers. But you have been successful already now, so to say. So how would you say that -- can you say anything about the split between sort of international companies making infant nutrition products, selling in China and the domestic ones? Or how much more market share is there to gain from domestic ones? Or yes, please address the issue, please?"
14,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,14,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I will address it. So you're right. Over time, yes. So it's -- we don't see it as a direct impact. It is probably slightly boosted with regards to the corona impact. But really, we have a long-term commitment to infant nutrition."
15,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,15,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We are focusing really on our high-end solutions, and China is really the main receiver of high-end solutions with regards to that, whether that is then coming from a multinational or a local customer in"
16,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,16,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"China. And I should say that when we speak about local customers in China, they are big companies, but we call them local because it is really producing in China for China."
17,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,17,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We already have and continue to have a very strong position with multinationals as well as with local customers in China, the big local customers in China. What we have seen and which is positive is that we continue to add new customers."
18,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,18,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So the volume increases that we're staying and we're staying relevant with our current customers, international as well as local, and then we're adding additional ones. And I think it's a result of the continued effort that we have, the solutions that we have, and that's how you should see. It's not a dramatic shift of market share. It's not a dramatic shift of split in the quarter, but it is a good receipt of what we are focusing on."
19,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,19,Kenneth Toll Johansson,"Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then 2 smaller questions. One is that I think you refurbished or had some maintenance in the Danish town for [ shea kernels ] this quarter, and still you managed to increase the EBIT per kilo quite nicely in the quarter. So did you have a significant negative impact from those maintenance works in Q1, in Chocolate..."
20,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,20,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We had. We had, but this is -- this gives you now -- it will not be a normal year. But if it would have been, you would have been having an easy time going forward to see that effect. Now we -- you know from the earlier years how we have been challenged by our situation and the cost that we have had due to lower- yielding kernels and due to investing and increasing the capacity. So of course, the maintenance stop has a negative impact. But at the moment, we are also said we are done with investments. We do have now normal-yielding kernels. So we have a better cost position, a better cost base today when we operate as normal."
21,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,21,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Then we are, of course, dependent on having volume and so forth, the process. So we did have a negative impact of the maintenance stop, but at the same time we have the positive year-over-year impact of the improvements we have been putting in. I think that is what you're seeing. And then in order for that to continue, of course, we are dependent on volumes to continue to come. And short to midterm, corona will have an impact; longer term, we should see the impact of these cost improvements."
22,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,22,Fredrik Nilsson,"CFO, Head of Corporate Communications, Mergers & Acquisitions, IT & Global Foodservice and VP",EXECUTIVES,"And Ken, it's also -- as it was a planned maintenance, we are also secure that we have some inventory at hand so we could ship to the customers during the first quarter."
23,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,23,Kenneth Toll Johansson,"Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then the final small one. I was thinking about your plants, I mean, when we have been visiting them and so on. There aren't that many people around, so to say, as they often is in large process industries. Are you -- how is it around redundancies on key personnel? I'm thinking if there is -- I mean, if you happen to get this coronavirus and develop that disease, you could be gone for a couple of weeks. And if it happens to sort of the wrong employees, yes, is that something you are scared about, that key employees will be turned sick, several of them at the same time, I would say?"
24,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,24,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"It's a good example of one of the first priorities that we attended to put attention to. So one, health and safety of our employees; and two, knowing that we are an important part of the world's food supply chain."
25,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,25,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Exactly those things are what we have in our contingency plans together with the total supply of incoming materials and outbound logistics. So we have put a lot of actions in place in order to secure that our personnel is, first, not getting the coronavirus, but that is hard to avoid at the end of the day. So we have also put contingency plans and actions into place in educating additional employees, but also reaching out to former employees, et cetera, et cetera, to have the backup and the backup."
26,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,26,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So of course, risks are higher today, but we also have very strong contingency plans. And so far, the execution of these have been very successful. So it's not like we have been surfing and nothing has happened. There's been a real significant effort out there, managed really nicely of our employees, so that we do keep running all our plants at the moment."
27,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,27,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from Per Jørgensen from I&T Asset Management.
28,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,28,Per Jørgensen,Investering & Tryghed A/S,ANALYSTS,"Just coming back to the Foodservice business. And if one make a rough assumption that it's about 10% of the volume in the business area that would actually be freed up, so to say, due to lighter volume from the Foodservice business. Will you be able to use that volume to our applications to some -- maybe some interesting spot deals that could come up due to these volatile markets? Or is it still so specialized that you will actually just have to wait for the Foodservice business to come back? That's my first question."
29,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,29,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Per. Yes, it is unfortunately -- I'll come back to that. I think there's a lot of opportunity on the back of this, but not the way it was laid out. So it's rather the latter part of your comment there. We have to wait. But in that waiting, there is, of course, opportunities and how to redirect and so forth. But this is really where we are producing for our customer, like we're producing a barbecue sauce, using all the ingredients that is needed to do a barbecue sauce and do that for a private-label or for a restaurant chain, et cetera, et cetera. So that is separate from our oil refining business."
30,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,30,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"A part of our oils, obviously, go into that, and we can -- we could potentially offset that oil a little bit in the other sector. But really with regards to the end product that we're selling to our customers, it's not possible to shift them, and these production lines are set up for bottling and mixing and blending ingredients into the finished products. But at the same time, with our position and endurance, there might be opportunities around the quarter. But in the short-term perspective, it is really managing a sharp drop in demand, a stop in demand."
31,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,31,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Fair enough. If we take all these customer co-development projects that you have been doing for some time with great success, and we can see that in the results, can you -- are there any delays in companies want you to do some business with you due to this special situation? And are you able to -- your comment about the Plant-based business, is it possible to actually accelerate that business due to everybody is talking about sales and focus on own health and due to this most unfortunate situation?"
32,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,32,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Very relevant question, Per, and I think this is where we need to take the time perspective into account. So with a time perspective, yes, there is a chance that the Plant-based Foods segment and other segments. So we have a focus in our strategy on sustainability -- sustainable solutions, health, nutrition."
33,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,33,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"There is a great chance that coming out of this, that there will be an increased focus on health and nutrition, we don't know yet. But that is, of course, a chance that, that will be accelerated and Plant-based"
34,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,34,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Food can be a carrier of that. It has been a carrier through sustainability a lot, but we all know that health and nutrition is playing into that sector and needs to play into that sector quite a bit. So in the longer- term perspective, I think, yes."
35,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,35,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In the short-term perspective, there is 2 challenges. One is that part of this demand in Plant-based Food is also consumed in the restaurants, right, or quite a lot of it is in fast-food chains and so forth. And then we have the restriction on travel and everything. So some of the co-development actions are a bit more difficult to do today. But we see that we have been increasing our dialogue with customers and being creative about it, staying relevant with our customers. But of course, there is a little bit of difficulties to meet in a lab or so. But there are other ways to do things."
36,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,36,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So we haven't been a dramatic stop. And we are, again, positive about the long-term because with our position and the chance of coming out of this will increased need for co-development projects and reformulations, there is an opportunity there. But at the moment, we have to accept a little bit of pausing in the interaction."
37,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,37,Per Jørgensen,Investering & Tryghed A/S,ANALYSTS,"Yes. Okay. Fair enough. And then just briefly, Johan, your comment on M&A, and now we have done this in Russia. Should one not expect that it could be maybe also paused due to all this different market? Or do you see a possible actually to accelerate your M&A agenda due to maybe sell-offs being more inclined to serve companies? How should we read that in your business?"
38,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,38,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I think the only -- how to read is basically with our financial position and our current view on the future, we see that we have a strong position, we have a strong balance sheet. And even with a bump on the road or even a slightly bigger bump on the road than we might have thought, we would still be, as we see it, profitable. We still have a strong P&L and balance sheet. So with that, we would be able to continue to do M&A, and there might be opportunities around the corner."
39,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,39,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Of course, we are cautious about our CapEx spend. We're cautious about our cash flow in times like this. But we do have a strong position, and we are prepared to act on opportunities. And we continue to -- we continue our M&A portfolio management through this, but it's a bit up to also the opportunities to come through, right?"
40,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,40,Per Jørgensen,Investering & Tryghed A/S,ANALYSTS,Okay. So this has not changed...
41,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,41,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We are ready to act. But whether the targets will be out there or not, that's a difficult one to see at the moment."
42,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,42,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Oskar Lindstrom from Danske Bank.
43,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,43,Oskar Lindstrom,"Danske Bank A/S, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A couple of questions from me. First of all, I mean, could you -- given the sort of impact this is having on Foodservice, is there any possibility you could share with us sort of the size of your Foodservice business as part of your sales?"
44,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,44,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We have decided and we actively don't micro guide on specific subsegments, and we need to stand by that. And in times like this, the most important thing we have in front of us is to manage the business and manage the actions and get out stronger. So we'll stay with that."
45,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,45,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"There are some historic numbers that one could look at and there are also the total -- if you look at the total world and how much is consumed in restaurants, how much is normally consumed through retail, you can get a good picture because that we are operating, we're selling to the -- in the world of food, and that includes the direct or indirect sales to Foodservice, but it includes also the direct sales that go into retail. And that's where we are."
46,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,46,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"But we do see, as we said, a dramatic drop in the Foodservice direct. But also keep in mind that there is an indirect impact on Bakery products, on Chocolate & Confectionery products. So also these segments we do expect get a hit in the short to midterm. So the base business, the refining business is also impacted. And specific countries where it is more present, it's Turkey, as I mentioned, it is U.S., Sweden, the U.K. And then we have -- apart from Foodservice because it's not only Foodservice, I think it's important to keep in mind that we have a situation with lockdowns, with restrictions."
47,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,47,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The sum of customer stopping for a week, another customer stopping for a week, a short disruption in India and so forth. And so the sum of this adds up to an impact, negative impact on our earnings. But at the same time, in a longer perspective, it's more like a bump on the road. But it is important to keep in mind that we are not immune. It's not like everything is going through retail and everything is just a sunny ride, that's not how it is. But we stand strong, but we do expect Q2, Q3 to be challenged on our earnings due to these things."
48,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,48,Oskar Lindstrom,"Danske Bank A/S, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. All right. Another question. I mean in the Chocolate & Confectionery segment, you talked about down-trading, as I understood it, among your customers, but -- I guess, with the end users. Could you explain a little bit, first of all, how that would look? I mean is it you selling less? Or are you selling less-profitable products? And then the second part of that question is, how much of this have you seen already? Or is it more something that you're expecting?"
49,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,49,Oskar Lindstrom,"Danske Bank A/S, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then the final part of that question, to what extent is this connected to currency devaluations or weaker currencies in a number of emerging markets that people sort of no longer can afford more expensive products? So quite a wide question there, but you get the..."
50,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,50,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"No, but you covered the elements. So I'll take them in that order. We can even start backwards from currency. Yes, because somehow part of our volume and also profitable volume is going through countries like Turkey, like Russia. Russia is one of the biggest chocolate and confectionery markets out there. So in countries like Russia and Turkey, yes, currency has an impact."
51,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,51,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And staying with that, so as we go to demand through Eastern Europe, Western Asia, call it Russia and neighboring countries, that's where we see and expect. So yes, we haven't seen a lot of it, but we do expect going forward that down-trading. There is a risk for the down-trading to happen. And that is when you have countries where consumers start seeing an impact. You see our customers down-trading using others. So you're right, not that much less volume maybe, but less high-end solutions and in that less- profitable product for us to sell. So downgrading a little bit, adjusting what they are using and selling."
52,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,52,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And we also have some of these volumes going from Eastern Europe and Western Asia into China and other countries, and we have seen some impact from the corona in the demand there. So some of the large chocolate markets, we do see an FX effect. We do see a -- we expect an FX effect and we expect a down-trading effect."
53,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,53,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In many other cases, we are still as strong as before. Chocolate is also in the part of the world where we"
54,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,54,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"-- even in a time like this when you still have money to spend, chocolate is also part of comfort food and comfort snacking. So there is a bit of a balancing trend as well. But net-net, we do see more downside risk than upside risk. But that's typically what we see in other downturns. This one is a bit unique, unprecedented. So need to be cognizant of the risk. But typically, you see it as a comfort food, but also you can see down-trading."
55,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,55,Oskar Lindstrom,"Danske Bank A/S, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then just a final question, if I may, coming back to the infant nutrition question, which figured quite a lot in your Q3 and Q4 this conference calls. I mean do you now feel that you're -- I mean is the situation improving or more coasting along and you're managing with this shift? How should we interpret the comment that you made about gaining some local customers? Taking that market share, basically."
56,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,56,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Call it going from a slight downward trend to plateauing, coasting a bit, to use your word, is probably a good representation of the current situation. So we have seen with the dramatic drop in birth rates in"
57,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,57,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"China, the total end consumer demand was really hit. We are still, through this, have a strong -- we have maintained a strong position with our customer, but really the demand has been reduced. But now with adding a few customers and being in a strong position, being able to supply. We have also been one of the go-to players where customers really trust us to be able to supply through the corona pandemic and so forth. So the combination of maybe plateauing in a bit with regards to end demand with birth rates and then us taking a bit of market share."
58,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,58,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,And do you think there's been a lot of inventory building among your customers or perhaps end users of infant formula? And that we could see some kind of a big backlash in volumes later in the year? Or...
59,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,59,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The information we have at hand and we keep a tight dialogue is that it's not massive. I think we should be cognizant, we are at least, and I'm guiding a bit on this. I think in times like this, there is a risk for both stocking and destocking. Specifically to infant nutrition, these products typically don't have a long shelf life in the hands of the mothers and fathers for any consumer usage, but a bit longer shelf life for our customers."
60,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,60,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So there is a bit of dynamic there. But so far, we haven't seen a dramatic stocking impact. But there's a bit of risk, that is, in some of that. But also given the last 6 weeks, I also think that, in general, for the whole demand, I also think that there is a risk that every person buying something and managing an MRP system is -- some will do some stocking to safeguard and save, other will do destocking to save cash and balance sheet. So there is volatility, is probably the right word to use."
61,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,61,Operator,,,We have a question from James Targett from Berenberg.
62,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,62,James Targett,"Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A couple of sort of clarification questions from me. Just firstly on Foodservice, you commented in the release that the volumes halved in Foodservice. I just wanted to check, was that the exit rate in March? And if so, kind of how long had -- how long for the quarter had volumes been down by that amount? And then in India, you mentioned some temporary production stoppages, but it's still affecting Q2. So I just wanted to clarify, in India, are you back up and running there? And how big India is again for the AAK Group?"
63,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,63,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So with regards to the latter part of Q1 or we should actually say the latter part of March, that is when it really happened. So it's literally a couple of weeks in Q1 where we saw a dramatic Foodservice drop. So it's not a large part of Q1, but it is definitely a rock bottom start of Q2 and forward."
64,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,64,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And then with regards to India, it's a quite big part of AAK Asia. It's the largest plant that we have in AAK in Asia. And when we speak about the disturbances and [ scatter ] one, so we were impacted just a little bit. But it's more important the total impact that we have from customers. So the way India locked down and the way restrictions are put in India, we have seen more so in India and Latin America that we have, in 1 week, difficulties getting operators in and operating."
65,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,65,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And then we are -- so yes, we are up and running, but then we see customers shutting down or reducing volume and a bit different dynamics in terms of demand patterns. So call it, a bit more chaotic and more disruptions compared to Europe, Europe -- sorry, Europe and U.S. And the same thing in little bit in Southern Latin America, where countries like Brazil, Argentina and so forth. We are up and running. We have a good contingency plan, but we do see customers for different reasons shutting down a week, shutting down 2 weeks. So more uncertainty and volatility in these markets."
66,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,66,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you. And as there appear to be no further questions, I'll return the conference to you."
67,"AAK AB (publ.), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,67,Johan Westman,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"All right. Thank you very much, and thank you for listening. I'll repeat that unprecedented -- an unprecedented situation is what we're in as a company, a bit grateful to be part of the global food supply chain and prioritized sector. So AAK, we stand strong. We stand strong financially. But we are not immune, we're also impacted. Short to midterm, there will be bumps on the road, there will be an impact on our earnings. But at the same time, in a long-term perspective, we do see still favorable underlying trends with regards to plant-based oils and fats going forward. With that, I'd like to thank everyone for calling in. Stay safe. Thank you."
