0,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Justin Long.
1,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,1,Justin Trennon Long,"Stephens Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Maybe to start just bigger picture on the industry and what you're anticipating from a railcar production standpoint, FTR has recently lowered their forecast for 2020 and 2021 to that kind of low to mid-20,000 unit range. I'm curious. As you think about kind of cutting back your capacity and some of the things you discussed in the prepared remarks, is that the type of build rate from an industry perspective that you're planning on? Or do you anticipate any upside or downside to that? And then also if you could just talk about cancellation risk in the backlog or deferral risk in the backlog. Curious if you've seen any of that play out in the last month or so."
2,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,2,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So I'll start out, and I'm sure that Bill will supplement. From an industry outlook perspective, FTR certainly has gone through several iterations of dropping expected deliveries in 2020 and 2021. Right now, with everything that's going on, I think it is really hard to say specifically what deliveries might look like the next couple of years. I think it certainly is reasonable that the numbers that they're projecting might be the numbers as you look across the years."
3,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,3,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Absolutely, there is upside. We've seen that historically in our markets where we can be predicting that the sky is falling, and then the next thing, something wonderful happens. That's one of the things that we believe our management team and our manufacturing group, in particular, is very good at is being responsive to when opportunities present themselves."
4,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,4,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Our commercial team is very focused on working closely with our customers and remaining flexible so that we can take advantage of those opportunities. So that's why you see us slowing production as opposed to stopping it all together. If we can continue it at a fairly slow rate, we think that gives us optionality."
5,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,5,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And then turning to your second question about risk in the backlog, we -- as we've poured through the backlog and looking at the different car types that we're building, and it is a broad variety of car types, at this point in time, we don't have anything that we're overly concerned about. But then again, how can you work in this point in time and not be overly concerned about something."
6,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,6,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"I think we have a good history of working closely with our customers if there is an issue that they raise or a concern that we may need to modify car types or look at delivery timing. But again, at this point in time, we're feeling like our backlog is a very solid position and a good indicator of future activity."
7,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,7,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The only thing I would add, and thank you for your question, is that, obviously, we've had a number of things occur. Lorie mentioned a few. But the oil market volatility is of concern, not only for the petrochemical and oil by rail business but -- and while Greenbrier doesn't have a strong sand concentration, many of our investors, institutional investors, only managed cars due. So we're very focused on that. But we're not seeing cancellations in the sense that you mean it. They're -- obviously, the qualitative aspects of the portfolio is another thing. But I think the kind of nimbleness our commercial team showed in this deal that was done to work with a customer to not only improve our backlog but improve our profitability and drive immediate cash flow is something that we'll try to do more of in the future. And we have great customers. We think things are going to -- on the back -- backlog is the strongest thing we've got plus the fact we can operate our factories under the essential service rules."
8,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,8,Justin Trennon Long,"Stephens Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's really helpful. And then second question I had was on SG&A. I get the suspension of guidance totally understandable in this type of environment. But when you look at the things you can control and you think about some of the headcount reductions that you've seen, is there any clarity you can give us on what you're expecting for SG&A this year? What's getting baked into the comment that you may build that you expect to remain profitable?"
9,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,9,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Lorie, you should address that. I think we want to be cautious about throwing numbers out there. As I said, we expect to be profitable. Manufacturing operations are particularly resilient. We do expect to have G&A instructions in all categories -- G&A reductions, I mean. It's not just going to be factory people. We already have had -- and I don't think -- I don't know what you would like to say about it, Lorie."
10,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,10,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Bill. That was a good lead-in. We are looking across the board. We don't take lightly the number of production workers that we've had to let go over the last 6 months. So I would say, while we're not willing to put a specific target out there since we are suspending guidance, I would say that it's going to be -- double-digit percentage reduction is going to be the goal in our SG&A, coupled with looking at overhead costs, which are some of the things that oftentimes can get overlooked. But as we're resizing our manufacturing footprint, particularly here in North America, there are overhead types of activities that can also be scaled down. So that's where we're pleased that our manufacturing margins have remained in the double digits. And we believe that's because we do know how to scale our workforce, both the line workers as well as the overhead, to adjust to reduced production rates. And you will be seeing some reductions in SG&A head count as well as some of the other things that Bill mentioned regarding his compensation, the Board's compensation. Clearly, travel restrictions, the way that they've played out, that's going to have a big impact on SG&A going forward. We have a hiring freeze, and we'll be looking at other areas where we can call back some costs."
11,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,11,Operator,,,Next question comes from Allison Poliniak.
12,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,12,Allison Poliniak-Cusic,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Lorie, I just want to follow on that train of thought. Obviously, you guys were addressing operations to begin with, trying to fix and support some of them. As you step back, I know it's probably hard today because you're just dealing with the general sort of impact on a daily basis. But can you maybe comment in terms of what you think you can do structurally to support the foundation that make Greenbrier, obviously, much stronger coming out of this? I mean, are you guys even thinking of that at this point?"
13,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,13,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Absolutely. We're thinking about when we come out of this COVID-19 -- focus right now, trying to make particularly our core operations and manufacturing and our commercial group a lot stronger. I think one of the very interesting things about the pandemic is it is forcing us to rethink how we work. If you -- and I think you've been here in our offices in Lake Oswego, Allison. It's really amazing how much of our services we can continue while probably 90% of our workforce telecommute. So I think that will be a foundation for how we think about what is going to be our core to support our operations, whether it's the folks that we have down in Dallas, the folks that we have here in the Portland metropolitan area or even our workforce in St. Charles to rethink how do we use technology to build on having a solid base to support our operations and really thinking how do we make certain that we've got the best and the brightest supporting that. And maybe there are some costs that we were going to realize that we don't have to continue to incur."
14,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,14,Allison Poliniak-Cusic,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. And then just -- I know you touched on Europe, obviously, closing for 2 weeks there. Any color on Brazil? I guess it wasn't clear to me because we've heard some industry shutting down in Brazil today. Is there sort of a slowdown or a stoppage there that you guys are preparing for near term? Or is that just business as usual in this environment, I guess?"
15,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,15,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Right. And yes, business as usual to the extent that you can today. It is one of the more interesting things because we do operate around the globe. Every country seems to have a different approach, and those approaches can change on a daily basis. As I understand it today, our operations in Brazil do continue to operate, and the government officials do encourage our employees to go to work. That would probably be one of the places that we started implementing additional health screening measures early on. Touch wood, everything has been going just fine down there, but we'll just continue to monitor that. We believe that we have good governmental support. The transportation via the rail will be an essential service, and our workers will continue to work."
16,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,16,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"As you know, we rightsized that operation last year. So they are able to operate with a fairly thin bench. And their production rates are a bit more modest than you would see here in North America. So we'll just have to watch and..."
17,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,17,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I'd just like to emphasize that the U.S. relationship with Brazil, the current administration has shown a great deal of interest in Brazil. Most of the countries in the world are following U.S. and Western -- we, on essential industries, it is an essential industry in Brazil so much of their exports and their economy relies in transportation. We're the largest builder of the equipment we build in Brazil. So I think Brazil and Europe, we expect those rules to continue in place, and we're working with -- diplomatically with our own government to encourage that to occur."
18,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,18,Operator,,,Next question comes from Bascome Majors.
19,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,19,Bascome Majors,"Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. I wanted to talk a little bit about the syndication channel. That's been a really important piece of your growth over the last several years, and it's pretty embedded in the model now. Can you give us an indication of how some of these financial buyer customers of yours are responding here? And any indication of how much of the backlog today was sort of slated for that channel?"
20,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,20,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Bascome. I'll let Lorie or Adrian possibly address the last question. In general, we still see a strong distribution network there. I think it's an interesting question because the railcar leasing business is peculiar. It's a business that we have evolved to be in the leasing business. We can create portfolios at will, and we can also sell them in effect."
21,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,21,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I don't believe personally in borrowing short and lending long on a 40-year asset. These assets, as Tiger Air learned long ago in North American Car, can come back to haunt you. And they can sink a ship. Our system is set up so that we attach leases that are quality leases. And those leases can be deployed to"
22,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,22,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Yes.
23,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,23,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Chairman & CEO create cash flow, and as you point out, to create cash, margins, liquidity and extra value in the model we have."
24,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,24,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"As late as last week, we just closed a $48 million deal with a -- one of our existing portfolio companies, a leasing portfolio of companies that is a loyal customer. All of our customers who have multiyear agreements, including leasing companies with whom we work closely, are fulfilling their obligations. So I think that we are in good shape there."
25,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,25,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"If we were relying on the ABS market or something of that nature, and where we have partners who are in the fund business, they have firm commitments and no ability to have their funds pulled. If we were solely in that market, I think it would be much weaker position, but we have a mixed bag. We're still accepting orders. And we think we're doing well. Lorie, you want to talk a little bit more about that?"
26,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,26,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. And just doing a quick scan of our backlog detail, I would say, of our Feb 29 backlog, probably less than 10% of it is going into the syndication market at this point in time."
27,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,27,Bascome Majors,"Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. That's great news. So it sounds like some of the build in that inventory was sold subsequent to quarter end and the $50 million deal you mentioned, Bill. Am I hearing that right?"
28,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,28,Bascome Majors,"Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Right. And Bascome, as you know, when you look at that line item on our balance sheet, railcars held for syndication, if you were to do some sort of a trend line over it for the last, I don't know, 8 to 12 quarters, it does go move up and down. Not necessarily an indication of anything that's going on in that particular market, but oftentimes, it's more a result of when the cars are being produced and as we're packaging a variety of different car types together to put together those syndication packages."
29,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,29,Bascome Majors,"Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And again, the majority of those are attached to what in a normal market would be money good leases. We could syndicate, sell them and receive a margin just for the origination of the -- today, those are good customers. And they have good 5- to 7-year, even 10-year or 8-year cash flows attached. So we're simply in the leasing business but in a moderate way."
30,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,30,Bascome Majors,"Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I'll also point out that our balance sheet, with that embedded in it, it still has a 1:1 debt equity ratio. We have $1.5 billion in net book value equity sitting beside our market cap. We also have the -- a very low amount of debt, I guess at about $1 billion or so. So I think if you look at the leasing portfolio, in the future, we're going to have more clarity for The Street and for our shareholders. We're going to still continue to try to make this more transparent and clearer. The attractiveness of our system in downturn like this is far and away above those who have these leases in returning rapid -- rapidly in rapid amounts."
31,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,31,Bascome Majors,"Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Thank you for that detailed answer. If I could just tack on a related question on the funding side of that. Bill, you mentioned in short order, hoping to have access to $1 billion worth of liquidity. I think you said today, you're at about $600 million. Can you just give us maybe a sneak peek at what you think that other $400 million could look like?"
32,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,32,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I'm going to let Lorie walk through that. Unless you want me to take that, Lorie? I could generally make some comments, CapEx and..."
33,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,33,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"No. I would say I'll -- thanks, Bill, and I'm sure that you'll supplement or Adrian can as well or Justin, our Treasurer. We've all been up to our eyeballs in thinking about all the various ways that we can look towards liquidity in this time of uncertainty."
34,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,34,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"So CapEx is one of the more significant items that we had already been thinking about putting on the brakes -- we're putting on the brakes a lot harder. If you look at what we were thinking we would do as we enter this fiscal year versus where we're saying we're going to be now, and even at that, I would suspect that our CapEx can come down further from what we're showing in the 10-Q when it gets filed later today or if you're looking at the supplemental slides."
35,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,35,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And I don't expect that when we hit August 31, it's just going to -- we're going to flip a switch and go back to business as usual. I think that we're going to be focused on really making certain that we're deploying capital in the best way possible from a capital -- from a property, plant and equipment perspective for a time to come."
36,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,36,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Additionally, like we talked about, there would be overhead and G&A reductions. I would say that could be probably nearly as much as what we're expecting in the CapEx reductions. Some of that will take a little bit of time to get momentum. We are seeing our spending levels being lower in the first half of -- actually this fiscal year isn't what we were initially anticipating. Again, a lot of that comes as we were making adjustments to reduced production rates and lower demand."
37,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,37,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And the other things that we'll be looking at are what I consider strategic initiatives, and some of that is looking at our existing credit facilities and figuring out there are a couple of avenues where we can access additional capital under our existing credit facility. So these are not amendments. These are not going out for new debt. This is just utilizing what we currently have at our fingertips as well as evaluating our operating base."
38,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,38,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And that particular bucket would be fairly sizable, $100 million, $150 million, for example. There's a number of these things. We don't have -- we're not talking about tapping the credit markets in any at a financing other than maybe some top-off financing if we find a good deal. So if you look at all of these things, we're -- theoretically, it should be able to go over $1 billion. But the strategic aspects of noncore businesses, cutting costs, conserving cash, it all starts mounting up pretty quickly. So we think the target is realistic and achievable in the next 5 months of this year."
39,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,39,Operator,,,Next question comes from Ken Hoexter.
40,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,40,Kenneth Scott Hoexter,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. Just can you talk maybe, Lorie, about base levels of production given your contracts? Usually, you see a bounce in the second half. Is that production line capabilities or demand for car types that scale in the second half? I guess you got to go back to maybe 2013 before we saw real weakness in that fiscal third quarter. So I guess what I'm asking is if the backlog is so strong and ops are ongoing, what do you need to slash? Does the backlog have greater deferrals than you target? Can you cancel your own self orders? But that kind of doesn't make sense if you noted all slots were filled for production. So maybe just talk about how we should think about that railcar build going into the rest of the year."
41,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,41,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. And we have been, as we said, reducing production rates. I would say right now in North America, we're probably maybe 75% of our theoretical capacity is where we're operating. We would see that coming down maybe another 5% or 10% as we exit the fiscal year. And that's knowing what we know today."
42,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,42,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Obviously, there's a number of things that can change. We don't believe that we've got any significant issues with any of our scheduled production or any of our customers looking to defer that further. Matter of fact, we have some customers who are pretty excited to accelerate production, but we're trying to balance that with our workforce. We don't want to let people go and then pull them back and then let them go again."
43,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,43,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"One of the ways that we're able to maintain good manufacturing margin is having setting production rates and a steady workforce. So as we look at the rest of the year, we're looking at things like reducing where we were running on 3 shifts at some of our facilities and pulling that back to running just 2 shifts, maybe working 4 days instead of 5 or 6 days a week. Those are the kinds of measures that our manufacturing team is looking at to balance our headcount with the production rates."
44,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,44,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And again, as you think about it, we do have strong backlog, but overall demand has subsided. And we want to make certain that we are appropriately pacing our production to meet our customers' needs but also to take us through the next 1.5 years or so."
45,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,45,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Unfortunately, if you look at that production, you've got to increase inventories. We're going to constrict inventories. We'd like to pace things, as Lorie said. If you take a step back, a couple of steps back, though, and you see the government policy as it sorts out at different levels, it's quite clear what the intent is, keep people home, break the back of the virus level of curve. We hear all those things, but I'm not so sure everybody understands why they're doing it, what the end game is. There are various scenarios, of course, as we hit the peak in this, but they're basically trying to push this down to maintain our hospital and capabilities to deal with the patients."
46,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,46,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"There will be, therefore, an effort to return to normalcy. And already you're seeing in Europe, and we have the benefit of that vision from 2 or 3 months ago, what happens if there is success. Even Italy is having some now green shoots as reported this morning. So I think that if you look at what's going on here, you can have more comfort that there might be a return to normalcy or closer -- something closer back for some of the things that we normally see at the end of -- by the last 2 quarters of our fiscal year. We're not expecting that. We're managing for cash, and our resolve is very firm. We're looking to protect the downside and hope -- very hopeful, very hopeful for the upside, and we'll be willing and capable of responding to it when it comes, and it will come."
47,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,47,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I guess what I'm just confused by the answer, maybe just to clarify it a little bit more, is if every slot is filled and nothing has changed on that, what changes on the second half, right? Because you've said every production slot is filled. Is it that you are slowing down because customers don't want it?"
48,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,48,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Lorie said it seems -- right. Let me interrupt you just for a moment. Just say what Lorie's saying -- I think what I'm saying is every slot is filled, but we're reducing the flow-through so we can reduce our overhead and we can optimize cash. So this is something we are working with our customers to do. And I don't think the last 2 quarters of this year will be necessarily following a pattern of the last few years. At least that's a simple answer to, I think, your question."
49,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,49,Kenneth Scott Hoexter,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"No. That makes a lot -- that makes sense. Again, I appreciate that."
50,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,50,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,We're doing this as -- we're self-imposing a lot of this ourselves.
51,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,51,Kenneth Scott Hoexter,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. No, no. I get it, slowing production. And then Lorie, just to clarify on what you were talking with Bascome about the leased railcars for syndication. Does that mean you're keeping more of what you build? Or I just want to understand the temporary view of what Bill said was the $50 million sale. Is that just you had some extra at the end of the quarter and then you sold them? Or I just want to understand -- or are you building more because you said the backlog wasn't that great in terms of what you're keeping? But it looks like with those lease railcars for syndication on the balance sheet jumped up. So is that temporary keeping more of what you build?"
52,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,52,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Right. So again, what I was trying to say to Bascome, and thanks for the question, is the timing of syndication is not necessarily linear. And so as you look at the February balance sheet, it had a higher- than-normal value and number of units in railcar sales for syndication."
53,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,53,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"What Bill was referencing is something that happened in March, meaning that the syndication and our partners are still open for business. And some of that moved off of our balance sheet in the month of March. We expect that to continue."
54,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,54,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"To the question about how much is in our backlog associated with leases that we expect to syndicate, that being a fairly small number, I think what you're seeing is what has been happening over the last 6 months, where lease originations have flowed. It's not that we're expecting to keep those on our balance sheet. It's just that side of the market slowed down a little bit, consistent with the broader demand for new railcars."
55,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,55,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"In our scenarios, I anticipate that we may have to keep a large amount on our balance sheet, and that's why we think we need the extra capital."
56,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,56,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,Our downside scenarios.
57,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,57,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Our downside scenarios. And we did, post-quarter, do a lot more in clearing syndications and assets a lot, much more than the $48 million. That was a single deal. We did..."
58,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,58,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer 2 or 3."
59,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,59,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Chairman & CEO 2 or 3 times that, I imagine. 2 or 3 other big deals. And so the market is still open to us. And I think the terms are changing. Profitability might change, but we think we've got a good handle on that. And that is, however -- that is the other big risk that we are managing besides keeping our factories running under the protection that we have and other car builders may have as essential industries."
60,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,60,Kenneth Scott Hoexter,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just to underline what Bill said earlier, again, even if these assets stay on the balance sheet, they are generating lease income."
61,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,61,Kenneth Scott Hoexter,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. No, I appreciate all the answers and time. If I could just get one housekeeping, Justin, what's the marine backlog for the quarter?"
62,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,62,Justin M. Roberts,VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"It was probably around, I think, $60 million to $70 million."
63,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,63,Adrian J. Downes,"Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer",EXECUTIVES,I think it was $59 million or $60 million.
64,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,64,Justin M. Roberts,VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,Yes. So about $60 million.
65,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,65,Operator,,,Next question comes from Steve Barger.
66,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,66,Robert Stephen Barger,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Understandable why you would want to reduce capacity. But how did you decide which plants to close? And I'm specifically thinking about seeing more of the reductions coming from the lower-cost Mexican on the U.S. to avoid potential border issues?
67,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,67,Robert Stephen Barger,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Partly the second one. But mainly, it was the product mix. The big hit was the general-type cars hit in plant -- our Plant 2 in Sahagun in Hidalgo, the State of Hidalgo. Our joint venture plant has a very good specialization in tank cars. We produce tank cars at our Plant 3, which is Tlaxcala -- State of Tlaxcala in Tlaxcala -- the city is Tlaxcala. So I think it was more selected product mix coupled with, at the time, some concerns about moving a bit more to the U.S. footprint and testing the efficiency of the ARI facilities. And they are reasonably efficient. But it is true that the Mexican base in normal circumstances is in a very, very efficient base. And we expect when normalcy returns to go back to business as usual in all 3 factories in Mexico."
68,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,68,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"And I would say at this point, we are not having any significant supply chain issues for the North American market. We had actually planned ahead as many companies do before the Lunar New Year and had stocked up on inventory that we would have been getting elsewhere. The essential business that we're operating under actually impacts our suppliers as well, so we've been able to maintain the supply chain. The one exception is a little bit in Europe where that part of what led to a 2-week closure for the year, an extended Easter holiday, is to allow the supply chain to get caught up. They do transport more via the roads versus on the rails. And I'm sure everyone saw the pictures as borders were shut, and they -- it took a little bit of time for them to figure out how to expedite the transportation of some of those supplies across border."
69,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,69,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"It's really important to understand what happened in Europe and compare it here. You can imagine what would occur at interstate commerce if each state put up roadblocks and barriers and delayed interstate commerce from one state to another, or in the case of Europe, from one city to the other."
70,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,70,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In Italy, for example, the individual accounts are -- have blockades. You can't go in. You can't go out. But we don't -- haven't come to that in America yet. We're prepared, if it were to come, to deal in that environment. And we've issued credentials to all of our essential employees so that they can continue business operating as an essential U.S. industry. And we believe our supply chain is through the railroad system. This is a great advantage of rail. And it's a spectacular advantage of rail because they don't have to stop at the borders, and they're protected. This is a very big thing to understand. It's going to give us a real hit in the rail sector in Europe in a sense of a heavy uplift. So I think that's kind of a silver lining in this cloud. We don't hope -- we hope that this is not going to occur in America, but it could. And if it happens, we're ready for it, and the rail is going to be the solution."
71,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,71,Robert Stephen Barger,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That's great color. And just to the point on the mix for the south of the border facilities, how should we think about modeling minority interest in the back half? Will you see lower production from GIMSA?"
72,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,72,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I would suspect if you wanted to model, and we're not giving guidance, but I think one of the things you might notice in our press release today is minority interest was a bit lower than normal. That is tied into the timing of railcar syndications. So less of the GIMSA joint venture, up in revenue and gross margin, therefore, less going out as our partners share. I would expect that to turn to be more normalized like in the first quarter for the next couple of quarters as the syndications work their way out."
73,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,73,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"However, can I just make one comment? We are working with our partner there given these special circumstances to correct that imbalance. And if we succeed in reaching an accord, I think we'll have an uplift to that category. So all of Lorie's comments, we may have a more favorable picture. And that's a bucket of cash that we expect we might be able to also obtain in that relationship, that we have a very supportive partner there. I'm really pleased with their cooperation. So it's a source of cash. And I think we'll see -- I'm pretty positive we'll have some good news to announce on that. We'll probably -- we'll be very transparent when we finish it, too."
74,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,74,Robert Stephen Barger,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And just for clarity around liquidity and cash flow. You've given a lot of detail around being able to generate cash savings from the actions you're taking. And -- but as you think about production expectations, managing working capital, timing of syndication activity, do you expect positive operating cash flow this year?"
75,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,75,Justin M. Roberts,VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,Yes.
76,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,76,Justin M. Roberts,VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, we do."
77,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,77,Robert Stephen Barger,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And with lower CapEx, will you generate free cash flow this year?"
78,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,78,Justin M. Roberts,VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"I would say that we feel pretty confident that we'll be -- I think at this point, based on what we see, that is a strong possibility. Again, borrowing Bill's phrase, we don't know what we don't know at this point. And -- but from what we see as the lay of the land, currently, that's the plan that we're working towards."
79,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,79,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The great thing, if you can operate your factories, is that this kind of business throws off cash flow as you liquidate inventories. Normally, in normal cycle, you wouldn't have this issue with cash because you throw off a lot of cash. So it should be positive. However, if you can't operate your factories, which is the situation many companies are in, then you can't run it up, and everything is on its -- turned upside down. We expect to keep our factories operating safely, and that's a core risk or threat we're managing."
80,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,80,Operator,,,Last question comes from Matt Elkott.
81,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,81,Matthew Youssef Elkott,Research Division,ANALYSTS,"Once we've made it out of this pandemic and it's well in the rearview mirror, are we looking at a manufacturing footprint that is adjusted and rightsized on a permanent basis, meaning total production output less than pre-pandemic levels?"
82,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,82,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We would call it optimized. Yes. We're optimizing our total footprint for the expected market longer term. We have a great franchise. We have great markets. We simply need to prune the tree a bit. And we need to look very, very hard in the strategic bucket that Lorie is talking about, about noncore, nonessential businesses to Greenbrier, not nonessential in the nature of the business, but those businesses that aren't central to our new footprint. It's just time to prune the tree, create cash, run the company for cash, improve shareholder value over the immediate future."
83,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,83,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I might remind you that after the Great Depression or the last pandemic of this scale after World War I, the Great War, everybody came back. They had great casualty rate from that. And then came the roaring '20s. So with people housebound and unable to buy, once they get out, they're going to be shopping, I think. At least some of them will. Many of them that I know will."
84,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,84,Matthew Youssef Elkott,Research Division,ANALYSTS,"Yes. That's helpful. Thought I'd know. And also I just wanted to make sure I understood something on the cadence and deliveries. I know you guys removed for a fee some cars from -- for the backlog that was supposed to be delivered in future periods. Historically, your second half deliveries are higher than your first half deliveries at least in the last couple of fiscal years. Now given the fact that it seems like you guys are not currently engaged in any further conversations about further cancellations or deferments, will the second half deliveries be higher than the first half deliveries if no more cancellations occur?"
85,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,85,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"I think that's a good estimation is that the second half would be stronger than the first half on a deliveries perspective. Some of it is just again the timing of syndications and the stuff that's on the balance sheet, which will flow through and be counted as a delivery in the second half. That will offset some of the production reductions that we're doing. But all in, I would say, at least what we know today, second half deliveries, possibly a little bit stronger than first half. Some of that being driven by international operations, not necessarily North American operations."
86,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,86,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"So -- and again, this is part of why we are suspending guidance is every day brings new activities. And by new activities, I don't mean conversations with customers about potential cancellations, but edicts by government and municipalities and that creating a stir and stress on workforce and whether or not people can go to work, et cetera, et cetera. We feel very comfortable and strongly that we are an essential business, and we will continue to operate, but that doesn't mean that we're not a little bit less efficient as you continue to deal with some of the unavoidable stress associated with this pandemic."
87,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,87,Matthew Youssef Elkott,Research Division,ANALYSTS,"Got it. So you mentioned, Lorie, the international deliveries. So when all this is said and done, when you -- are we likely to look back and say that the fact that you're the only North American manufacturer with significant international operations helped you kind of soften or mitigate the blow of the apex given the rolling infection apexes around the world? So if one place is in lockdown, another place may not be. So is that going to, you think, play to your advantage when this is all said and done?"
88,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,88,Matthew Youssef Elkott,Research Division,ANALYSTS,"I would say that our strategy of expanding our footprint internationally absolutely is going to help us be a stronger and more resilient and more liquid entity going forward. Unfortunately, it's not like you can shift production out of, let's say, the United States down to Brazil to bring back to the United States, so -- but we do think having manufacturing and rail freight presence in some of these markets that we believe will be very strong markets for railcar production and freight loadings. So Brazil and Europe does make us a stronger company going forward."
89,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,89,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,Of course.
90,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,90,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Can I just give an example of that, Lorie?"
91,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,91,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In Europe, the difference is post crisis that favor rail aren't going to be dramatic because of the issues with border crossings they've had, and that's quite clear. But there already is a very healthy green movement and a very large investment in rail in the billions to take traffic away from choked highway and other business. So this is going to be very positive for Europe. Brazil, similarly has those kinds of forces going on. So I think that diversification, as Europe comes out of this earlier than we do, will help Greenbrier a very great deal."
92,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,92,Matthew Youssef Elkott,Research Division,ANALYSTS,"Got it. And just one final question, Bill, related to what you were just explaining. In past recessions, you guys dealt with losses in the Great Recession and I think in 2013. Can you maybe summarize for us how Greenbrier is different today than it was in 2013 and then during the Great Recession?"
93,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,93,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. I'll take a shot at it, and Lorie can add. But basically, our product mix is dramatically different. Our industry leadership is different. We have a spectacularly different franchise #1 or #2 in 3 major markets, 2 internationally."
94,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,94,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"North America, we've diversified our footprint to have more optionality in the United States. We have some efficient plans for getting those knocked into shape, and they're making progress every quarter in Arkansas. So I think the company is dramatically different than it was."
95,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,95,William A. Furman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Our management team is together. It's experienced. Lorie and the financial team are doing a great job, but Lorie is also getting a great deal of experience in operations, turned around a lot of -- some of the last year's issues. And I think the company is really on a very solid strategic footing at this point. We have to get through this crisis like everybody else."
96,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,96,Justin M. Roberts,VP of Corporate Finance & Treasurer,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you very much, everyone, for your time today and your attention. If you have any other questions, you can reach out to myself, Justin, or Adrian Downes or Lorie, and we also have the Investor Relations e- mail address on our website as well. Thank you, and stay safe and healthy out there."
97,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,97,Lorie L. Tekorius,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,Wash your hands.
98,"The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,98,Operator,,,"Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a great day."
