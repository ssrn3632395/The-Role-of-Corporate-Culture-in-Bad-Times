0,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
1,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,1,Blayne Peter Curtis,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Obviously, the backdrop here, I think most companies are lowering numbers, you had some good results. I'm curious, kind of a couple of things on that front. One, if you can just talk about where you saw shortages, if there's any quantification on kind of how much that impact was. And then I'm kind of just curious as you're looking forward here, you kind of have 2 opposing factors. Seems like you probably would benefit from some work from home, which could be a near-term boost. But then obviously, you have a big consumer business in Brazil. And I am no expert on COVID exposures in Brazil, but I think most people assume that's going to get worse. So I was just kind of curious how you're handicapping that?"
2,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,2,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"As you know, Blayne, Jack and I are in different places. So we will try to give you a coordinated response. I will start, and Jack can fill in. To come back to your question about -- let me start at the end with respect to Brazil. So Brazil has, by the way, many of the same restrictions in place today as we do in most of the United States. So in other words, we have stay-at-home restrictions as well as retail and travel are significantly limited. And so effectively, what you have is most of our staff are working from home, except for manufacturing, which is not possible to do from home. We are seeing some of our customers have slowdowns and shutdowns for temporary, maybe because they had a case of positive of COVID. And so it is an uneven environment and less predictable. But as you pointed out, some of the benefits we are seeing are from the -- particularly the PC and the server market, PC laptop server, not as much in the mobile phone market."
3,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,3,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"The mobile phone market, at least for now, we can see production levels are down, and that was, to some degree, driven by component shortages. But now I think we are going to see a different effect, which is factories are also slowing down because of shutdowns and some temporary situations at certain customers, not all customers. So it is a fluid situation. But we've been obviously looking at our backlog and what we've shipped already. And as a result, we're pretty comfortable with where we are in terms of our Q3 estimates. And obviously, we have backlog by this stage for much of what we're talking about. Barring some significant incidents, which causes us to shut down operations or something like that, we're pretty confident in our estimates."
4,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,4,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Now to come back to the beginning of your question, which is shortages from China, which was a little earlier in the quarter, we had shortages and they rippled through all the way to the supply chain. Mostly, what we buy in China is our circuit boards and passives. But Jack, you might care to elaborate further on that."
5,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,5,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. Real quick, Blayne, to also -- some of our customers had a component shortage, if you're going that way with the question. Seems like even in Brazil, when Ajay mentioned that we didn't ship some mobile memory because of component shortages, it was our customers who couldn't get parts, not us. So the phone guys couldn't get enough parts to build phones so they shut down for a little bit during the quarter. As far as us, we didn't really have an issue of getting our parts, but we had customers who couldn't get some of their parts out of China. And then we had the Chinese contract manufacturers shut down for 5 weeks or so in the quarter. So yes, there was a minimal impact to us in the quarter, but it wasn't anything dramatic in our Q2."
6,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,6,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"And just one last one, if you could just -- the gross margin improvement into May, what's driving that?"
7,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,7,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. I mean a lot of it is that Specialty Compute, which is the highest gross margin segment of the business, is going to -- projected to have a better quarter in Q3. Remember, in Q2, we talked about the governments that have got pushed. So that got pushed into Q3. And so the performance there will improve the margin somewhat in the quarter."
8,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,8,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.
9,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,9,Rajvindra S. Gill,"Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A question on the memory market. My understanding is that the lead times have kind of stretched out for memory and both for DRAM and NAND, and we're starting to see increased pricing in Flash and DRAM. Wondering if you could kind of comment on your thoughts on that dynamic that you're seeing in the market and how that's kind of bleeding into your business?"
10,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,10,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. I could start and maybe Ajay can come in and finish a little bit. Yes, we're seeing -- we are definitely seeing DRAM lead time stretch out. We've seen those get out to 12, 15 weeks. We're seeing Flash, still longer, especially in caps and resistors. So we're kind of back to a situation now where customers are placing orders earlier to get their parts, which is helpful to us. And Ajay mentioned earlier we have a backlog for most of our business during the quarter. And so we're getting more backlog again from customers as they have to order farther out to make sure that they get their parts. So far, it's not hurting us from a revenue or margin standpoint. It gives a little bit better visibility."
11,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,11,Rajvindra S. Gill,"Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Got it. And you talked about some of the end markets, oil and gas being weaker, offset by network storage, telecom. You kind of lumped PC and mobile together at like 34%. It seems to me that there could be some issues in mobile given the production problems. Wondering if you could kind of break out the and storage. I'm just trying to see what the -- to pinpoint the exposure."
12,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,12,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So most of the mobile and PC, all -- pretty much all of that's in Brazil. The only place we really play in the consumer markets are in Brazil. So that's really all Brazil exposure. So it's not a worldwide kind of phenomenon there. And so there, you're probably still looking at -- 2/3 of that is probably mobile, 1/3 of that would be PCs."
13,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,13,Rajvindra S. Gill,"Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. And in terms of just the weakening the real. So you talked about putting FX contracts to try to minimize your AP payments. But you have not seen the impact yet on actual end demand. So I'm just wondering what would -- when would you see that? And would it be just obviously in just lower sell- through for these phones?
14,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,14,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean we should see it in our -- we should see it from our customers, right? We would start getting lower forecast from the cell phone guys in Brazil, say, the Lenovo and LG that their 6 months forecast for us will start to decrease if their sell-through was going down. And so far, we haven't seen that yet in Brazil."
15,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,15,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"As you might imagine, Raji, this is a point that we're particularly focused on because we can see the effects of a 20% change in the exchange rate on the end price of the product. And to top it all off, you have significant slowdowns in retail, right? And there are quite a few phones sold through retail. So meanwhile, online is, even in Brazil, growing much faster. And so if we sound like we're not able to give you an extremely clear answer, it's because we are not in that we -- the forecasts we're getting, as recently as this week, are continuing to show pretty -- not showing any significant drop-off. I mean there's changes, but not significant. What we are seeing are the effects of factories shutting down for a week, 2 weeks because of issues with infections."
16,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,16,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
17,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,17,Shek Ming Ho,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A couple of them, I -- for the Specialty Computing business, I wonder if you can double-click on that and give us some color what portion of that business you consider as stable and what is more like GDP-driven that may get impacted in the macro environment we're in, particularly interested in your view on some of the government projects. And kind of related to that, Ajay, you talked about increasing -- you're seeing an increasing potential from the 3 acquisitions. Maybe can you get into a little more color what those potential could be."
18,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,18,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, Sidney, thank you. I'll start, and maybe Jack can add to it. The -- starting with the sectors, we have a fair amount of business, as you noted, with government and government labs and different government agencies. And we don't see any drop-off in activity there. If anything, the spending has increased, as you've noted in the press, I'm sure. We do have a fair amount of business with financial services, with -- mostly from an analytics point of view with medical, particularly analytics and trials and that business seems all right. We have a fair amount of business with social media, and that business seems pretty well all right. We have some business in that entire segment related to telecom. And so far, that's good. We have some business related to industrial, and frankly, it's a small segment, but we could see a little bit of push out in the industrial segment. And as you -- as I think I noted in my comments, we have some business related to oil and gas. And that oil and gas business, frankly, it's kind of -- I'm speculating when I say we expect it to get weaker because we have not seen it get weaker yet. But maybe that's because they're all working from home and haven't yet got to the point where they've decided to relook at their CapEx. So I'm speculating. I don't really know. I'm guessing that one would expect the oil and gas-related large installations to be weaker going forward. Much as our business today, it doesn't seem to be showing that."
19,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,19,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"And finally, we have, in our wireless computing area, some consumer-related exposure, which is actually doing extremely strongly. And then we have some enterprise related, which we are not quite sure how it's going to pan out. But when we combine all that and take into account the seasonality of that business, at least in our third quarter and from what we can see going forward, we have a pretty strong position and not a lot of weak ones."
20,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,20,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,Great. And in terms of -- you talked about this increasing potential that you're seeing from the acquisitions. Can you give us a little more color on those?
21,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,21,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Well, those are what we're talking about in Specialty Compute. All of our acquisitions have been in that line of business, the Specialty Computing and Storage line of business. So that is what I was talking about. And one area which we acquired, Penguin Computing, high-performance computing, that's doing pretty well. Another area is Embedded Computing and there, we have a fair amount of government- related business and defense-related business, and that's doing pretty well. And then we have wireless computing, which are doing really well because that's growing very significantly with both existing customers that are growing and new customers. So hopefully, that's in line with your question."
22,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,22,Shek Ming Ho,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Great. Maybe a follow-up question. I appreciate the gross margin color you guys provided in the quarterly filings. As we look forward, how do you think about the gross margin for the Specialty Computing business? I think it has improved, like at least 10 points from a year ago. Is that something you can think about a 3-handle? And then which of the 3 businesses do you expect to see the most upside potential from where they are today?"
23,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,23,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, I can jump into that one. I mean the reason you've seen the big increase of Artesyn, right, when we bought Artesyn, we said that was like a 40% gross margin-type business. So the purchase of Artesyn has really bumped up the gross margins as to why you see that Specialty higher now. I think going forward, as we've been talking about, we think we can continue to improve the Penguin margins. So I think go forward, the biggest improvement in this area will be the Penguin margins, especially as we get more and more managed services in that business. I mean, Ajay talked about this quarter was our best quarter for bookings, and a lot of that was in kind of some of the managed service areas, we continue to improve that business. And if our managed services business grows, we'll continue to see the gross margins in those business grow."
24,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,24,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Great. If I can squeeze in one more question. Go ahead. Go ahead, Jack."
25,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,25,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. No, no. And you might see a 3-handle sometime for that business in the future certainly."
26,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,26,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Great. One last question for me. Are you -- in the guidance, are you expecting any onetime charges, whether that's in cost of goods sold or operating expenses related to logistics-related costs? Ajay, you mentioned component availability from China, operational challenges in China. Anything specific that is a onetime thing that may come off in the following quarter?"
27,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,27,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,No.
28,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,28,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Well, maybe, again, not knowing exactly what you're referring to. So the convertible debt, we had a significant number of onetime expenses related to that offering and to -- related to the extinguishing of our term debt. So you see that already in our financial statements, if that's what you mean. The other question..."
29,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,29,Shek Ming Ho,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, I was thinking more on the operational side."
30,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,30,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. On the operational, and it's a question as to whether you would call it operational. I mean, the depreciation of the real, the Brazilian real may -- it's been a very rapid depreciation. Exactly how that's going to play through, we're still trying to figure out. Obviously, it reduces our local costs, labor and facilities and so on. But meanwhile, it means that prices in local currency are higher. How that's all going to play through? We don't know. But no, we're not anticipating any very specific onetime costs related to operations, if that's your question."
31,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,31,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel.
32,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,32,Brian Edward Chin,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And maybe the first question, just to level set, go back to just your outlook for the May quarter, 5% sequential growth at the midpoint. Can you maybe walk us through your thinking in terms of how Brazil is going to do there relative to the guide, Specialty Memory as well as Specialty Compute?"
33,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,33,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. I can kind of take it to a high level. At a high level, we would expect our Brazil business to be maybe fairly flat kind of quarter-over-quarter. We would expect both Specialty Compute and Specialty Memory to grow in Q3. And Specialty Compute will probably a little bit faster than Specialty Memory in the Q3 quarter."
34,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,34,Brian Edward Chin,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a couple of follow-ups. First, in terms of Specialty Memory, obviously, strong solid growth there in the February quarter, growth again for the May quarter. Yes. I know that a lot of your production, I believe, is sort of Malaysia, Southeast Asia and probably your neck of the woods, in Newark. But when those shelter-in-place measures started to become more acute sort of mid- March, if you will, early in the quarter, I'm curious, it sounds like you haven't really seen an impact on your business from a production side. I'm curious if your customers what was sort of their reaction when that happened? Was it kind of maybe to buffer up more product? Do you see a change in terms of their behavior?"
35,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,35,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"I mean, I think in the Specialty Memory section, the customers were just, one, wanted to make sure that we were going to operate to support them, right, because a lot of our customers that we have in Specialty Memory are in the critical infrastructure, some in the medical and in the defense area. And so they're all critical, potential business as well they need to operate. So it's more coming to us to making sure we were going to operate, which we were, and then just wanted to make sure that we could meet their schedules that they have. And most of the products right now, as we had talked earlier, the lead times have lengthened out considerably. And so they want to make sure that we're still going to be able to ship what we've committed to for the quarter. It's mainly not -- mainly is making sure that we can ship what we are going to -- we've already committed to in the quarter during this time."
36,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,36,Brian Edward Chin,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it. Okay. Then maybe...
37,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,37,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,Was that an helpful?
38,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,38,Brian Edward Chin,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, that's helpful, Jack. Yes, walking over to Brazil then. Again, it sounds like -- maybe you can help out. One, is there -- based on customers, like you said, the kind of funnel impact here of shutting down production relative to sort of the virus outbreak. Are you seeing any impact in your fiscal 3Q in terms of that? You said Brazil having kind of flattish revenue, but are you seeing any impact there in that Flash? And then secondly, on the demand side of that, to what extent have you seen the weaker real sort of customers actually adjust their product pricing, your customers in terms of them selling to the consumers out there? Has that adjustment been made? And is that maybe part of the lag here? And kind of from a timing perspective, if you did see sort of the rolling forecast revisions maybe trend down, do you have a sense on timing? Is that sort of like a mid-year or calendar year event? Or any sort of color you could provide there would be helpful."
39,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,39,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. I'll take part of that, maybe Ajay can answer a part, too. I mean as far as the customer forecast, so we have customer forecast pretty much every week -- every 2 weeks from the customers. And they're kind of constantly looking out at the future and adjusting them. So we don't wait like 6 months to get a whole new forecast of pops and things change. And so they've been slowly adjusting their forecast. But as Ajay mentioned earlier, we haven't seen any major change from our customers in Brazil yet on their forecast due to demand. Their demand seems pretty good. We've had some ups and downs, as Ajay mentioned because somebody might have shut a factory down for a week or 2, another back up and running, so there's been little blips like that but nothing from a long-term forecast."
40,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,40,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"And as I mentioned, we really haven't seen the impact of the real weaken their demand yet. And I think they've been putting through price increases on their products. They're not eating the weakness in the real. And based on our forecast, consumers must still be buying them at this -- at the higher price. The interesting fact in Brazil is that a lot of people finance products, even phones in Brazil. Even though the real has weakened a little bit, the bank for lending rate, the government lending rate is really low right now. So you have lower interest rates you've had in a long time. So that might be impacting -- it might be going the other way from a weaker real, they could finance it cheaper. So maybe their overall spend hasn't been changed that much. I don't know."
41,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,41,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean, to be honest with you, I -- we totally get your question. And we've been asking exactly the same question of our team in Brazil and trying to check in with customers as well because we can see what's happening. And if prices go up by 20%, and -- wouldn't we expect that to affect demand? And so we can't assure you that it's not going to. We really -- I wish I could. But what we can tell you is that we've been checking on that. And so far, our customers are not telling us. In fact, we're asking kind of aggressively, ""Are you sure your forecast is real?"" because what we don't want is a repeat of an inventory buildup followed by cliff. And they assure us that they have recalculated their forecast based on the demand that they're seeing now. And based on that, these are their forecasts. So we're blessed with only so much visibility into this, and that's what we have so far."
42,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,42,Brian Edward Chin,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Maybe just to wedge one more thing in relative to -- so the units could -- the forecasts still are maintained. We'll kind of see what headwinds evolve there. But in terms of the content, I think you did allude in the prepared remarks, you're seeing some content improvement maybe in terms of like MCPs or whatnot. Maybe if you can kind of comment on maybe what you might be seeing in terms of content pickup."
43,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,43,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We've mentioned before that in Brazil, there is a system that went into place in July last year that has local content measured in points and we mentioned at the time that if you think about it from our customers' point of view, they have a significant benefit in certain commodities from the point because they can now pick and choose which commodities they want to emphasize in their purchases of local -- locally produced product. And it turns out memory provides some of the best advantages. So what you're seeing really is a flow-through of exactly that, which is that for our customers, memory provides some of the best way by which they can meet their local content requirements. And as I was also saying, as of the end of December, literally the very end of December, there's a new law in place, which went into effect April 1. So it's a law that is effective roughly a week back. And this law very clearly spells out how tax benefits will work going forward for all these companies, including for ourselves. And so as a result, customers are comfortable that they know how to operate in this environment."
44,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,44,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"For a year now -- for maybe 6 to 9 months, I should say, there was a fair amount of uncertainty, but now I think that that's cleared up. And that's helping customers to be very clear about their strategies, and therefore, they give us a longer-term view of their business. And also, it's helping them in that both the average densities are going up. I mean that's just happening across the world. Products are consuming more memory, I mean, I'm talking about smartphones. And they're giving us a greater share of the higher density product mix. So that's what we're seeing. And I think it has a lot to do with the fact that there's less, I don't know, confusion or uncertainty about what the regulations are."
45,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,45,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Suji Desilva with Roth Capital.
46,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,46,Suji Desilva,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A lot of conversation about Brazil, but I wasn't sure if you covered it. Can you talk about why Brazil in the quarter you reported was outperformed seasonality? Were there pull-ins potentially?"
47,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,47,Suji Desilva,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"No. Mostly, it was higher-density products in the mobile area. And in DRAM, PCs have been fairly strong. But clearly, higher-density product units were a little lower compared to the previous quarter as expected because you have a 2-week shutdown at Christmas and then a slowdown related to Carnival that comes in a little later. But in spite of that, we had a good quarter above our plan, particularly because of mobile product entities."
48,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,48,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean, ASPs were up about 60% in the mobile area from Q1 to Q2. So they're turning back up as the densities of the products are growing again."
49,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,49,Suji Desilva,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it. Okay. Then my other question is on the SSD part of the business. Is there a percent of revenue or material part of the revenue you would call out that SSD is expected to provide in the next 4 to 8 quarters to get a sense of how big you think that business could be?
50,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,50,Suji Desilva,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"When you say SSD, are you talking about Specialty Flash? Are you talking in Brazil, I guess?"

52,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,52,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"I mean, we've talked about that the growth engine of Specialty Memory as a whole, so I mean, that continues to grow. But we don't have a firm number to -- this is going to be half the business, 3/4 of the business. We keep getting wins. And -- but we've added a lot of big wins in the Specialty -- in the DRAM business. This was a great quarter for DRAM as well. So even though the Specialty Flash SSD business is growing with a new controller, we're getting new design wins, we had a very good quarter in NVDIMM design wins, as Ajay mentioned, and just memory design wins. So the whole business as a whole had a very good quarter and is ramping up and continues to grow, as you see in our numbers."
53,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,53,Operator,,,And our last question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
54,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,54,Mark John Lipacis,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I was on, but my line dropped, and so I apologize if the question was asked. The -- so I guess some investors that I speak with are concerned that as the virus moves around the world, that is going to impact different supply chains. And I think most people believe that China has been coming back, but some other places are starting to get hit and have been shutting down. I was wondering if there is like a -- if you could just review briefly like how your supply chain, what geographies you're most exposed to."
55,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,55,Mark John Lipacis,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Sure. Do you want me to start that off, Jack?"
56,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,56,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, if you want to."
57,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,57,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Mark, the -- we have essentially 3 major manufacturing locations, and then we have a number of other smaller ones. The major ones are in Malaysia. Our main Asian center is in Malaysia. And then, of course, we have the Brazilian one, which we've talked about quite often. And finally, we have in the Bay Area 2 manufacturing facilities: one primarily focused on the high-performance computing, the large systems; and the other one, a mixture of components and boards and systems. And Malaysia was relatively unscathed in the early part of this crisis since, say, January when China was going through a particularly difficult levels of shutdowns, January and then parts of February. That has clearly improved, meaning China has improved."
58,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,58,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Now Malaysia, meanwhile, had a number of cases, and the government got quite restrictive in terms of any gatherings of people, including for work or manufacturing. However, this has now been a very specific discussion with the Malaysian government by what is called the American Chamber of mostly technology companies. And there, as a result, an agreement that is in detail, and it details what we can do in terms of number of staff and so on and details what we can't do. And we get checked on that. So we think that, in a way, it's a good thing because we're clearly regulated, if you will. And we're operating under those regulations at less than full strength. That's already true today. Now this is a changing world, and I can't assure you that, that will be the case 2 weeks from now. But I think that the government has showed that if we take reasonable measures and make sure -- and we are really, really focused on the safety of our staff, first and foremost. We will not take a risk that puts them at in harm's way. So in Malaysia, I think we're okay."
59,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,59,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In Brazil, we operate a factory, which is really a clean room, lots of very heavy air flow, and we've put in place a whole lot of procedures to make sure that social distancing works. And so far, we haven't had any issues. And finally, in -- we operate in Alameda County, and we've had discussions with the Alameda County health authorities and showed them exactly what we're doing. And they've been satisfied with it and have continued to let us operate as an essential business. Maybe a long answer to your question. I'm not sure if that's what you wanted."
60,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,60,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"No, it's actually what I was hoping to get. Yes, sorry, Jack, go ahead."
61,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,61,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,No problem. That's good.
62,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,62,Mark John Lipacis,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So I had a follow-up, if I may. We've been doing a lot of checks in the supply chain. And I think the thing I've been most surprised about, if not shocked about, is how little that we're hearing about material order cuts. In fact, sometimes the opposite. And it's in the quarter you just reported and the outlook is a personification of that. And it seems that you might share that kind of perspective of surprise. And I guess my question is, to what extent do you think this is coming from that we just finished an inventory the fact that you guys are in the ""good"" end markets or versus is this something that's just going to come? I know that's an impossible answer to have -- or a question to have an answer to, but I was hoping you might share your view on that."
63,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,63,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Is it possible, Mark, for me to ask you that question?"
64,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,64,Mark John Lipacis,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,I'm in. I can send you my report on this.
65,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,65,Jack A. Pacheco,"Executive VP, COO & CFO",EXECUTIVES,"We've been listening to your webcast too, Mark, trying to get information from you."
66,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,66,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It's a very uncertain time. But we think there is elements of all of what you said. Meaning, first and foremost, the sectors we serve are the sectors that are actually doing almost, to a degree, being pushed forward by this crisis like, for example, the communications area, both telecommunications and enterprise communications. The other areas that we serve also seem pretty strong. So that maybe is one issue. The other might be an inventory issue, and it could be in 2 forms. It could be what you sort of suggested, which is a previous inventory lean-out that's now being filled back up or it could be a little bit of overbuying to make sure that they are not short. And we try very hard to keep an eye on that, but I can't tell you we have perfect visibility into that. So at least those 2 things are strong in our favor."
67,"SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,67,Ajay B. Shah,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Shah for closing remarks.
