0,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.
1,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,1,Operator,,,Next participant is from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America.
2,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,2,Heather Nicole Balsky,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Glad to hear everything is going well, and everyone is in good health. Can you just talk about how your various wholesale partners in Europe and in the U.S. are responding to this in terms of working capital and in terms of inventory orders? And then can you talk about the levers and tools you have to manage working capital during this downturn?"
3,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,3,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Heather, glad to see you safe and healthy. Thanks for asking the question. We are blessed that we have customers and wholesale partners that we have great relationships with. We are working with each one of them on a case-by-case basis. We're collecting the cash that's owed to us. We are managing inventory. The good news is that, as I mentioned, given that our inventory levels were generally healthy as we entered the quarter and ended the 2019, we're in a good spot. A large piece of our inventory, including the in-trade inventory, is core. So we believe that once the retailers open their stores and we open our stores, we'll be able to work through that. And we are in discussion with our partners. We are asking them to pay us what they owe us, which is the standing of a good relationship, and we're working through with them to be ready when the crisis is over and behind us."
4,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,4,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"One other quick thing I would add, Heather, is we do have customers that are still in business and still opening their doors and still shipping products. So Walmart, Target, Amazon here in the U.S. are all trading, and we're still shipping product to them, and same is true with some of the pure-play e-commerce players in Europe. So we do have some revenue right now and some consumer transactions happening in wholesale. But as you know, the majority of the large department store chains here in the U.S. are closed. And that's largely true in Europe, across Europe as well."
5,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,5,Operator,,,We have our next question from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.
6,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,6,Matthew Robert Boss,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. And congrats on a nice quarter. So Chip, as we think about the brand's top and bottom line acceleration into the crisis, I thought your prepared remarks were actually really interesting. I guess how do you weigh market share versus profitability to emerge from this as a stronger brand, as you said, without taking some level of a step back?"
7,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,7,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So I sort of talked about it in the prepared remarks, we are very focused right now on how do we come out of this stronger as a company, but also how does the Levi's brand come out of this crisis even stronger? So let me hit a couple of things on why I think that's possible. First of all, coming into the crisis, there's a very good proof point about the strength of the brand, and that is called pricing power. We have been talking about pricing power. We took pricing at the end of last year, and you saw it flow through in the gross margin and gross profit line this year, I mean -- or this past quarter, Q1. So nothing better demonstrates the strength of a brand than the ability to price. And we did that successfully in Q1."
8,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,8,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Second, we're continuing to invest during this period. We have not gone completely dark. We are cutting back -- to be very clear, we are cutting back on A&P, but we're being deliberate and strategic about actions that we can take to strengthen the relationship between the brand and the consumer. And the 5:01 concert series is, I think, a great proof point of that. And every day, it just keeps getting more momentum. We're trying to find ways to connect more strongly with consumers during the period of time that they're cooped up."
9,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,9,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Third is on the product front. We are going to continue to bring newness. This Super Mario from Nintendo collaboration, that's dropped in China and Asia and Europe and drops later this week here, brings some fun and some newness to the brand. So we're not stopping. We're not pausing. We're continuing to go forward on product and product innovation. And finally, we're going to continue to leverage digital, everything digital. So we launched the app a few months ago, and that's off to a really good start. We've got our loyalty program, we're going to continue to double down on that, and our e-commerce business."
10,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,10,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And then I guess the last thing I would say is I do believe crisis creates opportunities. There are going to be some players in this industry that don't make it, and that's going to open up real estate opportunities for us potentially. It could -- we could wind up being the share beneficiary of others not making it. And as I kind of cruise the Internet and Instagram and look at our Facebook page and stuff, a lot of people are writing about, well, I'm working at home, I'm kicking back in my Levi's, and it's become a Levi's moment. And I think that gives us something to build on as we come out of this crisis."
11,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,11,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So we're really focused on it, and I'm very, very confident that whatever the shock is to the consumer and the economy, when the consumer does emerge from hibernation, they're going to want to go back to the brands that they love and to the brands that they're comfortable with, and they've got a relationship with. And that's why I believe we're poised to win in this environment."
12,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,12,Matthew Robert Boss,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. Maybe to switch gears to Europe. So it's close to 1/3 of your sales. It's been a meaningful driver of growth. So maybe precrisis, can you speak to profitability metrics and drivers of the pricing power that you were seeing in Europe? And then as we think postcrisis, just the remaining opportunity as we think about the profitability and pricing opportunity that you continue to see in Europe."
13,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,13,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. Matt, precrisis, as you know, we've been growing Europe now in the mid-teens and for a couple of seen clear leverage, which means that we've been growing the top line as well as driving leverage to the bottom line. We did take pricing in the second half of last year. That pricing stuck and has continued to stick just -- until just before the crisis. The brand is very, very strong. Our entire portfolio of products are resonating really well in Europe. So think men's bottoms, which were up 10% in the quarter. Our women's business grew 19% on top of real strong growth the previous year. And so we've also continued to see growth in tops. Execution continues to be very strong across both franchise and our company operations. So our view is that, as stores begin to reopen, the strength of the brand, besides all the pricing that we took and the wonderful execution that the team on the ground brings to the market, I think will stand us well especially as some of our other peers or competitors, who are in a tougher position, think through things differently. So we've gained market share. We think we'll emerge out of the crisis a lot stronger."
14,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,14,Operator,,,Next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.
15,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,15,Paul Lawrence Lejuez,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I'm curious, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you say that you've seen an acceleration in your e-com sales since stores have been closed? And curious what you're seeing in terms of changes to the basket size and mix of business. And just curious if online sales may be skewed towards bottoms versus tops more so these days than normal."
16,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,16,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Paul. So the acceleration or the growth in the digital business, we have seen in China. So China at the end of the first month as stores have opened, the business is positive year-over-year. Across our other e-commerce business, the business is broadly flat, I would say. Asia is up. Asia is positive. Europe and the U.S. is slightly down. So overall, the business has been flat. In terms of your question of bottoms and tops, the ratio, both in China as well as in the U.S., is broadly the same it was before the crisis. So we haven't seen any dramatic change in the mix of the business."
17,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,17,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,No Zoom effect?
18,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,18,Paul Lawrence Lejuez,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Thanks, Harmit. And just to be clear…"
19,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,19,Paul Lawrence Lejuez,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I mean I think the other -- it's important to note that over the years, we've continued to add stretch in our bottoms. And I think at last count, over 80% of our bottoms had reasonable amount of stretch. So to Chip's point, people working at home probably are feeling a lot more comfortable."
20,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,20,Paul Lawrence Lejuez,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. And can you also talk about in your DTC business, first quarter, ex Black Friday, strong performance? I'm just curious if you could break down e-com versus full price versus factory stores."
21,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,21,Paul Lawrence Lejuez,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I think if you look at our first -- quarter one, our brick-and-mortar was up 14; e-commerce was up 12. I don't have the e-commerce numbers on top of my head ex Black Friday. But I don't have it off the top of my head, but I would say both were reasonably strong from that perspective."
22,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,22,Paul Lawrence Lejuez,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Your next question is from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.
23,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,23,Kimberly Conroy Greenberger,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Fantastic. I wanted to start with just understanding what percentage of your total inventory would have some sort of a seasonal element as opposed to evergreen sort of product? If you could help us understand that because perhaps there's less markdown risk on the evergreen product. And then secondarily, what are you hearing from your vendors in terms of third quarter orders or fourth quarter orders? What's the early look at your -- at your order book? And then lastly, what sort of markdown support or margin support are your wholesale partners currently looking for?"
24,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,24,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Kimberly, as I said, the good news is we have worked away at inventory and improving inventory turns over the last couple of years. So the inventory leverage, which is the growth or the decline in inventory relative to the growth in revenue, has been positive. So we entered the quarter with inventory down 7%. 70% of that is core. I would say seasonal inventory is about 15% to 20%. And we are working through with both our wholesale partners as well as franchisees in ways and means we can, as the stores open, sell that product. I think, going back to what Chip said, the strength of the brand as well as the newness that our products bring to bear, we are generally confident that we can balance growing revenue and gross margin. The other thing on gross margin, just to your point, we're starting at a very good spot. Our gross margins are at a record high. And I think that will bode us well, both through the crisis as well as we emerge out of it."
25,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,25,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"To your question about the discussions on order book, et cetera, again, it's case by case. We have adjusted our inventory based on the demand signal we have got. We have a fairly flexible supply chain, and so if things come back faster, we can flex it up. We also have the F.L.X. platform where we can chase fashion trends because we have length, which is, again, something that is going to be a competitive differentiation for us relative to the rest of the folks in the apparel industry."
26,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,26,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I guess the only other thing to add is -- just real briefly, is -- and I think we said it in the prepared remarks, but we have cut all unfilled purchase orders in the second half of the year. So we are trying to aggressively manage the second half inventory in terms of inbound, just recognizing that everybody -- all of our customers are going to have to work off this inventory from their stores being closed. But the good news is more than 70% of our inventory is core replenishment and that can carry over to the next season."
27,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,27,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Great. Okay. Then last for me. I understand that when China reopened, the stores were still comping down. If you think about the last week or 2, what's sort of the magnitude of the recent performance in comparable store sales for China?"
28,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,28,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I hate talking about averages on a store base of 500 stores. We have mixed performance there. We have some stores that are already comping ahead of prior year, and we have some that are still significantly down versus prior year. But I think what's important is, since the stores started reopening, traffic has kind of improved sequentially, kind of week over week. And our business performance in the aggregate has improved week over week, and we're seeing our e-commerce business now comping consumer is coming back, albeit maybe a little bit tentatively, but there's -- there are green shoots of optimism."
29,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,29,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"It's also worth noting that our mainline doors, particularly the ones that have our more premium assortments in them, seem to be doing best right now versus prior year. And that may be part of the playbook as we go forward."
30,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,30,Operator,,,"And gross margin, Kimberly, you heard me say, gross margins were up."
31,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,31,Operator,,,We have our next question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.
32,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,32,Robert Scott Drbul,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I was just wondering if you guys -- I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more just like U.S. wholesale, but specifically the mass channel in terms of what you've seen there, what you're seeing there. A lot of discussion around tops in mass versus bottoms in mass. I was just wondering if maybe you could just talk to those trends, even post quarter end."
33,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,33,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Well, I did kind of allude to it that both Walmart and Target are still open, and we continue to be very optimistic about the test which we've now continued to expand, we're kind of north of 100 doors with Target, feeling really, really good about that. As Harmit mentioned earlier, we haven't really seen a dramatic shift from bottoms to tops. I know a lot of people are talking about that, and they're calling it the Zoom effect. People are wearing their pajamas down below and a nice top up above. But we haven't really seen a dramatic shift to our mix from tops to bottoms on our businesses. So we're encouraged with the business performance of Levi's Red Tab at Target. We also have our value brands, Signature and Denizen, in Walmart and Target. And they actually were flattish, down about 1 point or 2 points versus the prior year in Q1. And that may have been -- we're still trying to figure out how much of that was consumer and consumption-driven versus those customers shifting their open-to-buy budgets to other household necessities: toilet paper, paper towels, hand sanitizer and food. I suspect it's probably more of the latter than it is the former. So we'll see as this crisis unfolds."
34,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,34,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But I do think it's important to say that we do have a portfolio of brands, and these value brands play a role in our portfolio. And as the consumer gets shocked and potentially as we see big spikes of unemployment, we've got a brand there for the consumer, and it's great product at that value price point."
35,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,35,Robert Scott Drbul,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. And in terms of the supply chain generally, have you been able to procure everything sort of timely? And has that been operating for you pretty smoothly?"
36,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,36,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We're good right now. Well, I was just -- I mean, very shortly, in short, yes, we're good. And we're good with what we have on hand right now. And particularly with just about everybody being closed, we're more than good. And we're pretty confident about what we have coming in for the second half. So a good part of the second half is already produced and waiting to go onto boats to ship over here for later in the summer when it should be hitting consumer -- or customers' floors."
37,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,37,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Harmit, I don't know -- I'm sorry if I cut you off."
38,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,38,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. No worries, Chip. This is a wonderful virtual dialogue. But I'd say 3 other things, Bob. First, as a value-based company that's been around 167 years, we're taking full responsibility for finished, ready- to-ship orders. And we're working on timetables, adjusted timetables, with our vendors. We have a program in place for our vendors to get early payments at favorable market rates, and several vendors take advantage of this already. We're looking at ways to expand this program to the benefit of vendors. And last but not the least, Chip talked about a $3 million grant. Of that, we're granting $1 million to organizations that support apparel supply chain workers with a focus on public health responses, particularly for women, and we're working with industry stakeholders to explore options for broader collective response so that we can support workers during this crisis. So we're doing a lot more than just making sure the goods we need are delivered."
39,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,39,Robert Scott Drbul,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. And if I could just sneak in one more question. I know that the Nintendo Super Mario Bros. launch has gone well internationally. Is it true that Chris Ogle got an early pair for the ones here in the U.S., and that's what he's wearing during this conference call?"
40,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,40,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,He is absolutely wearing it. How did you know? That's crazy.
41,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,41,Robert Scott Drbul,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,A little birdie told me that.
42,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,42,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"It is true. It's a really fun product. It hits later this week. So hopefully, everybody will go out and get some. Thanks, Bob."
43,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,43,Operator,,,Your next question is from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.
44,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,44,Operator,,,Next question is from the line of Jay Sole from UBS.
45,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,45,Jay Daniel Sole,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. Chip, you mentioned there could be some real estate opportunities that arise from this situation. Just related to that, can you talk about any progress you've made over the last quarter developing the full price store model for the U.S.?"
46,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,46,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It's -- we remain really optimistic about this new store model, which is smaller footprint, better location. We've got a couple of them. We have a few more coming. We're not stopping those. Those are still planned to open later this summer. The one I always talk about as an example is the Stanford Mall. We need to, I guess, get a little bit more clarity on how long and how deep and how much of a problem do we really have here from a financial standpoint before we can commit to whether we would accelerate that model or not. I mean, as Harmit said, balance sheet and cash is king right now, and we don't want to get out over our skis from a capital standpoint. But we're bullish about this, and I'm very optimistic about it, impact, and it will create opportunities, and it could create opportunities for us to find more of those kind of locations more quickly."
47,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,47,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And if we've got the financial strength and flexibility, we may pounce on it and not miss the opportunity to capitalize on the environment and the situation that's going to happen. So we remain optimistic about it. These stores, the ones that we've opened that are kind of along the lines of this model, are profitable. I think Harmit said it in the script, but our ROIC on our store base right now on a global basis is like 20%. So we clearly have an opportunity for more mainline doors here in the U.S. We only have a little bit more than 30 right now. So we'll take advantage of the opportunity if the right opportunities come along."
48,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,48,Jay Daniel Sole,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. And then maybe if I could just ask one more on inventory. You talked about the uncertainty of the situation, and it's got to be difficult to plan for holiday not knowing how consumers are going to behave and if they're going to be coming back to stores or if they're going to increase shopping online. Can you just touch on a little bit more the kind of flexibility that you have to be able to shift inventory between stores and online? Just to react to whatever happens as we go through the rest of the year?"
49,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,49,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Well, I'd say, first and most importantly, we've developed the ability to ship from store. We can fulfill e-commerce orders from store, and in fact, we're going to start firing that back up here in the next week or so, just so we can mitigate the potential risk of our e-commerce distribution center or the largest distribution center potentially getting shut down. I mean, in a number of states, distribution centers that aren't shipping food or medicine are getting shut down as not being necessary or business-essential. And so we want to mitigate that possible risk, and we've built that muscle, that capability. So that's the first thing I would say."
50,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,50,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The second thing is we've got -- I talked about our e-commerce site, it's basically our best store, and it has a large variety of PC9s and assortments that we have in both our mainline and outlet doors. And we have plenty of flexibility to shift inventory from stores to e-commerce and in both directions. So we've got maximum flexibility to do it."
51,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,51,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Hey, thanks, Jay."
52,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,52,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Is Omar back?
53,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,53,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Omar."
54,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,54,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, we can."
55,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,55,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. He just texted me. I think he's back. So operator, can you try and see if you can get Omar back? Otherwise, we'll do one more question."
56,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,56,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.
57,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,57,Omar Regis Saad,"Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Are you guys there? Can you hear me?
58,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,58,Omar Regis Saad,"Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Apologies if this has been asked, but I wanted to kind of dive into the consumer behavior side of this equation. I know it's easy and enticing to talk about the pre-coronavirus world and the post-coronavirus world. But it's not yet clear, I think, how long we're going to be in this coronavirus world and what it means on consumer behavior. So anything you're learning in how consumers are acting in China or different parts of China? Any thoughts on how consumer behavior might be the same or different in your categories in Europe or North America? And then, I guess, is the key here when you can reopen stores? Or is the key here when consumers feel comfortable and safe to go back to things like concerts and music festivals and other kind of public bars and happy hours, jeans and casual attire occasions? Or -- so maybe you can kind of walk me through some of those things as well."
59,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,59,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Well, so I'm the big consumer guy here, and we're trying to learn as much as we can in China. And I would say that China may not be a perfect model for everything that we might expect to see in the West, and that's for a whole host of reasons. But it's quite possible here in the West we're going to see a much bigger economic impact, more job loss, and we're already seeing it, right? 10 million people filing for unemployment in the last 2 weeks. And I think all of those dynamics could potentially have an effect on the consumer."
60,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,60,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But what I can tell you about China is that, as we brought our stores back up, freshness and newness matter. Our top-selling item for women is the new balloon fit, which we literally just launched. And so they're looking for fashion, they're looking for newness, they're looking for something exciting. The Super Mario Bros. collaboration that we launched on Super Brand Day on Tmall has literally taken off. So newness, fun-ness is going to be important, I think. And we're very, very conscious of that as we plan the second half to make sure that we're leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make sure we've got newness on the floor when the consumer does come back."
61,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,61,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But I think what's going to happen here in the U.S., what's going to happen with the consumer, it's one of the big unknowns. And I kind of alluded to it right at the top. It's very difficult to forecast the future right now, not knowing how deep or how long this goes. I would say the deeper the economic impact is and the longer everybody is cooped up, the more of a shock there will be to the system. And it may take longer for the consumer to come back. That's why I think it's really important that we continue to build our relationship with the consumer during this period of time of isolation. We're not going to let them forget about Levi's while they're cooped up in their home. And so building that relationship, remaining authentic and true to who we are. I'm very excited, as you know, as you can tell, from this -- the concert series that we're doing. We're challenging ourselves. What are the other ""only Levi's could do that kind of thing"" type of moments?"
62,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,62,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But I still think there's a lot more we don't know than what we do know right now. And we just have to see how the situation unfolds. And -- but continue to play to our strengths and learn from China. And as other markets in Western Europe begin to come back, learn from Western Europe and just keep building our playbook as we go. So that's kind of how I think about it. But as I said, I mean, I do think there will be winners and losers here. And given the strength of our brand, consumers are going to want to come back to their favorites and to the brands that they trust and that they love. And so I think that positions us really well."
63,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,63,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,We have our next question from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey.
64,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,64,Dana Lauren Telsey,Telsey Advisory Group LLC,ANALYSTS,"Chip and Harmit, as you guys have been talking about obviously -- as you've been talking about the expense management underway, one of the buckets, obviously, is occupancy. How are you thinking and what are you seeing in terms of lease terms, either lease renegotiations out of your fleet around the world globally, whether outlet or full line? And I totally agree, there's a lot of opportunity for you to get some better locations, even smaller ones in the U.S. when all of this is said and done."
65,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,65,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Dana. Let me take a stab at that. We're in discussions, like most of other retailers, with landlords. And we are seeing success. I think we've got some great landlords, and they're being mindful of the situation. They like -- we were talking about the brand, they also want great brands. They also want great credit. And they want brands that are going to be here for the longer term. So we're working it case by case, and that's why I talked about it as an opportunity from an expense management perspective."
66,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,66,Harmit J. Singh,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We also have governments outside the U.S., the U.K., for example, in the fiscal stimulus, they have given an abatement on property tax as a holiday. And so we are leveraging that in different markets. And we're working with the White House and the different associations to try and bring similar practices in the U.S. as part of stimulus form. So I think we feel good about where we are. Obviously, it's difficult to generalize. But as Chip earlier mentioned, if you think about it long term, there probably will be vacancies. It gives us an opportunity to both expand floor space for stores that are really doing well as well as we grow mainline in the U.S. and grow mainline across the world, it gives us opportunities to get into type A locations."
67,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,67,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. I think we'll call it there. We apologize for going over a little bit longer, but there were clearly some technology challenges with a couple of questions. Anyway, thank you all for dialing in. We are in a once-in- a-century type of situation right now. And I just hope that you all will stay safe and keep your families safe and healthy. And we look forward to talking with you at the end of the next quarter. And hopefully, we'll be able to talk with more specifics in terms of what we expect for the balance of the year."
68,"Levi Strauss  Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,68,Charles Victor Bergh,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you all very much for dialing in, and take care of yourselves."
