0,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from [ Gregory Irvin ].
1,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,1,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Wow, what a difficult time?"
2,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,2,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Yes. For everyone.
3,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,3,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Let's see, where to begin? Number one, I hope we can get the Paycheck Protection loan, given that it's"
4,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,4,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We've made a combination of operating expense reductions, including targeted efficiency-oriented layoffs last year, and we continued those in the early part of this year. They were very selective and very targeted towards our efficiency goals. And those all preceded us coming to understand the potential and now real impacts of the COVID situation. Since we recognized the impacts of the COVID situation, we've since taken very specific nonefficiency-oriented, but very specific targeted short-term layoffs and furloughs related to match the level of business that we continue to see through March that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. So yes, we have."
5,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,5,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Would the ability to get the loan from the Paycheck Protection Program, would that cover -- I guess it wouldn't cover the layoffs or reductions that may have occurred last year, but the ones that you may have to implement now?"
6,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,6,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So again, all the actions we took that were specific to the current COVID-related situation, we took them short-term actions. The PPP program is giving us the ability to potentially receive some relief in the short term to potentially get us through the, I think in theory, the bulk of the potential impact to the market. So at least I believe that's what the government's intentions are. So our planning revolves directly around that intention of the program. And it also wraps directly around what we will be committed to the government in doing if we receive those funds, and that is to run the business, reverse all of the short-term-related actions that we have on our current staff and run the business at full capacity for the period to help relieve the pressure on the economy and work towards the stated goal of trying to get the economy recovered as quickly as possible. That is our plan, and all the actions that we've done in the short term related to furloughs and short-term layoffs are reversible with very short notice."
7,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,7,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Well, that's good to hear. Have -- in the cutback of operating expenses, have -- has that -- have you had to cut into the R&D that may affect the ability to design and roll out products -- needed products in the market?"
8,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,8,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We've done some, but we've been extremely careful to ensure that the impacts are minimal, and we've done a lot of work talking to our employees related to those reductions. They've been taken with incredible care to ensure that the impact is exactly what it's intended to be, which is very short term, very targeted and that we can recover rapidly after we see the ramp. When we can better predict what we think the ramp is going to look like on the other side of this, we'll be able to recover that capability as quickly as possible. I don't want to go into specific details, but we've done it in the smallest way possible and in the most careful way possible."
9,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,9,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The -- do we -- relatedly, do we have the products to match customer needs now? I know there was some discussion of this on the last call. Given that change, the technology transition that I assume is still occurring, are we still able, in the feedback that you get from customers and potential customers, able to meet their needs with the current product lines and the lines under development?"
10,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,10,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Well, we believe we are meeting their needs, and we're finishing up what we believe are the final sort of straggling features and functions of our NXG product line right now. Those extend to the support of traditional analog television for output on our NXG. They extend to some other sort of affiliated. Frankly, I'd wrap a lot of them up into sort of loose-ends category. The -- we'll be coming out with that capability approximately midyear. We're working on an HD-SDI capability. So all the remaining features and functions of NXG in particular are all based on specific, both large- and medium-sized, customer requests. So we know there's an immediate market for every one of those features and functions we're developing now and we'll be able to ship those products as soon as they're finished in the R&D cycle. So if you fast forward to the Q3 time frame, we're roughly expecting -- I cannot foresee any additional features and functions of NXG that will remain on the road map after Q3 this year, at the current time. So that really gets us to a big milestone, which is not that we can't sell NXG today, but -- because we are, and we're making great sales progress with customers. We're making good actual sales progress with customers. But there are those couple of loose ends that are sort of check, checks and check boxes that qualify us for finishing some sales cycles that we're in the middle of right now. I think beyond that then, we're mostly focused on wrapping up the transcoding features and functions. We launched a great product line at the end of last year called ClearView. That's been -- we've had a great initial success with that. A bunch of customers have lined up current and potential sales. So that's all looking good. So did I answer your question fully?"
11,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,11,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. What did you think will be the major drivers going forward as far as product lines go? I ask this might have shown incremental growth over the quarter, but failed to do so. That's why I ask what are you banking on as far as product lines go for growth over the next, let's say, the remainder of the year?"
12,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,12,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Right. So I'll break apart banking on versus upside potential. So what the company is banking on is that our newest video and data transmission equipment in the form of our NXG, our ClearView product, our BIDA products, our CMTS products and some other products show good signs of growth this year, and those are the things we're currently banking on in the current internal company forecasts and planning. The other products, such as CPE, bring a lot of strategic value. They have the potential for being an interesting business on their own. And we're working on those actively, but we're not relying on reluctant those to happen in order to fund the business or fund the growth."
13,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,13,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Going -- as you mentioned, going to the CPE sales, there was one sentence in your paragraph today that -- let me read that. It's provided a material -- it hasn't yet provided the material impact that's expected, but it's better positioned the company for future system sales versus individual or function-by-function sales. Could you elaborate a little more on that?"
14,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,14,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. I mean the history of the company -- put really simply, the history of the company has been to providing really high quality, high reliability, great value-oriented U.S.-built transmission equipment. And so when you're a systems operator like a big Tier 1 or Tier 2 cable or telco or municipal fiber company, you're delivering an entire system, you have to put a whole system together in order to deliver service to customers. And if you're delivering data services, you've got to look at how that data gets through either your HFC or your fiber optic network all the way to the customers' home, or in the case of wireless operators, they're doing that wirelessly in some cases. And if you're video -- if you're providing video services, you've got devices in the home. If you're providing data services, you've got some devices in the home as well. So they -- the operators who are the end users of our equipment, they think of their service offering as being delivered by a complete system. We've traditionally, as a company, picked -- choose -- chosen individual features and functions of that system that we believe we're particularly good at designing and building in mostly traditionally in the transmission side. And so it's in amplification and DOCSIS technology, and it's been encoding -- video encoding, MPEG encoding, audio encoding. We've picked different pieces, where we believe the higher value the company can bring to shareholders in the future is by positioning the company to have both the transmission side, the distribution side and some selective elements of the in-home side where there's a high value and a high sustainable business. So that way, when a customer looks at us -- a service operator customer looks at us, they see more of a company who is looking at the total picture and is more aware of the kind of challenges, technical challenges and financial and service operating challenges that, that customer has. So they tend to treat a systems provider with a little bit higher regard and a little bit closer relationship than they do individual companies who provide individual features and functions. So over the long term, that's where we're trying to do -- bring higher value and change the kind of relationships we have with the end decision-makers in the industry."
15,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,15,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I assume then that, that's meant some reorientation of marketing -- sales, marketing as well as manufacturing -- in-house manufacturing as you change your focus or your presentation to various customers?"
16,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,16,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"It's -- quite frankly, it has not been a huge change within the company, and the costs that we took on revenue. So -- I mean I think what we have -- what's helped us in that transmissions we -- in that transition, I should say, which is not complete yet. But what helped us through that change was we have a number of staff that have backgrounds at the systems level. So we already kind of had some untapped resources to apply from a knowledge base perspective in that area. Incrementally, we only added a few staff."
17,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,17,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Final question, I think final for now, is the write-down in inventory. Could you comfortably say what that was? What lines that was or that -- those were, and whether you anticipate anything approaching the significance of this write-down in the future?"
18,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,18,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Well, I'll tell you first, but I want to hand part of this off to Eric, but I want to make sure you understand. We've done significant efforts since we recognized this issue last year to make sure it will not happen again at this kind of level. So I can't give any guarantees, but we've taken significant efforts to focus our attention to the problem, reduce it, work specifically at the kind of operational activities that will, in the future, lend themselves towards the possibility that we have higher numbers of inventory turns on a yearly basis. And that's fundamentally the kind of -- the same kind of activities that will reduce our risk of being in that situation in the future. But to answer your specific questions on product lines, Eric, do you have some data you feel like you can..."
19,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,19,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Yes. I would prefer not to move down to the actual details of that. But I agree with everything that Ted said from a prospective basis that we take in steps necessary to assure that this level will not occur in the future if we're able to succeed our goals.
20,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,20,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Right. Well, it was obvious to me or seemingly, like, it was going to have to happen at some time because the inventory was just climbing over the last 3, 4, 5 quarters. So it's no great surprise. Just hope don't have anything as large as that again. And as you said, get things down to where the turnover is a little greater."
21,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,21,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"It's a critical metric going forward, it really is."
22,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,22,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Yes. Well, you'll have to excuse my -- I feel somewhat handicapped by not having the Q or the 10-K, but -- so -- but I assume that will be out before you report again in 5 or 6 weeks?"
23,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,23,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Yes.
24,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,24,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,Along with perhaps the proxy?
25,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,25,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"We're not sure of the timing of the proxy yet, but it will be -- the 10-K will be first and the proxy will be after that."
26,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,26,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] And it seems there are no more further questions at the moment. So therefore, I will hand it back over to Ted Grauch. Actually, I'm sorry, we do have one more question. We have a question from [ Lloyd Sim ]."
27,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,27,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,A question on the sublease. Where do we stand on that?
28,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,28,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"The sublease was executed, and it started in March and it's a 2-year deal. And so far, our tenant has been -- it's been successful."
29,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,29,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Okay. Good. And just on the SBA loan, what was the total dollar amount? Was it $7 million?"
30,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,30,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"$1.7 million, yes. It's a number just over $1.7 million, [ Lloyd ]."
31,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,31,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Okay. And I guess, looking -- so the initial tranche on this loan, it's on a 5-day look-back. So does that assume that we're somewhere in that $0.50 to $0.60 conversion rate, I guess?"
32,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,32,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Well, yes. We're in the process of compiling the data. So we just got to -- we want to make sure that we have the correct data before we talk about the exact pricing, but yes."
33,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,33,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Okay. And I'm just looking here. So did any of the management team participate in the loan, or is it just Board members?"
34,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,34,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"No, no, no, $1.7 million, $1.7 million."
35,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,35,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,$1.1 million?
36,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,36,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"It'd be 5 days prior to April 8, correct?"
37,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,37,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"That is correct. That's right, yes."
38,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,38,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Yes. They both did.
39,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,39,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes -- go ahead, Ted."
40,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,40,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I was just saying, both management and Board members, yes."
41,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,41,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Okay. Because I'm just looking at the 8-K here, I didn't see anyone on the management side. I don't know if it's under a different entity. I assume it is. Perhaps we can talk offline about that."
42,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,42,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Yes. It's -- there are different vehicles that were used to make the investment.
43,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,43,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Okay. Great. The -- so total amount here, 12% per annum -- have you thought about doing a shareholders' rights offering?"
44,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,44,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,No. We haven't.
45,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,45,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,How come?
46,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,46,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"We have -- we had to raise the money fairly quickly. A rights offering is a very expensive endeavor, and it requires mailing the shareholders and printing out the legal documents. Probably have to do an S-1/2, that's $0.25 million. That wasn't in -- that's not in the cards right now."
47,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,47,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"But you're going to be mailing out the proxy and the annual report anyway, so it could be contained as part of that, correct?"
48,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,48,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. But an S-1 filing is a different story. There's all kinds of reps and warranties and legal work that goes in that. It's a minimum cost of $0.25 million to file an S-1, and that's what you'd have to do for a rights offering."
49,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,49,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"In terms of allowing your shareholders to participate, I guess, in the upside without getting the dilution, any suggestions there or anything that you'd be looking at?"
50,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,50,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Well, accredited investors, we have an investment banking firm that is handling this for us. And if there's an accredited investor that meets the criteria of participating in a Reg D offering, that investment banker can contact that individual or that institution."
51,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,51,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,Okay. Maybe you can supply that information?
52,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,52,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"I can, but I don't want to do it on this call."
53,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,53,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,No. I understand.
54,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,54,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,So you can call us afterwards if you meet that criteria.
55,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,55,Operator,,,And it looks like we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Ted Grauch.
56,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,56,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Great. Thank you for the questions. And so I'll kind of wrap up here. As we have in prior years, myself and the whole management team and the Board would really like to thank all the dedicated Blonder Tongue Labs' team members for their continued efforts and accomplishments, especially for continuing to work through these very difficult current COVID-related circumstances that have been impacting everyone in the company in different ways. It is the Blonder Tongue people that are responsible for our fantastic product reputation, our product, high reliability, great technology and overall value."
57,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,57,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Thank you all for participating in the Blonder Tongue financial reporting teleconference today. We look forward to speaking with you at the next teleconference. Thank you.
58,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,58,Edward Rowland Grauch,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
59,"Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,59,Eric S. Skolnik,"Senior VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Thanks very much.
