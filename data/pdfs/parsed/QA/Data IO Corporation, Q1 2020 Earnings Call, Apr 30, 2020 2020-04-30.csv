0,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street.
1,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Just curious if you could comment what you're seeing from an order pattern standpoint in the month of April compared to the end of March?
2,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Jaeson, that's a good question. I won't get too quantitative. I'll just say this. We're not seeing the end of the world out there, okay? People are still buying things. CapEx was down in Q1. When we put our internal numbers and forecast together for Q2, we assume CapEx would be impacted as well. But it's not the end of the world. We've definitely seen an impact, but it's not like we've fallen off a cliff or anything."
3,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I know in the script, you mentioned an order for an electronics manufacturer in the ventilator market. Just curious if this is more of a one-off win? Or if you've seen sort of sustained inbound interest from the health care medical market as a whole?"
4,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, we we haven't talked too much about in the past. We actually have a pretty good medical business. We haven't broken it out. It's been considered part of our industrial business up till now, which is run between, I don't know, Joel, 20% and 25% of our overall business for several years in that range."
5,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It fluctuates, 15% to 25%."
6,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And then probably more in the programming centers as well. But we called out the specific win because, number one, we put together a program for medical customers to make sure that they could quickly repurpose equipment to support new medical needs. That's actually one of the big advantages of the Data I/O technology is, with our pre programming, you can convert from a part that might be supporting a ventilation system in a car, and in 30 minutes, you can be reprogramming now to support a ventilator for a hospital. We can convert the line that quickly. And so a customer came to us, they had a problem. They'd actually prototyped on a alternative programming solution and found that the performance was terrible. They came to us with LumenX, and we were able to get them about an 8x performance game. And they move very rapidly to place an order with us and get that to support their ramp. And the end customer, we don't have the permission to use their name. But if you Google big government orders of ventilators, you can figure out 1 of the 2 companies."
7,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our next question will come from Pete James with LJ Capital.
8,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Can you discuss the margin profile by revenue type for capital equipment sales, adapters, maintenance and software upgrades and per click fees for SentriX programming, please?"
9,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I won't go into too much detail. But in general, the software obviously carries higher margins. Services tend to carry pretty good margins as well. The capital equipment, it really depends on not only the type of system ordered, but the channel. And I'll give you an example. So if we sell-through a direct sales channel, we'll tend to have a higher gross margin and also a higher sales expense because we'll pay commissions. If we sell-through a distributor, we'll have a lower gross margin on that equipment because we provide the equipment at a discount to the distributor. At the same time, our sales commissions will be much lower because the commission has been taken in the form of a product discount. So it's fairly variable. But within those broad parameters, that's the pattern of our business."
10,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. I had one other question as well. You've mentioned the transition from eMMC to UFS, can you talk more about what this means in the automotive electronics sector with near and longer-term perspectives? And where your technology stand relative to what else is available in the market from your competitors?"
11,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So as you know, the semiconductor industry from time-to-time adopts certain standards for widely used components such as flash memory. eMMC was that broadly deployed standard in the PC industry, the mobile phone industry, automotive electronics for the better part of a decade. Starting in mobile phones, probably 3 or 4 years ago, there was a transition to a new form of memory interface, called UFS. Without drilling down too far, it provides a much higher read capability, a much better nonsequential read capability, meaning if you switch around from application-to-application, you get the data faster. And it also is able to operate at lower power. That was very attractive for the mobile phone industry, and they adopted it first. And as the industry, in general, move towards UFS, the cost patterns and reliability characteristics were consistent with what was required for the automotive industry. And they've been moving a lot of the high-density flash memory applications such as infotainment, in Dash computing, displays, things like that, to UFS. That's actually very good for Data I/O because we're one of the handful of suppliers that can actually program us in the market. eMMC, pretty much anybody could do it. We did it better, of course, because it's much faster. But right now, we're 1 of 2 or 3 suppliers that have announced the capability to support UFS. And when we're able to sit down with customers, we can explain why our approach has some very important technical benefits that maybe some others don't. So the move to UFS, we view generally is very favorable to Data I/O because we have a unique technology position. And also, very cost-effective for the customer."
12,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our next question will come from George Melas with MKH Management.
13,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,George Melas-Kyriazi,"MKH Management Company, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Anthony, you mentioned in the press release and also in your remarks that you had won 3 -- you have 3 new automotive wins in Asia, America and Europe. That seems pretty impressive. Can you talk a little bit about that? I don't know how much detail you can provide, but how big those are? And I imagine these are competitive wins."
14,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Exactly, George. And I called it out specifically for that. What was otherwise a pretty dismal quarter for capital purchases. People just were not adding capacity. There's still nonetheless, new applications. We talked about infotainment. We've talked about advanced driver assist. One of them was also in the area of electrification, okay? Which is a nice win for us. We hope it's the start of something very nice long term. We'll see how it plays out. But we've instructed our sales team to continually to go after not only the customers they know, but to pursue the new applications. And the good news is in automotive, there are a lot of new applications, and we have a very good reputation in that industry."
15,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Okay. Can you explain a little bit what electrification means? What kind of application is that?
16,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,So battery-powered cars.
17,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Okay. And is that some of your first win in that space or not?
18,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"No, it's not the first one, George. But you would recognize the customer's name."
19,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Great. Great. That's great news. Well done. It's amazing to get new customers in this environment. Quick question about services and maintenance sales, that has held up quite well. Can you help us -- you sort of remind us kind of what that is? And how is that holding up as well?"
20,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, that includes things that are not capital equipment purchases and not adapter sales. So for example, we offer software contracts. We have customers pay us NRE to do development of algorithms and other things like that. We have maintenance agreements and things like that. And of course, SentriX falls in there as well. Okay? And it tends to be a little more stable because we'll tend to get an order for an annual contract, and we'll make up -- if it there was $12,000 for a contract, we take a PO for $12,000 and then amortize it $1,000 a month. So it tends to be fairly stable."
21,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Okay. Great. Great. And then just on SentriX. Can you sort of point if there is any sort of meaningful progress in the quarter or some relationships that are deepening? And how do you expect centric to play out in 2020?
22,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, the interesting thing about SentriX is, you'd be hard-pressed to -- if you looked at our inbound activity to understand there was any COVID-19 effect going on at all. We unfortunately lost a couple of our marketing venues that we were planning on in Q1 and also in Q2 and Q3. A trade show is not likely to be a good thing from a marketing perspective, maybe for the rest of the year, certainly through probably September. So we're looking at other ways to promote it. The -- we've had good progress working with semiconductor suppliers, good progress on the underlying technology, good progress on new device supports and good progress on end customers and channel partners coming in with new opportunities."
23,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Mark Spiegel with Stanphyl Capital.
24,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,Mark B. Spiegel,Stanphyl Capital Management,ANALYSTS,"Well, as you -- you may remember, we're value guys. And so we sold basically the stock on the way up, but we're in pretty good now. So here's my question, and it's a general question. How much of your business is dependent on the volume of the end product. And in other words, let's just say hypothetically that they were using your machine to program the new Mercedes S Class. And because automotive sales are going to be terrible this year, they sell, I don't know, 80,000 of them instead of 100,000, does that affect you guys? Or do you basically just sell them the tool and after that, it's -- it doesn't really matter how many of them they sell?"
25,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, we're somewhat insulated on volume, but we're not immune to volume effects. So automotive sales being potentially down would definitely have an impact on the people that buy for capacity. Okay? And -- but as we mentioned earlier, we had 3 new wins, primarily where there was new technology involved. So for example, if you're making a major model changeover and you're adding a lot of new features, they have to put in place the capability to produce the car, whether they produce as many as the guys forecast 6 months ago or not. Now what we are seeing is customers that may be buying to a certain volume level or thought they were and they were cutting back their forecast. They're still going to buy, but maybe they don't buy as much. Maybe they try and squeeze out 2 machines instead of adding a third, that type of thing. So we're not immune. But in general, it's volume. But also remember, it's the amount of bits programmed so if the feature set doubles the amount of software code, then we've got to program twice as many bits, which means programming demand goes up. And then finally, the type of bits really matter. Security obviously carries quite a premium over standard programming. So yes, it will have an impact. No, it's not 100% deterministic and there are other factors involved."
26,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"How many machines do you typically sell for a given model? I mean is it like 1 machine can handle 100,000 cars and -- or 50 or 30? I just -- I don't have a grasp of that, really."
27,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,27,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It really depends on the application. For example, if you're talking to infotainment, you might need a couple of machines to support infotainment. And remember, we're working with the electronics models from one end customer or many models from different end customers. So it's hard to draw a one- to-one correlation that I think you're looking for. I just can't give that to you."
28,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,28,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, is your typical -- last question, is your typical order multiple machines to the same customer for the same application? So they might need five. And in this case, they only buy four. I mean is it something like that? It's not just 1 machine per application?"
29,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,29,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think the typical order is probably -- depending on how you define applications, probably 1 or 2 per applications. But over time, the factories end up with multiple versions of our equipment, because they're dealing with mutiple model years, multiple applications, et cetera. Of course, [Indiscernible] goes back and forth."
30,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,30,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, that they couldn't avoid that. So if there's a new model year, are they forced to buy a new machine, or -- I'm trying to -- I guess, it goes back to my original question. I'm wondering, and I know you said it's not one-for-one, but let's say the auto market is down now 25% this year, what would that typically -- well, I understand things get more complicated and you do more programming. I mean off the top of your head, what does that do to your automotive business? Is it down 5%, 10%? Is it flat because there's more programming going on? I mean I'm just trying to get a grasp of that."
31,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,31,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. That kind of number wouldn't be good. I'll just put it that way. I would probably have a disproportionate impact in the capital equipment. We'd still sell adapters. We'd still sell services, things like that. But the -- it's not a one-for-one correlation. And I don't know that I can give you a whole lot more detail authoritatively right now."
32,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,32,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Last question, I know I said the other one was. You said things are not falling off a cliff, but they're being affected. The quarter you just reported is sort of off a cliff a small -- if anyway, relative to the year ago quarter. Do you see this, let's call it, low level of activity continuing? Or is it worse than this?"
33,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,33,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I think from an automotive perspective, I think the electronics industry bottomed out, probably, April was the bottom, just in terms of their overall impact. They're telling us they're going to be reopening. We've been getting supplier letters, giving us some guidance on what their ramps are so the auto factories appear to be reopening in Europe and the United States. I understand middle of next month. So that's a good sign. And generally, they closed probably the third week of March. So that would be a 2-month hiatus. So we're going to have to work through that. And they're not going to come back to 100% right away. So the range of forecast that we're looking at is extremely wide. And that's why we've taken steps to be ready, save our cash. But at the same time, if it turns around quickly, we want to be ready."
34,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,34,Unknown Shareholder,,ANALYSTS,"Well, okay. So again, I'll try to pin you down a little and you can try to unpin yourself."
35,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,35,Unknown Shareholder,,ANALYSTS,"Our next question will come from Mike Donovan, Private Investor."
36,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,36,Unknown Shareholder,,ANALYSTS,"Anthony and Joel, I trust you and your families or safe. I'm a longtime shareholder. My question is around, I think, a SentriX, specifically. And it has felt like over time or at least at the outset, that the sort of the picture around SentriX was one of a machine centric some reconfiguring going on, some relationships developed with the semiconductor companies in terms of provisioning, and then a little -- a different business model, not a little bit of a different business model, a very different business model in terms of pricing per unit versus the CapEx. In some of the recent documents I've read, I read this term security deployment as a service. I also follow some of the headcount and the personnel, the advertisements you have for skill sets that you're looking to hire. And I guess by trying to jump to the end, my sense is you've learned a lot about the needs for security in the marketplace and your strategy and your execution approach is shifting. Would that be a correct assessment on my part? And if so, what can you share about what you're seeing in terms of what customers actually need beyond the equipment?"
37,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,37,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I think you raised some good points there. And remember, as we learn our positioning the market gets refined, we have a very strong Head of Marketing and Business development, Michael Tidwell, who brings more of a software frame of mind to the table. And so he's been able to adjust our product positioning accordingly. To get to the basics, what we talked about last quarter was the need to have, what we call simplify and scale. The premise that people need security, I think, is being more and more understood at a slow pace, okay, admittedly, but people are getting with the program on security. The big challenge is how do they want to do it? And what can they afford? And what's the type of customer profile that we can best support. And what we've discovered is customers want the whole security process end-to-end to be simplified. We don't control that entire process. We work with a number of partners and with the whole goal of being to simplify it. And I'd be happy to walk you through the 100 or so parameters you could decide to change on a fully configured secure element, and it would take us a month to figure out what you wanted to do on that. Or you could simply say, I want to onboard this device to the cloud when it turns on, or I want to authenticate it when it turns on and make sure that I can manage software updates in a secure manner. And so what we're trying to do is explain to customers as well, if that's what you want, then picked this pre-configured option over here or we've got a use case for you or a profile that might make more sense. And so we've begun the process of educating customers on -- and hopefully speaking their language is a little bit better than we have in the past. And that's really what I think you're seeing on SentriX."
38,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,38,Unknown Shareholder,,ANALYSTS,And SentriX falls underneath this 18% of revenues when you look at a portfolio split between CapEx and adapters and software.
39,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,39,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Our next question will come from Avi Fisher with Long Cast Advisers.
40,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,40,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"I'm sorry to mention this, how many SentriX units are deployed?"
41,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,41,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Okay. 5. And are you offering any onetime discounts or financing options?
42,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,42,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"No. It's an interesting point. We're really trying to be frugal with our cash right now. If I thought we're going to go jump in and out of a v-shaped or section or something, I might get more aggressive on something like that. We're going to choose to keep our powder dry at least for a little while."
43,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,43,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Awesome. And one last question. This is our third straight quarter of growing consumables revenue. And I'm just trying to understand what takeaway to read from that. It seems like I know SentriX is in that line
44,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,44,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,That's correct.
45,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,45,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We still have 5 deployed, Avi."
46,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,46,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Avram Fisher item, but I'm not sure that's material yet. I know it reflects capacity utilization by some of your customers. Is there anything you can offer to help understand this sort of positive trend?"
47,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,47,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It's a positive trend. But I would caution you not to draw too much or infer too much. We're in crazy times right now. And as I've indicated before, the numbers in any 1 quarter can bounce around. It's clearly a trend we want. We want the recurring revenue to go up. That's part of the business strategy behind SentriX. And obviously, SentriX is contributing to that. But the -- what I'm saying is don't read too much too fast."
48,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,48,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Is it growing because of SentriX? Or is it probably just because your customers are using programming a little bit more and using more of your product?
49,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,49,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think it's growing because as a percentage, remember, the CapEx has gone down as well."
50,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,50,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"The other thing that clouds that a little bit was we had a very rough Q3 in terms of our business levels. And you saw that, that's been recovering since then."
51,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,51,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,Correct. So that's a growing use of -- but that's a growth -- does that mean your customers have worked off the excess inventory they had?
52,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,52,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"I think it -- what I'm saying, Avi, is don't draw too many conclusions over the last 3 quarters."
53,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,53,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Fair enough. And yes, it's coming off of a very low base as well, which I'm aware of. But I appreciate the color."
54,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,54,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"At this time, I'm showing no more questions in the question queue. This will conclude our question- and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Anthony Ambrose for any closing remarks."
55,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,55,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,May 18.
56,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,56,Anthony Ambrose,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you very much, Grant. As there are no further questions, I'd like to close the call by thanking everyone for their participation today. I'd also like to remind everyone to vote electronically in the upcoming shareholder meeting May 18, Joel?"
57,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,57,Joel S. Hatlen,"Chief Operating & Financial Officer, VP of Operations & Finance, Treasurer and Secretary",EXECUTIVES,May 18. And I hope everyone remains safe and productive. Thank you very much.
58,"Data IO Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,58,Operator,,,The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
