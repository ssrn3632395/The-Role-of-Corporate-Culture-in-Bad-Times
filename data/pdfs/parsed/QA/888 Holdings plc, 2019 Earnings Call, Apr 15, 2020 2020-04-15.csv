0,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] The first comes from Ted Nyhan from JPMorgan.
1,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,1,Ted Nyhan,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Just a couple of questions from me. What is the -- your current outlook for the German casino business in the context of the new interstate treaty and some of the restrictions that are in that?
2,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,2,Ted Nyhan,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And in terms of M&A, do you think that activity is likely during the COVID period? Or is this something for more the medium term and finally, I suppose, is there -- what's your outlook for gaming duties in FY '20, so from either new markets or tax increases?"
3,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,3,Ted Nyhan,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So Aviad, do you want to answer -- would you like to answer those questions?"
4,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,4,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"I will give it my best, Itai. As we know, Germany was supposed to regulate sports betting on an interim basis until July '21. When the new regime comes into place, as we all know, last week, an Austrian company filed a challenge to the sports betting licensing process and the various arguments, including lack of transparency. A court basically granted suspension of that regime, and these sport licenses are not going to be issued immediately."
5,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,5,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We are aware that the authorities are going to appeal, and that appeal process can take anywhere from 2 to 6 or 7, 8 months. So we don't really know what's going to happen to the sport regime. Remember, this is an interim regime. And potentially, this could have implications on the casino regime under the new treaty from July '21. So I know it's not exactly the answer that you wanted, but there is uncertainty there. I think more delays are more likely than not than a week ago, and we're just going to have to follow very closely the development there. I think it was also widely held that even if the sports interim regime were to continue, there was a widely held belief that the casino regime under the new treaty would also be challenged on all sorts of ground. So the answer is we don't really know. Current status quo continues."
6,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,6,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The last question was about changing gaming duties in 2020. At the moment, I'm not aware of changing regulate towards the second half of next year, they will impose a 29% GGR tax. And that is as much as I know at the moment. And I think I probably missed your second question, Ted. So apologies, would you be able to repeat?"
7,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,7,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Yes. I'll answer the third one...
8,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,8,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. M&A, it's..."
9,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,9,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, M&A. I'll take that question, Ted. So yes. So I think M&A activity obviously takes time. Nothing can happen there immediately, but I do think the current situation and companies that are in a less fortunate position than ours, and even companies that are in good position, I think this will initiate some new M&A opportunities and processes in the near future, so I think the processes will start quite early on. But again, the processes usually take a bit time, so I don't think they'll end in the near future. But I definitely feel that there are going to be some opportunities that crop up in the next few weeks or very early months."
10,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,10,Operator,,,Next question on the line is from Simon Davies from Deutsche Bank.
11,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,11,Simon John Davies,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A few from me, please. Firstly, you've seen a remarkable shift towards a recreational player base in the U.K. Can you flesh out your comments a bit on that in terms of what is your definition of a VIP, given that revenues are now less than 5% coming from VIPs? What has happened to average lifetime value for customer over the last 18 months? And can you give an indication of what you think average stake is a slot spin at the moment?"
12,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,12,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Aviad, would you like to take that question?"
13,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,13,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"With pleasure. Simon, what we see is -- we definitely saw last year a reduction in lifetime value. That is -- goes hand-in-hand with the fact that only 4% of Casino revenue in the U.K. was generated by VIPs. It was accompanied by a very significant increase in FTDs. So the ratio, if you like, of lifetime value to CPA remain constant. That is the, really, real profitability at the atomic level."
14,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,14,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So CPA went down, lifetime as well went down, and we're very happy with that trend. I can also report that what we have seen over the past several weeks is that we have seen actually even more recreational players coming back to Poker, which was kind of a less loved product in the last several years. And into Casino, where our much lower CPAs, much lower lifetime value, and that is the major difference that we see in the last few weeks in that respect."
15,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,15,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We don't disclose exactly the threshold, Simon, of what is the VIP and the reason is that there is no exact definition across the industry. But they are clearly the higher payer values, but we're not talking about huge obscene amounts. We're just talking people that are not just recreational and spending a few hundred pounds, it's more than that, but it's not a huge amount."
16,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,16,Simon John Davies,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,And what about average spend take?
17,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,17,Simon John Davies,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Less than GBP 2, on average?"
18,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,18,Simon John Davies,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I don't particularly see a change. I would probably -- I know at least for the Poker, that there is more widespread use of the lower tables, which are clearly the recreational tables, the recreational value on a Poker tournament where you can play for hours on just putting a few dollars in. It's very prevalent or even a free roll so we can clearly see that in the poker. Potentially, because of the recreational players and slots in the U.K., probably lower. But it was lower even before, so it's not a huge difference."
19,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,19,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Clearly, there's a big chunk, which is less than GBP 2. Yes."
20,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,20,Simon John Davies,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And secondly, just on regulated revenue streams, obviously, it's at 74% in 2019. What do you think the run rate is now in Q1 2020?"
21,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,21,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Itai, I'll answer that."
22,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,22,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Yes. Please go ahead.
23,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,23,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. We certainly see significant growth across our regulated markets this year, even before the eventualities of the COVID, we certainly see growth in Italy, Romania, places like Sweden and a bit in the U.K. as well. And we certainly see that trend continues, and I suspect if it will continue at this rate, this year, we will report a higher proportion than the 74% of last year."
24,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,24,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In unregulated markets, predominantly Germany, went down significantly last year. We did not put focus in that market because of the regulatory changes. There was also an impact of payment methods. It's basically the correct trajectory, more regulated and less unregulated."
25,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,25,Operator,,,The next question is from David Brohan from Goodbody.
26,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,26,David Brohan,"Goodbody Stockbrokers UC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just 2 questions for me. One just on the Poker, the European liquidity network. What countries are in this? And are there plans to add more over kind of 2020 and 2021?"
27,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,27,David Brohan,"Goodbody Stockbrokers UC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,And then just on the U.S. What are the key objectives for the U.S. business in 2020? And are you seeing strong uplifts in Casino and Poker currently where the Sports is off the table?
28,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,28,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I'll answer those questions. So at the moment in the shared liquidity network in Europe for us is Spain and Portugal, where we had -- Spain was almost a duopoly for a few years until some competitors joined through shared liquidity network, specifically from France. So today, Poker -- in the European Poker liquidity network is a bit more competitive or the Spanish market is a bit more competitive."
29,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,29,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Currently, we have, like I said, Portugal, Italy, said or announced that they will join the shared liquidity network, but it hasn't happened yet. We're still hopeful that this will happen in the future because we have Poker in Italy, so connecting that to the existing game network can only be beneficial for us, and we believe for the network, overall, for the shared liquidity network."
30,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,30,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And the next market that we're not in at the moment is France, which we are considering to enter at some point of time, but we don't have a specific time line for that yet."
31,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,31,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So that's Poker. And in U.S. and actually, elsewhere, we are seeing a growth in both Casino and Poker in recent weeks after sports betting became -- basically it's not unavailable, but it's very, very limited, and the U.S. is representing similar trends."
32,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,32,Operator,,,The next question is from Ivor Jones from Peel Hunt.
33,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,33,Ivor Jones,"Peel Hunt LLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Perhaps I'll just ask questions one at a time, so I don't forget the answers. You've talked about revenue year-to-date. Could you just talk about from costs? Is the market that you would have spent in sports being retargeted to the other products? Or is marketing spend down? And I think you've touched on this, but if I guess Casino is now a more competitive space, so is it getting more difficult to get a return on those CPAs?"
34,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,34,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So the marketing spend for sports definitely decreased. And like I said before, a lot of our marketing is based on online and performance in marketing that is also related to the amount of demand that's coming our way. So if there are more people searching for online poker or online casino on Google, and we are paying on a pay-per-click basis, then our marketing costs are increasing overall, but on an average, we are seeing a reduction. But overall, I would say that these times, there's going to be more marketing because of higher demand in Casino and Poker, which are our biggest verticals and Bingo. And sports is obviously offsetting that, some of the savings that we're making in sports. But overall, marketing will probably grow these days."
35,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,35,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,And retaining its efficiency? Or should we worry about competition -- increased competition for Casino?
36,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,36,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We don't see a problem in competition. We always have competition in Casino, and not much have changed. If you're referring to competitors that were active in Sports shifting budgets to Casino, it's always been a very competitive space, online casino. We are performing effectively there. I think the bigger question is lifetime values. If they maintain as they were in the past because of potential, things like recession that are coming and less ability of customers to spend. At the moment, we aren't seeing a significant decline in values. We are seeing an increase in marketing dollars through CPAs, but the average"
37,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,37,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"CPAs are not going up, even slightly going down."
38,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,38,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Can I ask you about what happens when sports comes back? I guess that there's going to be very competitive marketing from the sports-led brand. Will -- should we just assume 888 will lose market -- some of its market share that it's gained because it will be too expensive to recover customers, and it will be a slower recovery than the obvious leading sports brands? What's the plan for the return of sports?"
39,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,39,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"I think we've been quite consistent in growing sports over the last few years. And because we're growing, it's now a vertical that's worth over $100 million. And for us, it's becoming a very significant vertical for us, but I think our base is always lower than the other, so we have more room for growth at the moment."
40,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,40,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"I assume that the big and more reliant sports operator will come back quite strong when they come back in terms of marketing, but I don't think we're going to lose share. We'll at least maintain share, if not, the growth with the launch of the new products because products and product experiences also have to do with growth in the verticals. And as I mentioned before, we're launching our new product. We're planning to launch additional features."
41,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,41,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Overall, our ambition is to have a better experience and a better product, so we're not projecting a decline in sports when it comes back. If anything, customers who have not been active for a long time, I think they will be more active when it comes back."
42,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,42,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And could we talk about Slide 22 that shows business momentum and deposit trends? I just want to check on some -- what I'm looking at. Is that deposits in monetary and dollar value against the base level? It's not number of players, is it?"
43,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,43,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"No, that's actual deposits in dollars. Correct, Aviad?"
44,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,44,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,And up to what time period is it showing? I can't quite tell from this exactly.
45,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,45,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Correct. Yes.
46,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,46,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,It's right at the end of Q1.
47,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,47,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,This is including February. Yes.
48,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,48,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So I think one of you said February, and one of you said Q1?"
49,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,49,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"No. Sorry, sorry, yes. Whenever you ask about numbers, Aviad is always right. So if we both answered, he's always right."
50,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,50,Ivor Jones,"Peel Hunt LLP, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Sorry, and Aviad, what was the answer?"
51,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,51,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"In this case, actually, Itai was right. It is the end of Q1."
52,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,52,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So pretty recently, and a pretty unusual spike for that period. What does your trading statement today tell us then that, that trajectory carried on to April? There was further growth year-over-year in the first part of April?"
53,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,53,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Our trading statement from the 24th of March stated that we increased in revenue. Average daily revenue was 18% increase in Q1 '19, and we said today that this trend continues. So we see the same trends as we saw then, and that was it."
54,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,54,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Not necessarily an acceleration that, that chart might imply. Okay."
55,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,55,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And lastly, you said that B2B had started well. And I just want to make sure I understood what that meant. B2B year-over-year is lost Cashcade?"
56,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,56,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Correct.
57,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,57,Operator,,,Right? You got that the right way around? So you're talking about B2B growing Q1 on Q4 last year?
58,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,58,Operator,,,"Yes. The existing -- the remaining B2B, excluding Cashcade, obviously."
59,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,59,Operator,,,"So on a year-over-year basis, it's been growing on a like-for-like product."
60,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,60,Operator,,,The next question from the line is from Simon French of Canaccord.
61,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,61,Simon James French,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Three for me, please. Firstly, just on the sports book, could you outline what the next markets will be for the rollout of the proprietary sports book once you've bedded down Sweden?"
62,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,62,Simon James French,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then secondly, on the balance sheet, did I hear you say, Aviad, that you had $42 million of net cash as of last week? And when does the RCFs with Barclays mature, please?"
63,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,63,Simon James French,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then thirdly, on Bingo, in the last slide, in the appendices, there's some charts relating to 888ladies and Costa. Specifically looking at Costa, what have been the lessons you've learned from that experience of buying in that customer from the B2B customer base? And does that give you confidence to look to pick up other, perhaps, struggling businesses in that segment over the next few months?"
64,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,64,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So I'll take the Sports and Bingo, and I'll let Aviad take the net cash and RCF. So starting with sports, I mentioned this, the next market that we're planning to launch is the U.K., which is the biggie, that's a significant part of our sports and probably the most competitive sports market, sports betting market globally. So as you can see, there's quite a big period between Sweden and the U.K. So first of all, we're launching Sweden as kind of the first, what we call test market. We'll see that everything there is working well, that it's stable, that customers are happy with the product."
65,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,65,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We have a few more U.K. style features and actually innovations that we're developing towards the launch in the U.K., which is supposed to happen, I would say, towards the end of Q4 this year. And alongside with the U.K., we will be launching some more of our dot com markets or yet to be regulated markets. I don't have the exact list at the moment, but there will be some more markets launched before the end of this year."
66,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,66,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So that's -- yes, one second, I'm just about the Bingo. So ladies, I'm just trying to get to that slide. But ladies, what we did, we relaunched -- we basically relaunched the brand. It's not a new platform, it's just like a brand uplift, I would call it, a refreshment. We haven't invested a lot in ladies for a few years now. And we saw very good response, specifically in terms of the FTDs since the launch of Bingo, I think the slide that you're referring to is the FTDs."
67,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,67,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, new customers trend since the launch of ladies. So it's quite stable in the last couple of years, and I think it's a very good and strong response for a relaunch of a brand, and it shows, I think, the strong affinity to 888 overall as a group and specifically to 888ladies, which is a brand that has a lot of heritage. It's the first brand that we launched in the U.K. after we acquired the Globalcom platform. It has very many loyal players and now, a lot of new players that joined through kind of the uplift of the brand that we recently did."
68,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,68,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"And Costa, you can also see the trend of new players in 2020. So like I said before, Costa was a brand that didn't enjoy a lot of investment in the last couple of years of its life with its previous owner. We saw that as an opportunity to, again, take this over, slightly uplift the brand, reinvest in it because, again, it's one of the kind of household Bingo brands in the U.K. and it's working over our platform."
69,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,69,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So there's a lot of synergy in this acquisition, and we are making learnings. And if more of these opportunities will come our way, I think we will definitely consider them positively, depending, obviously, on the terms that they come in. But I think it definitely wasn't a bad experience."
70,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,70,Simon James French,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And historically, Costa was very reliant on bonusing, I seem to remember. Have you managed to move the brand away from that?"
71,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,71,Simon James French,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, absolutely. And that's one of the challenges that we had. We had to adjust it to kind of our way of operating brands, and players were used to previous kind of brand management, including a lot of bonusing. We -- in general, we reduced level of bonusing in general, and in these days, specifically, and that's part of the process that we did in Costa Bingo. And I think, over time, we'll see the effect of that in more positive contribution."
72,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,72,Simon James French,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I'll take the other 2 questions, Simon. So our revolving credit facility with Barclays was down to 3-year period. It's about 1 year old now, so there's 2 more years to run. And in terms of our liquidity for last Friday, which was Good Friday, it was a very good day, indeed, our net cash -- net corporate cash was $42 million last Friday."
73,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,73,Operator,,,The next question is from Richard Stuber from Numis.
74,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,74,Richard Paul Stuber,"Numis Securities Limited, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Two for me, please. I was wondering, in terms of your U.S. strategy, quick for growth, it sounds like you're investing more in the U.S. this year. I guess -- basically, could you give me some sort of guidance in terms of what sort of losses you expect from the U.S.? And presumably, this is just on this, the organic strategy? You wouldn't be able to comment if it's any other way? That's my first question."
75,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,75,Richard Paul Stuber,"Numis Securities Limited, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And the second question is in terms of investment in safer gaming initiatives, you've obviously been spending quite a lot last year. Any sort of guidance in terms of how much that is in dollar terms? And do you expect to further increase investments in safer gambling for this year, too?"
76,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,76,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So I'll start with the U.S. So we've actually announced that we're looking to lose up to high single- digit millions of dollars in the U.S. this year, about $8 million. And that's through our organic strategy, which requires more marketing to build our brand, to acquire new customers. I think that's quite a natural trend going into a new market. Obviously, America has a lot of submarkets and opportunities in it. And I think the investment, the organic investment will be required for us and for other operators over the next few years. It's not a one-off."
77,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,77,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So that's the U.S. and safer gaming initiative, so we don't mention how much we spend per product, just like we don't announce how much we spend on Poker 8 or on Orbit or our on our new sports betting platform. But it is a considerable amount of our resources that are being deployed to creating responsible gaming tools, but not only to creating the tools and the alert systems, but also to making them more approachable and intuitive and easy-to-use for our customers."
78,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,78,Itai Pazner,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So the projects that we're going to be launching, the bigger projects that we're going to be launching this year is our stake zone, which is basically a front-end product for all the game -- all the responsible gaming tools and options that our customers have, where we are directing our customers through the campaign, through our alerting system, and that will be the main investment in this year's product delivery around responsible gaming."
79,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,79,Richard Paul Stuber,"Numis Securities Limited, Research Division",ANALYSTS,I see. And are these tools offered to customers across all your geographies? Or these are mainly the U.K. base of gambling tools?
80,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,80,Operator,,,"They're offered across all geographies, but each market has specific -- some markets have specific requirements that we deploy in those markets. So the safer zone in the U.K. will not look identical as in Spain or in Italy or in other markets."
81,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,81,Operator,,,The next question is from Bridie Barrett from Stifel.
82,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,82,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"In fact, you answered pretty much all of my questions. But if I could just clarify your last point on the U.S. business, did you say that the net loss was $8 million last year, you expect the same again this year despite of the fact that you're expecting to launch in full state and probably again in 2021, did I get that right?"
83,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,83,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Not exactly. I'll make myself clearer. Last year, we lost less than $8 million. We lost -- Aviad, did we -- did we announce..."
84,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,84,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"We didn't, but we have no secrets. We lost on the U.S. B2C almost $3 million in '19."
85,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,85,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And the expectation for this year is around $8 million. Again, depending on the level of the marketing investments. So now obviously, we're going to spend less because sports is not happening. So we're not going to spend on Sport. But this is for the existing markets in the U.K., the plan to launch additional markets, B2C markets because we also launched B2B markets through our partnership with Caesars. But on the B2C side, the plan to go into more markets is probably only going to happen early next year."
86,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,86,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So that $8 million that I mentioned is for B2C activity this year in New Jersey -- in America, sorry. And next year, when we go into further markets, New Jersey, hopefully, will pick up in terms of revenue, but we will need to continue investing in further markets. So the U.S. is a long-term investment cycle as more and more markets open and require launching, penetrating, building brands, et cetera."
87,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,87,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's clear. And just as you mentioned, Caesars, as it stands today, does that relationship feel secure following the Eldorado deal?"
88,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,88,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. We haven't heard anything that gives us a sense of insecurity. If anything, the other way around, we're looking to launch into Pennsylvania, WSOP Poker. I can share that like Poker everywhere else in the world in the markets that are regulated and available currently in the U.S. They're also benefiting from the situation and more, and more people are returning to poker. So at the moment, I don't see any change in that relationship."
89,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,89,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"These are the questions we have time for today, so I'll now hand back to the management team for any final remarks."
90,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,90,Bridie Anne Barrett Schmidt,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Just wanted to thank everyone for the time and the patience over the conference call, and wish you all health, and hope you stay safe. Thank you very much."
91,"888 Holdings plc, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",QA,91,Aviad Kobrine,CFO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Thank you.
