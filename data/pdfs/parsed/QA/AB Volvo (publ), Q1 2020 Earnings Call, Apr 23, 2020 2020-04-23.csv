0,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Hampus Engellau from Handelsbanken.
1,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,1,Hampus Engellau,"Handelsbanken Capital Markets AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Three questions from me. Starting off with this gradual ramp-up, I think what -- if we look at China, there were also a similar gradual ramp-ups. This was, of course, much different, tougher. I understand that. But given from what you're planning now, would it be possible to kind of quantify, in an initial phase, what type of a capacity utilization we could be looking at moving into May and second quarter?"
2,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,2,Hampus Engellau,"Handelsbanken Capital Markets AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Second question is on order intake. Of course, remembering the minus 1,500 order intake that you had in Europe in Q4 2008, that says that lead times are very long. Could you talk a little bit about how lead times are now following the cancellations and trying to -- for us to grasp how to think about further cancellations given lead times?"
3,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,3,Hampus Engellau,"Handelsbanken Capital Markets AB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,And last question for me is more on this announcement with Daimler on fuel cells. You need to put Power Cell. What is the main difference between what you're doing with Daimler in terms of what you had with Power Cell? Is it just a volume game or is there difference in technology?
4,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,4,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Hampus, for those questions. And to start with, China, of course, is a particular case, as you said, as always, when you've had such a big stop, it was also in China, a gradual ramp-up. But China has come back both when it comes to construction equipment and trucks to, as I said, pre-corona levels. For different reasons, we don't expect the same type of rebounds when it comes to Europe and U.S. So when it comes to the first question regarding capacity utilization, it is to be completely transparent too early to really deem how that will look like. But I think you should think about it that when we do the restart now, we primarily restart from low levels to test the supply chain, and then when we feel that, that is working in the different value chains for different business areas and component flows, we will gradually move into adjusting according to the demand levels. Given the short-time layoff programs that we have, we will be very clear on just producing what are firm orders. And that will, as we see it now, have quite a big variation from day to day, but we will install that flexibility given that we have a frozen lead time of a couple of 3 to 4 to -- a little bit depending on the region 3, 4, 5 weeks and adjust that accordingly. But firmly ordered because it is not in the interest of the customers, it's not in the interest of the dealers and ourselves. So we have to take it there step by step. But we will cope with the situation, and we will cope both from, so to speak, a flexibility point of view and from a capacity point of view, thanks to the system that we are installing now."
5,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,5,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"When it comes to the order intake, the same situation that we've had such a dramatic drop, as you did see, of 75% between February and March is, of course, related to the fact that when you're coming to a stop of this magnitude, both new orders are more or less coming to a complete stop because customers are waiting and see to get visibility and what will their demand be after this. And in addition to that, as I said, cancellations of already placed orders and cancellation of some of the stock orders and cleaning out of the order book. So that is continuing. That is the right thing to do. And linked to the first question, then we will gradually now and some orders are coming in, obviously, we will pace them when customers would like to have them produced and take it from there. So this is much more of a short-term game of really finding the balance in this gradual return and gradual ramp-up."
6,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,6,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the final question, I should say that it is important to understand that fuel cells are not commodity. Fuel cells have all different technologies, a lot of different characteristics. And when we have now been evaluating a number of alternatives moving forward into the hydrogen society because we see that after one very viable part of the CO2-neutral society moving forward for long distance and for heavy applications, we have evaluated a number of different alternatives when it comes to technology maturity but also technology characteristics for heavy-duty applications, both when it comes to power outputs and when it comes to durability for our type of applications."
7,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,7,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In addition to that, the opportunity to make an industrialization that makes sense when it comes to shifting this with volumes, that makes sense in order to get the cost level to a level that it can compete with other technologies and also to have a structure that allows others to foresee this shift when investing into infrastructure and hydrogen supply. And when we are -- and then also the opportunity to get to the structure of a 50-50 joint venture producing the fuel cell stack, and thereby, giving a natural way of both sharing development and the whole journey of industrialization, but gaining the opportunity to continue to compete in the market and to continue to have, so to speak, a modular system where the different partners that have the right application and engineering will actually win and be more successful. So that is the very good balance and giving us also the natural influence in this joint venture."
8,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,8,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So coming to the end of your question, for that reason, when we did evaluate different alternatives, this alternative was the outstanding alternative for us, and without any competition, the most viable alternative for Volvo Group moving forward."
9,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,9,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Erik Paulsson from Pareto Securities.
10,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,10,Erik Paulsson,"Pareto Securities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"It's Erik from Pareto. Two questions from my side. First one is on order development here from late March, and you said a negative order intake here. Is it possible to breakdown that into geographic regions from now?"
11,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,11,Erik Paulsson,"Pareto Securities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And also on the second question is regarding this fuel cell JV with Daimler. How much will you invest per year from your side, given that this is approved by the competition authorities?"
12,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,12,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Erik. First and foremost, you can say that the immediate effect that we have seen on the order intake is very similar in all regions where you have the restrictions and the lockdown because you have the same type of reaction from customers and dealers, meaning that there is a restriction, there is a lockdown. We stopped to order and we canceled because we need to create maneuverability, and we the stop phase than 2 different patterns in different geographies. And that we see clearly also obviously that markets that have opened up is gradually also coming back. I mean when we look at China for the different business areas, Japan that has been less in a lockdown, Korea that has also been opening up. So it's, in the current phase, more related to the lockdown. And therefore, as we say, when we are now restarting, we test with the supply first and then gradually moving in to understand what is the right level to follow in the ramp-up when it comes to demand."
13,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,13,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And then when it comes to Daimler and, yes, investments, we have not been precise in that. During the call 2 days ago, it was said that the 2 companies will invest a 9-digit amount of euros into this over the coming period, and we have also said that this is a journey that will be done now during the coming decade here because it will be a very important cornerstone in our strategy up to 2030 and to move into a leading position when it comes to carbon dioxide transportation systems."
14,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,14,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And again, that's the reason why we still -- or not still -- why we find it so attractive to have this joint venture of a modular setup of the fuel cell stack that can be then installed in different type of equipment for heavy-duty applications because you can then share the development costs, keep the consistency, allow other partners to also actually order and to take volumes out of this JV, but more importantly, also other actors to invest in other parts of the system such as infrastructure and hydrogen production. So again, when we are looking into this, and we have already before judged that hydrogen must be a part of our product portfolio, and when we have balanced that in our R&D road map moving forward, this has been the most efficient alternative for us to move forward, both when it comes to a competitive solution in the marketplace but also when it comes to our investments into this technology."
15,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,15,Erik Paulsson,"Pareto Securities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Just this 9-digit amount then, I guess, it's been over 10 to 20 years or so?"
16,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,16,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean, I think the most important is that you should see -- I mean, thanks to setting up a structure like this. It will -- I mean you should think about it also that this is a part of our R&D investments. It's not a separate. I mean, it is the same as we have announced partnerships with Samsung, with NVIDIA, with Isuzu, and it has been growing in different directions because we have a very comprehensive road map in this transformation and to find smart setups depending on what technology and what geography and what type of applications we are talking about is the trick of the tail here. And again, think about it as a part of our R&D investments and an efficient part of our R&D investment, both when it comes to get hold of a mature technology that has been tested in million kilometers for heavy-duty applications with a good IP position and also when it comes to the commercialization and the volume shift because that is also so important when you're talking about the technology shifts."
17,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,17,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Tom Narayan from RBC.
18,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,18,Gautam Narayan,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Tom Narayan, RBC. My questions -- I have a couple. One is on the construction equipment business, where sales were down 17% but margins were still, I think, 13%. I think it was above where consensus expectations were by quite a bit. Could you perhaps comment on what the breakeven level of demand is of that business? Ask another way, what level of volume declines in the CE business would be breakeven on an operating income basis?"
19,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,19,Gautam Narayan,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And also on the Daimler JV, obviously, it's 2 truck makers working together as opposed to you guys working with supplier. Could this perhaps indicate you guys foregoing the supplier route and maybe doing fuel cell kind of by yourselves going in-house? Or just purely just an R&D thing the way that you guys would do on a normal basis?"
20,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,20,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"We see a breakeven point. We don't give any guidance on breakeven point. We can describe the quarter a little. And I think also we should go back to where we were in 2019 because we see it was doing a very good job of taking out costs and not produce too much in -- for the season in Q1, Q2. So they came in, in a pretty well balanced way into this and also starting up very well in Europe and U.S. And we have then the problems from SDLG already in the beginning of the quarter and then coming back to strong volumes for SDLG towards the end of it, whereas the Volvo-branded products, as you have seen them, decreased even more than the SDLG under the circumstances. So I will abstain from giving any guidance on breakeven points, but a strong quarter for VCE, and also it was catered for in a good way in the end of 2019."
21,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,21,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And when it comes to the operation and the joint venture setup regarding the fuel cell, the joint venture is, so to speak, set up in a way where it is both about the continuous development of the fuel cell stack for heavy-duty applications in different forms where we have, so to speak, the ability to use this across the group for different business areas, but it's also set up. So it will be the deployment, industrialization and production of the fuel cell stack. And the fuel cell stack is the component, being the energy layer producing electricity on board for a long distance of our heavy-duty applications than applied to a product. For example, a Volvo Truck with Volvo's electric powertrain, with Volvo's cooling systems, with Volvo chassis and execution. And that is, so to speak, the good balance in this that sharing the development burden on such an important technology and being able to drive the industrialization and the shift and get to volumes quicker where it makes sense. And cost levels can actually compete with other type of -- total cost of operation, other type of drivelines. So the JV will be responsible both for development and for production of the fuel cell stack. And we have also been clear that this is a setup that allows also the joint venture to sell to other parties that could be interesting in this technology."
22,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,22,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Erik Golrang from SEB.
23,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,23,Erik Pettersson-Golrang,"SEB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,I have 3 questions. First one is if you could put a number on -- you said that around 50% of your employees were in some kind of temporary layoff programs currently. Could you put a number on what that means in terms of savings or avoided costs?
24,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,24,Erik Pettersson-Golrang,"SEB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then the second quarter ties into headcount as well. You saw a drop of total headcount by 7% in Q1. Given what you're planning now, where would you expect that number to be for the second quarter?"
25,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,25,Erik Pettersson-Golrang,"SEB, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then finally, on the UD Trucks deal, if you can get a status update there. Should we simply assume that it's still on, but that the price will be lower?"
26,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,26,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Maybe I can start on the first one, the 50,000 employees on short term. First of all, that has to a very, very limited effect impacted Q1 since it happened towards the very end of the quarter. And we don't give any guidance on savings. I mean, Sweden is a big part of that. We have 20,000 employees in Sweden, and you know the -- how this system works. If you at least are in Sweden, you can get some number on it. But it also will, of course, depend on how long we will have this and how long we will fully utilize it not only in Sweden but in other parts of the world as well. So also here, I abstain to giving any numbers."
27,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,27,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Related to the headcount reduction, part of that is, of course, the fact that we had a very quick end of the quarter as it relates to consultants where we were reducing consultants. One can put it like drastically, but quickly at least with a certain magnitude. And of course, those are in those numbers. And it will also be very much depending, as Martin was into, how the restart will look like and when we can actually put on new further activities than we have today where we have very, very low activity level as we go on and as we see how the demand is coming back and in what kind of way it does. So also, I will not give any guidance of how this will look going forward. But where we are today, of course, this is a situation where we are decreasing employees and consultants, not increasing, trying to postpone recruitments, et cetera, where we can and also, of course, use a normal turnover to find solutions that we are taking down costs in general in the company."
28,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,28,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And yes, maybe from my side, really to complement what Jan said, I mean, I think you should think about it also as different measures in the same toolbox because short-time work and layoff programs is one part of mitigations in short and midterm and then reduction of resources then, first and foremost, with priority temporary resources and consultants. But as we've also stated -- but that starts from going through the activity level in the company. We will adjust activities, both on the direct and indirect side in relation to what we will have as a demand level, and then we will utilize the different tools here, both when it comes to reductions but also the short-time work depending on how long we deem this will be. And that visibility will gradually increase during the coming months here."
29,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,29,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On UD Trucks and the strategic alliance with Isuzu, that is still on."
30,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,30,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Olof Cederholm from ABG Sundal Collier.
31,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,31,Olof Cederholm,"ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"It's Olof with ABG. I have a question about maybe not the near, near term, but what you call the new normal. I was just wondering how you -- if there is a way of putting the reasons why you don't think Europe and the U.S. will recover as strongly as China has into words, why will that take a lot longer? And also on the -- on your time line, there is no back to the old normal. So what are your thoughts regarding that? Will the truck market simply be a smaller market for the very long term due to this? And why in that case?"
32,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,32,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Olof. First and foremost, I think that's the reason why we are not leaving any forecast for the market that we are still as you are. And I think everyone is struggling with what -- how will the gradual ramp-up and the new normal look like."
33,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,33,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"First and foremost, of course, they are all different economic systems in different parts of the world. And I think one of the key factors for Europe and North America is that we need to start to see more visibility about the coming phases here, not at least when it comes to people's confidence in the future because a lot of the economic activities, and thereby, the need of upstreams, the need of transportation and maybe a little bit less affected infrastructure, but at least transportation is depending on the visibility for normal people and also for companies to start to take normal decisions again regarding consumptions and travels and different type of activities. And therefore, I mean, that link is even more pronounced as we see it in Europe and in Americas. So our link to the normal economic activities in different phases here will determine, to a big extent, what will the demand level be, also when it comes to new trucks. And we have had a couple of very good years, obviously, and that's the reason why we already said that it was expected with a normal correction, both in Europe and in North America. And thereby also, we will see that there is a rather big fleet that can be utilized. So I think we should think about this as a gradual have the right balance in the company and to protect the right type of investments to come out strong and have the ability to continue the transformation of sustainable transportation."
34,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,34,Olof Cederholm,"ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division",ANALYSTS,All right. And you also talked about structural cost savings. Is there -- do you know when you're able to tell us more about this? Will that be in the coming quarter? Or how do you see that?
35,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,35,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"No. Obviously, we are continuously working with both the short-term mitigation activities and the structural type of activity reductions, but it starts really, I mean, to look into what do we believe in -- from a demand level, and thereby, also adjusting, for example, R&D portfolios, IT development, capital expenditures and things like that. So to make sure that we at any point in this gradual ramp-up and the new normal have the -- will have the right balance."
36,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,36,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"One can add that also that what you see on certain items in the P&L like selling and admin, we were already working with downturn management and taking down costs. And of course, this has done -- been accelerated, but still more on operational activities and using the normal tools in the toolbox so far."
37,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,37,Olof Cederholm,"ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. But the -- these measures, would they also include shutting down production facilities for good and changing around in your production setup, et cetera?"
38,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,38,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think, Olof, we are early into this, obviously now, and we are not excluding any alternative, depending on how this will continue to develop. And that should not be wise to do so in this very particular and extensive crisis situation we are. But it's also a unique crisis. So as we go along here, we need to understand in a step-by-step approach, how this will develop. And that's the reason why we are developing different scenarios, both when it comes to the short-term activities and the long-term more structural measures."
39,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,39,Claes Eliasson,Senior Vice President of Media Relations & Group Communication,EXECUTIVES,"Do we have any more questions, operator?"
40,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,40,Operator,,,Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Klas Bergelind from Citi.
41,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,41,Klas Henrik Bergelind,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Martin and Jan, it's Klas from Citi. I hope you are both keeping well. First, on the service revenues down 2% in trucks and 1% down at group level. What was the end of the quarter rate -- exit rate? Shall we see total services down 20%, similar to the utilization there on Slide 5? And if you could also talk about service volumes end of the quarter by region? I will start there."
42,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,42,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Of course -- I mean, when we take a look on demand here, they were holding up pretty well, all of them."
43,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,43,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"So there was no big drop. So we didn't see the truck utilization that happened towards the very end of the quarter still being reflected in service revenues. Going forward, of course, this slide will start to affect us. And since it's pretty generic, it will, of course, affect the whole group except for what we have been to before China and parts of Asia where we see less of it. And it's pretty generic, one must say, where we are today. Then coming back to restart society, coming back, et cetera, et cetera, let's see, but where we are today, pretty generic."
44,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,44,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And that's the reason also -- I mean, maybe just to add on that. That's the reason why I said that briefly also in my comments during the presentation that when we look at countries with more extensive lockdowns, we see also fleet utilization being more severely hit. I mean, if you have had sectors that are very important for certain countries, such as automotive, for example, completely locked down, you have in that regard, an overshoot of the drop in fleet utilization. And just to give a magnitude, maybe in the more open countries in Europe, we have seen a drop of some 10% in fleet utilization, whereas in countries with more extensive lockdown and longer lockdown also, and currently, you have seen fleet utilization drops of 30%, 35%. So again, in order to judge that level moving forward, we need to see how the opening up plans offer different countries as well."
45,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,45,Klas Henrik Bergelind,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. My second one is on -- is also on margin on Slide 5 and thinking about orders. Coming back to the question asked by Hampus. Considering that Asia probably looks better and you also talked about cancellation, that would suggest that orders could be negative now in Europe. I mean, we don't have a financial crisis as of yet, and I think others in the industry have said that orders haven't turned negative yet. But I was just wondering, Martin, if you could say anything, if we are in a situation where we have no demand and then cancellations on top?"
46,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,46,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I should say, I mean, we have a small demand coming in from, but very tiny. But when you take the net effect of this, which is natural, and I think that is in a way good that we have those relations with both customers and dealers that we can have a conversation about what is the right type of products to still have in the order board. We have seen in days and weeks that the orders are around 0, and that is the net effect, obviously. But again, in a stop phase like this, you should see that also as, I think, a right methodology to do to really make sure that we have the close conversation because we don't have any interest to push forward a firm order book that dealers or customers have to take and then ending up with a problem down the road of a built-up unit, so to speak. So now when we are in the stop phase, it's still getting a little bit theoretical about that. I think more you should see it about really getting visibility of the firm orders remaining in the order board."
47,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,47,Klas Henrik Bergelind,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Makes sense. My final and -- the third and final is on deliveries and thinking about it sort of in the same way. I mean, you didn't put it on Slide 5, and that's fine. But one effect compared to the financial crisis is obviously that deliveries could fall more than what the backlog suggests because most economies are close to business, something we heard from Epiroc and other industrial overnight. Can we get any indication how much deliveries in trucks were down there in March and April perhaps because those falls might have been quite big as well?"
48,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,48,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Well, since -- I mean, this is not to a big extent related to production since the things that we were selling forth. But -- so it's more of how the customers can get the vehicles because from time-to-time they are not able to it because there is a closed society, and it's not possible to move. Some cases, of course, the dealers doesn't have sort of the need for it right now, so would like to defer to take out the vehicles a little as well, but that's not affecting so much on deliveries. We will see more of that when we come into the period we are right now, and I think, also, depending on what will happen in the demand in general, as Martin went into, also in May. Let's see. But of course, we have not seen the full effect of this yet, as I see it."
49,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,49,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And it has even been difficult to do registrations, et cetera, because authorities have been closed also. So there has been so many parts of these lockdowns and restrictions affecting quite a number of steps in this delivery chain. And again, now we need to assess what is what in this, basically."
50,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,50,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Agnieszka Vilela from Nordea.
51,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,51,Agnieszka Vilela,"Nordea Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Two questions from me. The first one is, if you could quantify your exposure to the energy sector and when it comes to trucks and construction equipment? That would be helpful."
52,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,52,Agnieszka Vilela,"Nordea Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then the second one, if you could elaborate about your planning for the construction equipment market. How do you think about how the demand will shape up now, given where we are in the cycle and inventory levels, usage of the machine and stimulus packages coming in? And if you could give the color for the different regions?"
53,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,53,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"First and foremost, if you start with the energy sector, and a question we get there, obviously, of the news around market that have a lot of vocational type of applications, and they are in relative terms, so to speak, into the energy sector, for example, in North America. But still it represents 4%, 5% of their revenues. So that is one example of that. And for other truck brands, it is smaller. It's not even visible to that extent."
54,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,54,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Construction equipment. Yes, we have some exposure, but also rather limited in relation to other industrial verticals. Then when it comes to construction equipment, in general, obviously, what we have seen now is, as I said, also that in Asia, Korea and China, it has picked up well. We will see how continuous, so to speak, stimulus when it comes to infrastructure and other type of activities will continue to pull that demand forward in those regions. And as I said, also we have seen for other major regions that construction equipment is following trucks but with a lag. And then obviously, it depends, to your point, on how different countries and regions will act when it comes to stimulus packages. It's too early to say. But as Jan was into, I think, and we have shown also with the leverage here for construction equipment, we have a good flexibility into that system, and we are keeping good balance also when it comes to the stock levels. And that was the reason also why we did less of preproduction, for example, for this spring season for construction equipment."
55,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,55,Claes Eliasson,Senior Vice President of Media Relations & Group Communication,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you. Do we have one more? And then we will, perhaps, call it today."
56,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,56,Operator,,,Our final question is from Daniela Costa from Goldman Sachs.
57,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,57,Daniela C. R. de Carvalho e Costa,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Can you hear me?
58,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,58,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,Yes.
59,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,59,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,Yes.
60,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,60,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,Yes.
61,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,61,Daniela C. R. de Carvalho e Costa,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Three quick questions. First one, and apologies if you've answered earlier, I didn't hear it, but the line was sometimes patchy. Level of inventories across the various regions, particularly in the U.S. for the market, can you comment on where that stands now? I think in the past, you've given for the U.S. helpful figures there."
62,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,62,Daniela C. R. de Carvalho e Costa,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Number two, on the buses side, can you comment on there, as why -- any quick fixes that you could do on the margins there? I guess, looking at what you did in trucks, the margins are still pretty resilient, but could you turn around buses, anything there?"
63,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,63,Daniela C. R. de Carvalho e Costa,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And number three, I just wanted to clarify on the investment on the fuel cells along with Daimler on those 9-figure -- 9-digit figure that you've mentioned. Is that over and above your prior commentary on the outlook for CapEx or was -- or is there stuff that you were doing internally and sort of is just reallocated towards the JV? How shall we think about CapEx over the medium term?"
64,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,64,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Well, starting with the inventories -- and I mean, we were in a downturn phase, and we were addressing this also, and we had a Q4 presentation, and I stated there that we have more to do there. And of course, in this situation, we have more to do definitely on our inventories. And of course, that is -- goes very much to our retail system in U.S. They also had too much on their hands coming into this quarter, and now in this situation, there is still a need to take that down, of course."
65,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,65,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"Moving over to buses, it's not a quick fix. If it would have been a quick fix, I think it would have happened. But yes, we will -- I won't say turnaround because they are on a positive track there, so -- but continue that journey with measures that we have already installed to many -- to a big extent and do the continuous improvement work, actually. And then we had investments of fuel cells, which I think we have been in for -- to before, but..."
66,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,66,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And again, as we said, I think you should think about this as a setup and structure that allows us to contain this in the R&D portfolio in a smart way when it comes both to CapEx and when it comes to development -- investments or development spendings to get hold of this very important part of our future portfolio. So from that reason, think about it as part of the R&D road map moving forward, and obviously, we're looking through that now what is the right level for R&D investments. But as I clearly stated, when coming to protect our core R&D and the transformation activities to make sure that Volvo is competitive also for the coming decade where a lot of transformation will happen, this will continuously that we should have been doing if we should have been doing it alone."
67,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,67,Jan Ytterberg,"Executive VP of Group Finance, CFO & Member of the Group Executive Board",EXECUTIVES,"I want to remark on buses which I think we should remember, coaches represent a big share of their size, and of course, coaches with reduced tourists, and then so forth, going forward, it has been affected already in the beginning of this quarter. So buses have been more affected than maybe others in that respect."
68,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,68,Claes Eliasson,Senior Vice President of Media Relations & Group Communication,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, all of you on the line and also to you gentlemen here in the room. This concludes the presentation for the first quarter 2020. Looking forward to be meeting you again in a quarter. Thank you."
69,"AB Volvo (publ), Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2020",QA,69,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, very much."
