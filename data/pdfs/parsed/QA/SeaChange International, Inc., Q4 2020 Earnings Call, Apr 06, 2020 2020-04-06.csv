0,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Frankel with Dougherty.
1,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,1,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So Yossi, you talked about several deals that you hoped to close in Q4 that slipped out. I wonder if you might tell us approximately how many deals slipped out of the quarter? What was their value? And have any of those deals closed thus far in Q1?"
2,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,2,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Steve. So these are 4 deals from the international market. We did not lose any of them. We expect to close all of them. Closing the 4 deals would have enabled us to significantly exceed our revenue target. Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the agreement in a timely manner. It's also important to note, if you don't mind, that our win ratio, including these 4 deals that we consider not out of the win ratio, our win ratio for last year was quite decent. It was over 75%, out of which 4 deals were pushed out. We did not lose them, and we are also starting with a positive momentum. So overall, we are still very bullish on the future of our company."
3,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,3,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And let's talk about solving the cash problem. Yes, you did generate some cash in Q4, but it was a relatively minor amount. I assume your internal plan was for something higher than that. What kind of cash burn might we expect in the next couple of quarters until business picks up?"
4,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,4,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, it's Mike. I can take that. So during the first 3 quarters of the year, we did burn $17 million. We had kind of a, call it, cash neutral or we generated a little bit of cash in Q4. Granted, it was a small increase, but I think it was significant in comparison to the cash burn in prior quarters and prior years. 2020 was a transition year for us. So we're focused on optimizing our cost structure, building a business that's consistently generating cash. And then I think just in terms of stability, we've got an accounts receivable and an unbilled base. And if we ever, at some point in the future, decided we wanted to put something in place, I think that would be kind of a logical next step."
5,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,5,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"But you will burn material cash in the next couple of quarters, right? That's just your business cycle that's been the company's history? Or is there something different that says if business recovers in Q2, you'd generate cash?"
6,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,6,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Mike, before you answer that, Steve, there's one more item that you need to look at. You will see the updated OpEx. The challenge we had last year, we had some negative commitments, very meaningful in terms of OpEx. The impact of these legacy commitments was both on the support organization and the R&D organization. Now that all of these legacy commitments are done and completed with negative ROI, obviously, in Q1, our cost structure is much better, therefore, it will have a significant impact on the cash that we need. But Mike, please go ahead."
7,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,7,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"No, I think that makes sense. I think the only thing I'll just add is, yes, we may see a little bit of a cash burn, especially maybe quarter-to-quarter. We'll give maybe some longer-term outlook when we give additional guidance. But I think like I mentioned, the -- compared to kind of legacy SeaChange, we don't expect that type of significant burn in 2021."
8,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,8,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And just a follow-up on a press release you had, maybe it was last week, where you talked about the increase in streaming, and I understand that's obviously what's going on in the market. But is there any component of Framework today where you derive incremental revenue as customer activity increases?"
9,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,9,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"It's limited to new components. For instance, when customer activity is increasing, many of our Framework customers, obviously, they will require some more cloud services, where we have decent gross margin, and some of them will require better analytics as well. This will be positive. Also and this is fairly new in places where we are going to take over the advertisement, obviously, over there, there will be meaningful increase."
10,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,10,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. So these are things that potentially can come into play in the -- over the next year. Where is the head count today? And given the COVID-19 situation, are you contemplating further shrinking head count?"
11,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,11,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So right now, we're at about 275 globally. We have made some changes. And I think we just are going to continue to evaluate it on a kind of a monthly and a quarterly basis. I feel like we made a lot of changes at the end of our fiscal '20, in Q3 and Q4. And so we kind of feel like we are lean and efficient and can leverage that, and we'll continue to monitor that going forward."
12,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,12,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then a big-picture question. If you've done 26 Framework deals, remind us how large your customers could you convert?"
13,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,13,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So the legacy installed base, it's about 120 customers. It's important to note that many, many, many of the Framework wins are from new customers and new functionality. If you are looking at our target market, so obviously we are not only servicing the legacy customers that SeaChange used to service. It's not only a cable solution. The vast majority of the Framework customers are OTT solution. Now when you think about the OTT domain, so -- of course, cable providers are there, and we will continue to service them and do our best to support them, but we also have content providers and content owners. And if you think about content owners, for instance, I'm not suggesting that Bloomberg is a customer but Bloomberg is a content owner, and Bloomberg, and this is public information, Bloomberg is starting an over-the-top direct-to-consumer service. This is not to be confused with the Bloomberg channel. So this is another type of content provider."
14,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,14,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So if you think about it, the target customers that we are facing, especially these days, so it's a growing TAM and it's a significantly growing TAM. So in this sense, there's a very meaningful opportunity to do much more. And just look at the pipeline that we have going into Q1, and pipeline means that there is an opportunity, there is budget, and we are the front-runner, that's what we call a pipeline. It's the best pipeline we have ever had, hundreds of millions. So are we going to close it all this year? No. But we don't give an estimate to meet 50% of our win ratio for this year to meet our target for the year. So we feel confident. Is the next few months or next few weeks are going to be challenging? Maybe, we continue to engage. We'll see. Is this year going to be great? Yes."
15,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,15,Steven Bruce Frankel,"Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. And then maybe you hinted at some OpEx expense savings in Q1. Maybe give us an idea of what kind of year-over-year decline in OpEx we might see in Q1?
16,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,16,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So our non-GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 million for Q4. And I think we're generally going to be around that run rate for the next couple of quarters or for fiscal '21. And that's obviously significantly better than in prior quarters, prior years."
17,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,17,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street.
18,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,18,Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Fully recognizing sort of the COVID-19 situation makes it a bit difficult. Just curious if you could comment on your confidence that customer spending is more being pushed and not being reduced at this time.
19,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,19,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Jaeson, thanks for the question. Some customers are going to push their budget, absolutely. But look at the bright side. Almost each and every TV provider on the climate, this is just like 2008, they will have to optimize their OpEx. Who else is going to offer them a solution that will enable them to reduce their OpEx by up to 50%. There's no one. Look at all the other vendors, there are not too many of them, but the other vendors that are selling multiple components for video delivery platform. They have a very long and complex price list, which has nothing to do with the operator needs and the operator OpEx challenges. And we are there. We have value-based engagement, it's unique."
20,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,20,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So are we going to see some customers that are going to delay their budget? Yes, sure. Are we going to going to see more of those. I think it's fair to say that we already see some of those or many of those."
21,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,21,Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's helpful. And I know you mentioned a pretty impressive win rate. But just curious, what tends to be the primary pushback from customers today with not going with the Framework deal?"
22,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,22,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So we reported 26 wins. And I said that our win rate was over 75%, also may be slightly more than that. So we lost very, very few opportunities. In the 25% that we did not win, I'm also including 4 deals that were pushed to this year. So we lost very, very few opportunities. It's hard to say. We lost so few, so -- and each one has its own reason for losing it. And losing is not only to another vendor, in some cases, losing, it means that we initiated engagement, and we were not able to convince the customer to close the engagement within the year."
23,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,23,Jaeson Allen Min Schmidt,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,And then just a quick question on the Framework plug-in store. Is this really targeted at a different segment of the market? Or is this viewed more as additive for a customer that already has gone with a more kind of broad-based Framework deal?
24,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,24,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So if you think about the Framework, the best analogy probably is a phone. So SeaChange used to have all these gauge components like a CPU, a power button, a volume button, we took all these components, and now we are selling the best-in-class phone. Each and everyone that has this phone will have access to the App Store, to the plug-ins. But this is something that is going to be meaningful to each and every Framework customer. And within 9 months, we were able to win 26 customers, deliver the vast majority, to vast fast majority of them. I think we should be able to win a more meaningful number this year. And then once this decent number of Framework customers will have access to the Framework app store, the plug-ins, if you will, we will see some revenue contribution over there as well."
25,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,25,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from George Marema with Pareto Ventures.
26,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,26,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,So on the -- can you illuminate a little bit on the 120 legacy installed base? What sort of revenue opportunities in fiscal 2021 does that represent to us?
27,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,27,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So we can convert some of this installed base into Framework. So the 120, these are customers that are using a SeaChange component. They are not using the Framework. The vast majority of them are using one single component, with many other components from several vendors. In terms of value, probably the average value of this -- of the current installed base, the average Framework value is about $2 million to $4 million. Obviously, these are the vast majority of them, these are cable providers. So the pace over there is slightly slower. But with the COVID-19 impact on the market and the cable segment, we should be able to be in a position where maybe in the second half of the year, we are going to be able to convert many of them to the Framework."
28,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,28,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"If you think about cable providers, similar to 2008 or even worse, in fact, since they have to make investments in the networks, even the smallest operators, to continue and support the growing demand down. We already see this report, video ARPU is going down. So we have our back office install that to many cable providers. So we see this as also what they share with us. And you will see that in a public manner, probably in a month or so when they will publish their reports. So their OpEx is increasing, their revenues are decreasing, we should be able to accelerate the conversion of some of the installed base into Framework."
29,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,29,George Marema,,ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then you -- is it true that, although maybe some people are sort of freezing their budget for the moment, for the next few weeks, to see what happens? Aren't some people in video accelerating their plans due to the necessity to go online immediately due to the -- like movie theaters and other content providers need to rush to market? Are you seeing some -- on the other side of the table, increased engagement from certain parties?"
30,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,30,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Oh, yes. Sure. Absolutely. You see more demand from content owners. Some content owners, like the one you mentioned, obviously, they are looking to move very, very quick. And the fact that we have a solution, running on AWS, obviously enable us to go to production fairly quickly. For instance, there's a customer in the Nordics that we were able to take the production with hundreds of thousands of subscribers within very, very few months. So we see more demand. And I believe that we have the right solution to support this demand."
31,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,31,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Are you noticing any trends among regions like is Europe stronger or weaker, North America stronger or weaker, Latin America stronger, weaker in Q1 here right now? Any geography trends?"
32,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,32,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So we have -- in terms of opportunity size, I think it's fair to say that what we have today going into Q1, and obviously this is a pipeline that we built last year, the deals that we see today are significantly, significantly higher than everything that we have managed to close last year. And obviously, the larger deals require a longer engagement cycle, but now we are getting there."
33,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,33,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"In terms of new demand, most of the new demand is in the Americas where some content providers, content owners are faster to react. Europe, overall, is a more conservative market, so it's moving slightly slower over there in terms of new demand, not current demand."
34,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,34,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now if you think about the Framework, it's been out only for less than 9 months. So we started to offer the Framework for less than 9 months for last year. We started to offer the Framework, we introduced the Framework at NAB of last year, this was in April. And then we started to deliver within 60 days or so after the introduction of the Framework. So overall, the success is quite good. And the fact that we have this great, this amazing pipeline, it's because of 2 reasons, because of the fact that we have the right technology and obviously customers acknowledge that, and also the value-based engagement, which enable us, especially during this -- these days, to take new content providers in a way that will enable them to launch a service with cost control and current TV providers in a way that will enable them to control their OpEx."
35,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,35,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,Okay. And are you guys still expecting somewhere in the ballpark of a similar service revenue per quarter the next couple of quarters for the 2021?
36,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,36,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So we will... sorry, go ahead, Mike."
37,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,37,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So obviously, the service revenue was a big piece of legacy SeaChange. We will definitely see a decline in that in the next couple of quarters. So service revenue for Q4 was $6 million. We still have probably maybe $5 million to $10 million in total of legacy revenue to transition through the year, but you will see a decline in the services, and then that will be offset with an increase in product revenue, which is primarily what the Framework revenue is."
38,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,38,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"And when you sell a Framework deal, is there any service component that gets bled through with all components?"
39,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,39,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. There is and so -- no, there is a component. So roughly, it's maybe, say, 2/3, 1/3. So if it's a $3 million deal, it's generally 2 pieces. It's $2 million of a software license and then the remaining $1 million is a services and support agreement, and that's generally over the term of the contracts, which are generally 4 to 5 years. So that other $1 million would come in ratably. And so -- and you can see this in our tables in the press release. We are starting to build up a piece of the Framework that is recurring. But obviously, given that mix, 2/3, 1/3, with 1/3 being spread over the life, you're seeing that build but it's at a smaller scale right now."
40,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,40,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"And on the Framework, is it earned monthly, quarterly or annually payments? How is the cash flow, those revenues in the out years?"
41,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,41,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"So the model, typically, there's revenue recognition and there's cash. So revenue, I think we went through the 2 pieces, right, with a license when we deliver it and then ratable. Generally, the first kind of 26 deals or so that we sold with the new go-to-market, we've been spreading the payment terms out ratably. So in that same $3 million deal, where we just walk through where our revenue comes in, from a billing perspective, that will be ratable over the 4 to 5 years."
42,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,42,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,And you bill once a year or once a quarter or once a what?
43,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,43,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Sorry. They're generally once a year or once a quarter. The most part, I'd say, majority is annually. Yes. So there'd be 1/5 kind of when they sign a contract and then..."
44,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,44,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"So on a $5 million deal over 5 years, you get $1 million year 1; $1 million year 2, all of this. So if you've build it April 1 of 2019, it'd be $1 million April 1, 2019; $1 million April 1, 2020; $1 million April 1, 2021. Is that how they go?"
45,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,45,Michael D. Prinn,"CFO, Senior VP & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Correct, yes."
46,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,46,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Yossi Aloni for closing remarks. Thank you.
47,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,47,Yosef Aloni,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, everyone, for joining us today for the SeaChange fourth quarter fiscal 2020 conference. You may now disconnect."
48,"SeaChange International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,48,Operator,,,Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening.
