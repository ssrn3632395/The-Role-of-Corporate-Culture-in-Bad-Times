1,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,1,Operator,,,Our first question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson.
2,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,2,Peter James Heckmann,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"What -- in terms of the revenue conversion rate issue you talked about that popped up in the fourth quarter, can you give us a little bit more background on that? And anything that may have changed in terms of mix and how that -- what that implies for the next couple of quarters?"
3,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,3,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Pete, thank you for the question. So that revenue conversion rate that I quoted was specifically plasma. And we saw a significantly lower revenue conversion rate for the new centers we brought on in the September 30, all of those turned up at the same time. We did see the loads that we were expecting, in fact, Q4 loads were up a little more than 20% versus the plasma Q3 loads. But the conversion rate on those, due to the behavior of those particular customers and where they were located, led to less interchange revenue and cardholder transaction fee revenue. We have not been able to evaluate that just yet, since we're in our closing procedures for first quarter, to see how that may have changed. We expect that to improve as those performances -- and we did actually make some changes with our partners in banking in Mexico that should help with our overall gross margins on those centers, putting in place a bilateral agreement to improve the cost of ATM transactions that will help with the gross margin on those. But beyond that, I can't look too closely just yet at the revenue conversion rate for Q1."
4,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,4,Peter James Heckmann,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up question. In terms of investment spend, I'm sure it's a little bit hard to quantify, but can you talk about some of the investment spend that you had in 2019 on things like PaySign Premier, corporate loyalty, generally, items that didn't generate much revenue. And then, how you're thinking about that number for 2020?"
5,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,5,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So I think that our CEO had touched on new hires and the build-out of patient affordability. You also see, as you look at the cash flow statement, you can see our investments in capital expenditure is about $3.2 billion, $3.3 million. So there were investments last year. It was a little higher than I anticipated early in the year of about $2.25 million to $2.5 million. Just to give you a little more insight, as we look to 2020, we've modeled in CapEx of $3.2 million to $3.7 million."
6,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,6,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Austin Moldow with Canaccord Genuity.
7,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,7,Austin William Moldow,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Of the 7 pharma contracts in 2019, how many are those still active or renewed in 2020? And how many new contracts have been signed for the remainder of 2020? And what does the pipeline look like for pharma for the rest of this year? And if there is any impact from the virus?"
8,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,8,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So with respect to pharma, just to give you a little bit of history, we ended 2018 with 3 programs. We added 7 programs in 2019, taking us to 10. We had 2 programs that ended. So we ended the year 2019 with 8 programs. And in quarter 1, we've added 2 additional programs."
9,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,9,Austin William Moldow,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, got it. And can you also repeat the Q1 pharma load growth numbers you mentioned, and what those growth rates exactly related to? And how you expect -- or I'd like to understand better what you expect the cadence of pharma to be through the year?"
10,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,10,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So I'm just stepping back up to my notes. I'm looking back on my comments. The pharma loads for Q1 versus Q1 2019 increased 70%. The loads increased roughly 275% versus the fourth quarter. And this is one of the things that we've continued to reiterate with analysts and those that follow us as they ask business. As we've talked about before, the pharma business tends to be seasonal since the out-of-pocket for consumers is greatest in the first quarter prior to having met their deductibles. And at that point, you see the pharmaceutical manufacturers and our payment solution standing in and providing that assistance, that co-pay assistance, if you will."
11,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,11,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So as I mentioned, the cash balance in February is $61 million. That tends to be a seasonal peak. Last year, it hit a seasonal peak in March. This year, it appears to be, at least for our current customers, hitting that in February. As we look forward, we do have a couple of additional clients that we just onboarded. Those will contribute to this year. And we have several new pharma clients in the pipeline, actually, in contracting, as we speak. So we're expecting some additional wins on the pharma business and that the combination of onboarding new clients along with the slow degradation on seasonality of existing pharma business should net-net lead to strong growth on a full-year basis for pharma. We saw an increase to $7 million and roughly 21% of our business was pharma in 2019. We do expect a solid growth this year. And to give you a little bit of a flavor, let me just drop back down and look at a couple of things that I thought I would share if the questions arose. We are expecting the full year mix to be approximately 65% plasma, 25% to 30% pharma and roughly 5% to 10% other business."
12,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,12,Austin William Moldow,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. And sorry, one last one, if I could sneak it in. Do you expect the pharma revenue conversion rate to stay roughly the same in 2020?"
13,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,13,Austin William Moldow,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Don't -- I mean it's hard to predict. It's based on the performance of those programs and exactly how each new program comes on board relative to the current programs. But there's nothing at the moment that indicates that it would change, but I hedge a little bit, up or down, frankly."
14,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,14,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions]
15,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,15,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Jon Hickman with Ladenburg Thalmann.
16,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,16,Jon Robert Hickman,"Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So my question has to do with, could you give us some idea with -- about the cost of the SOX 404(b) in your audit since it was pretty extensive. I take it that won't repeat itself in Q2, but could you give us some idea of what that cost you in Q1?"
17,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,17,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So as you can probably imagine, we had to engage our auditors early last year on a regular financial audit. In the middle of the year, after we tripped the higher market cap and became accelerated filer, we signed an additional engagement where they would conduct the 404(b) assessment. If I'm not mistaken, that was somewhere around $70,000 incurred in 2019. And given the extended period of time that we encountered with our auditors in 2020, they upped that by, I believe, about an additional $50,000 in the first quarter."
18,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,18,Jon Robert Hickman,"Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,And then the consulting?
19,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,19,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"The third-party advisory firm was $61,500. And that was incurred in 2019. So we've tried to limit that expense and -- go ahead."
20,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,20,Jon Robert Hickman,"Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Sounds like you did a pretty good job. So the other questions I had have been asked and answered.
21,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,21,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson.
22,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,22,Peter James Heckmann,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Gentlemen, I just wanted to clarify. You went through a lot of information fairly quickly. But -- so at the end of the first quarter, it sounds as if you had 10. In pharmaceutical payment assistance you had approximately, let's see, 7, 10 -- yes, really 10 at the end of the first quarter, 2 ended in the fourth quarter, 2 were added in the first quarter. Number one, is that correct? And then number two, the pharma value loaded in the first quarter, that up 70% number, that reflects the turn of cash. You kind of gave us the walk, but -- from December to March, but that $55 million at the end of March would represent somewhere around $45 million, $46 million in restricted cash. Was that all correct?"
23,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,23,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So we ended with $10 million on roughly -- excuse me, we ended with 10 clients, you're right. And that -- the 2 that were added in the first quarter have generated very little activity to date. So those are not really reflected in our first quarter results. And yes, roughly $9.4 million to $9.5 million is unrestricted cash. So the balance is restricted on that $54 million, $55 million you quoted, correct."
24,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,24,Peter James Heckmann,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, great. And then just in terms of the PaySign Premier, it sounds like you directed some marketing dollars to some other initiatives. In terms of how we see that business rolling out this year, do you feel like there may be opportunities there to grow the business through other affiliates or partners? Or just in terms of near-term returns, you just -- you see relatively more potential on the pharma side?"
25,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,25,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"So as Mark stated, we are marketing it to existing customers in partnership with one of our larger clients. We are continuing to test it, how to best and most economically drive customer conversions before expanding further. However, our focus has been on the kind of the larger opportunities in front of us. But we will continue to work on Premier Card also."
26,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,26,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Austin Moldow with Canaccord Genuity.
27,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,27,Austin William Moldow,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just 2 more, please. Though other revenues are still small, just 1% 2019 total revenue, can you talk about what card programs are in that? Is it just the DDA cards, which means that revenue is concentrated in Q4? Or are there other loyalty and incentive programs in that, too?"
28,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,28,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,Yes. It's a combination of card programs. It's not any single program.
29,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,29,Austin William Moldow,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. And can you talk about how those programs in other revenue -- do they have the same -- is there the same dynamic where there are loaded funds at the top and you take the revenue and there's a revenue conversion on that? And is there any color about what kind of -- if what kind of loaded funds are associated with those small programs?
30,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,30,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So yes, it's a bit of a hybrid. Part of it is transaction processing that we're doing on the card programs. Part of it has dollars loaded to card and a traditional kind of revenue conversion rate, as you've looked at our other programs."
31,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,31,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And last question. If you did see headwinds to the top line from the virus, is there any flexibility there with expense reductions? Or have you tested the model in a sort of worst-case scenario?"
32,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,32,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, absolutely. So definitely have done some sensitivity analysis. One of the questions that we anticipated was around cash burn and cash flows. And in all of our scenarios that we've looked at, we do anticipate being cash flow positive. However, that said, we will look closely at the paycheck loan process available through the SBA that the government's announced, since employers with less than 500 employees can have access to those funds as a contingency. We're also looking at other levers as considerations as well, although we, again, expect continued positive cash flow."
33,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,33,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks.
34,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,34,Mark Kenneth Attinger,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So look, it's a difficult time for our country right now and for the world, and we're all digesting what's occurring, and how to protect our families and loved ones and those who we work with. With that said, please make no mistake about it, we remain as focused as ever on executing each day and each week in delivering valuable services to our clients and customers and continuing our growth and profitability. Thank you, again, for your interest, for your questions and your participation in this call. And be safe and have a good evening. And Mark, do you want to add to that?"
35,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,35,Mark R. Newcomer,"Co-Founder, Vice-Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Again, thank you, Diego, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to staying in touch in future quarters. Have a nice day and you all take care and stay safe out there."
36,"PaySign, Inc., 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,36,Operator,,,Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect.
