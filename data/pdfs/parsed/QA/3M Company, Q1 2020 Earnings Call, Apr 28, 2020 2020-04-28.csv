0,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
1,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,1,,,,It's great to see 3M finally doing what 3M always does. Congratulations.
2,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,2,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Thank you.
3,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,3,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Just first question, just a big picture question. In terms of your capacity additions in nonwovens and, specifically, respirators, how do you think the industry will change because you're not the only ones adding capacity? Lots of capacity added in China. All of a sudden, you have Honeywell showing up in North America and Europe. What does it mean for competitive environment 2 years out?"
4,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,4,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Andrew, it's a little hard to look 2 years out. But certainly, as we think about capacity expansion that we're doing today, a big part of that is in that category of surge capacity for situations like we're facing with COVID-19, there is going to be, we think, a significant tail to demand in this. You can look out. There's demand from governments, from health care and there's also ongoing demand in the industry as industry comes back from economic slowdown. So we're mapping all of that into our capacity and then we're working with governments and the Department of Defense in the U.S. to plan for capacity that would be dedicated to their needs in a COVID-like crisis. So it's -- I think it's really lined up well with what we see as ongoing market and industry demand. And we're looking, obviously, broader than just our capacity. We're looking at the marketplace and the capabilities. And it's -- and we're focusing here on N95 and really respiratory solutions that meet those requirements."
5,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,5,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"So I think it's got a view as far as we can see it. As we look out further beyond, you said a couple of years out, it's going to depend on where we end up in those big end markets, health care and industrial."
6,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,6,Andrew Burris Obin,,,"And just on an unrelated topic, I think there were some news items. I think Bloomberg reported some sort of developments in the hearing protection lawsuits. Can you just -- and it's interesting, I guess, the message is on pricing and disclosure. And I guess, in light that you guys actually published list for N95. But can you just comment where you are in terms of this hearing protection lawsuit? And any comment sort of on the Bloomberg article?"
7,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,7,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me start here. 3M has great respect for the brave men and women who protect us around the world. And we have a long history of partnering with the U.S. military, and we continue to be committed to making safe products. We've worked in close coordination with them, and 3M did not withhold information from the government about fit and use of this product. The narrative out there is misleading and really lacks context. So I think it's -- we will defend ourselves and we deny that our product was defectively designed. So I would just say that, that narrative is very misleading."
8,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,8,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
9,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,9,Deane Michael Dray,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I'd also like to add my appreciation for all the 3M has done to help health care workers globally. And in my view, that's exactly the kind of corporate citizen we'd expect 3M to respond. And so congratulations to everybody."
10,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,10,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Thanks, Deane."
11,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,11,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Thank you.
12,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,12,Deane Michael Dray,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A number of companies have, in lieu of -- considering suspending guidance, they've been offering some scenario analysis or sensitivity in terms of how the year could play out in terms of decrementals, margins. Can you take a stab at that? And how might this all compare to the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, if we use that as kind of a benchmark? Could we start there, please?"
13,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,13,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Deane, I'll take that one. First of all, of course, we like, I think, any other company, we're going through a number of scenarios. And while I don't plan to share the different scenarios because this is a dynamic situation, a couple of things I will share. First of all, we, as Mike noted, as we go through this quarter and until we see a reason to change that, we're going to be providing monthly revenue to give you the insight of what's going on with our businesses in different geographies. In addition, you heard Mike talk about the cost-saving actions that we are -- that we've implemented for Q2. And inclusive of that, we expect in the second quarter that we will be seeing decremental margins between 30% and 40%. And now that's inclusive of the $350 million to $400 million of cost saving actions. So between sharing the revenue each month as we see it and this -- and our view on decremental margins, we think that gives you some insight as to what you can be expecting from us from an earnings perspective as we're going forward."
14,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,14,Deane Michael Dray,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That's a helpful start. And then could you also clarify, since this is -- and we appreciate getting the monthly revenue updates. You just suggested we could be getting it by geography. Will you also be sharing -- will it be organic and also by segment?"
15,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,15,Deane Michael Dray,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"We think organic is the best way to share this, and that's our plan right now. And we do plan to be providing insights of what's going on by both business and geography."
16,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,16,Deane Michael Dray,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's going to be really helpful, so I appreciate it. Just last question. It got cited, but not clarified. What were the asset write-downs that were COVID-related? You sized it, but what were the businesses and why?"
17,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,17,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Those are -- within our company, we have what we call new ventures where we're investing venture capital in a number of places of emerging technologies that we think will complement the 3M business model. These were some mark-to-market actions. All or virtually all were felt within the core miscellaneous aspect of our company."
18,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,18,Deane Michael Dray,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,But why were those COVID-related?
19,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,19,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,As a result of changes in triggering events in terms of the value of those companies that we saw that as COVID-related.
20,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,20,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
21,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,21,Charles Stephen Tusa,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Sorry, if I missed this, busy earnings morning, but the $350 million to $450 million in costs in the second quarter, that's a pretty big number. Does that -- is there kind of carryforward into the -- sorry, in the second quarter? Does that carry forward in like the third and the fourth? And how much of that is temporary? How much of that was from last year's restructuring? Just unclear to me what's included there. Sorry if I missed you detailing it earlier in the call. I'm sure you did. But I missed -- I might have missed that."
22,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,22,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Steve, I'll go through a few of those details. First of all, it is taking actions on a number of components of cost structure. The first and the biggest component is things what we internal to 3M called indirect costs, things that are not payroll or raw material cost related. So travel, external services, temporary workers, targeted ad merch, things like that, we are working on bringing that spending down in line with what we're seeing happen in the external market."
23,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,23,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We've also frozen any new hiring. And in the case of with employees, there are some parts of the world where we have put employees on required mandatory use of vacation. So those are the things that are driving that."
24,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,24,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In terms of carry forward into future quarters, I'd say, Steve, it's just volatile now that -- and flexible that some of it or much of it may carry forward, depending on what we see, but not necessarily depending on the type of recovery that 3M sees in the coming quarters."
25,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,25,Charles Stephen Tusa,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. So you seem to kind of have yet to take structural action -- incremental structural action beyond what you guys did last year, which is what most companies are doing, just by the way."
26,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,26,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"That is correct, Steve."
27,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,27,Charles Stephen Tusa,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then one last one just on how you're approaching this environment. The inventories, a lot of companies are keeping a little bit of a buffer stock. Have you guys maintained that buffer stock? Or have you continued to work down inventories from where they were last year?"
28,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,28,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Steve, one of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks was how our enterprise operations, bringing together manufacturing, supply chain and customer operations together into one organization that we launched at the beginning of the year. It's really been benefiting us, and this is another area where, really, we continue to take down days of inventory outstanding. So we do have plans to reduce inventory, some of it in response to slower demand, some of it really taking advantage of that improved performance. So we have targeted significant inventory reductions on both of those drivers."
29,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,29,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
30,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,30,Nigel Edward Coe,,,"By the way, great idea. Great idea on the multi sales and please continue that post COVID. It's one of the [indiscernible] I'm sure you want to. So looking at the April trends, and obviously, a lot of companies are using April to anchor their expectations for 2Q and beyond and then using China as a sort of the lead indicator for what to expect elsewhere. So just 2-part question here. One would be, can we use the mid- teens kind of placeholder for April as a guide, particularly, or are you seeing sequential deterioration through April, which indicates that might get a little bit worse or get better?"
31,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,31,Nigel Edward Coe,,,"And then in China, the strength that we've seen in April, which is obviously very encouraging. But how much of that is a sort of restock versus the, obviously, the severe declines we saw in February?"
32,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,32,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Nigel, maybe I'll take that. When you look at April, it's what it is. Our April trends to date. I led with outlook description, very fast changing, lot of uncertainty. So to look beyond that trend, part of the reason we're going to give monthly updates is it's just -- you can't project April into May or June or any further than what we are seeing right now. And I would -- so we'll update you as we go on that and give you better clarity month by month."
33,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,33,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"When you look at China, we are seeing improvements. We're returning to growth in China. It's pretty broad-based across our portfolio. And for sure, there's going to be some restocking. But we're seeing the economy start to show signs of recovery, broadly. And it's not back to normal yet, but improving as we move through April."
34,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,34,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Great. And then I think one for Nick. On the pricing, 40 basis points in the quarter, are we confident that pricing will remain positive this year? Are we seeing any warning signs outside of Asia on pricing? And then can you just mark-to-market on where the raw material benefit is right now for FY '20?"
35,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,35,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Nigel, we started the year saying our price growth that we thought would be consistent with past trends and the 40 basis points that we saw in the first quarter is very much in line. If we look forward for the balance of this year, we're not seeing any kind of material change in what we're expecting for price growth for us. We think it will stay in this zone."
36,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,36,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In regards to raw materials, Nigel, we -- at the beginning of the year, we said that we expected raw materials to be between flat to up to a $0.10 tailwind to us. Right now, if we look at it, it's going to be better than that. It's going to be a more significant tailwind. I'm not going to quantify it because things are dynamic enough, but we're seeing it go beyond that for benefit right now."
37,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,37,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
38,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,38,Julian C.H. Mitchell,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Maybe just a first question, please, around the Health Care division. Maybe just help us understand within that, what you have seen so far as the puts and takes from COVID? And it looks like underlying margins, excluding the acquisition impacts, have been sort of a flattish in Q1 and Q4. So just wondering, if and when health care sales recover alongside, say, oral care coming back, should we expect good incremental margins? Or is it just that Health Care is at a higher kind of level of reinvestment for the near or medium term?"
39,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,39,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Julian, maybe I'll comment just on the business trends that we're seeing. So we saw Health Care grow by a little over 1% in first quarter. It was led by medical solutions and food safety. As we got to March, we saw a significant slowdown in oral care. And we also saw an impact from elective surgeries and a slowdown in Health Care in some of our medical solutions areas as well. So those are some of the trends we're seeing behind that overall growth number. Maybe I'll ask Nick to comment on the margin and your question around margins."
40,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,40,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Julian, of course, the biggest thing that we're seeing from margins in Health Care right now is from our acquisition of Acelity. And I think you will note in the appendix, we're now providing EBITDA margins. We felt that would be helpful given the acquisition of Acelity to give one more level of information on that."
41,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,41,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In terms of the margins that we're seeing, it was, absent Acelity, pretty close to flat. And we've seen some mix impact in the first quarter as we've seen some parts of that business more impacted by COVID. And as Mike said, as we go into second quarter, we will continue to see impacts on elective procedures that will be having an impact both on our growth and on our margin. As those recover and as we see people going back to their oral care professionals and electing to do elective procedures, we've also seen that have a positive impact on our margin going forward."
42,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,42,Julian C.H. Mitchell,"Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That's helpful. And then just my second question around the Safety and Industrial business. Clearly, some good tailwinds from all the work being done around respirators. But maybe focusing on the margin side, very good margin uplift in the first quarter. Do you think we're now at a level in that business where, given the cost-cutting actions, some of the reorganization measures at 3M, once we see the sales side improve in the second half or next year in industrial, within that division, we should see very good operating leverage there as well as good sales growth?"
43,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,43,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Julian, I'll take that one. So we have been doing a number of actions within our Safety and Industrial business to be enhancing the margins. The things that we've been doing to make that a more efficient productive operation and part of what we were announcing on our January earnings call."
44,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,44,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"When we look at what -- in our margins, in particular, in the first quarter, that's been impacting that. But I think even more importantly, we've had really good spending control going on in our Safety and Industrial business, and that's been one of the big drivers of what you see in our first quarter margin. So yes, going forward, if there's -- as when we return to growth, we will be seeing some benefits. But we also are seeing an impact right now of really good disciplined spending control in that business."
45,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,45,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
46,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,46,Jeffrey Todd Sprague,"Vertical Research Partners, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Just a little more granularity on some of the divisional stuff, if I could. Personal safety was up, looks like, 7% in the quarter, $60 million or so. I guess I would have expected maybe it to be even stronger than that. I guess the 1.5% benefit you're talking about for Q2, I think, is relative to total company sales. So it looks like you're looking for another kind of $120 million or so kind of lift on a year-over-year basis. Is that correct? And would that be kind of indicative of what your kind of current run rate production is for that business?"
47,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,47,Jeffrey Todd Sprague,"Vertical Research Partners, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Jeff, this is Bruce. Organically, personal safety is up 14%. What you're seeing for all-in sales growth, we had divestiture impact from our gas and flame detection divestiture, which is impacting, obviously, total sales growth."
48,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,48,Jeffrey Todd Sprague,"Vertical Research Partners, LLC",ANALYSTS,"All right. That's helpful. And then, Nick, just thinking about the sources and uses of cash, and thanks for your color there, what is your view on repo? Should we consider it's off the table for the balance of the year? Is this something that you'll be reconsidering as the year progresses? And is there going to be any requirement in pension as you get towards the end of this year, looking into next?"
49,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,49,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Jeff, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to look at a number of scenarios and manage accordingly for those. I think it would be fair to say that it's a dynamic situation. So I'm not going to put a time line of when we would be possibly back in the market with a the share buyback program, but I think it's safe to say that we would want to have enough confidence in the future that we can resume guidance of what we're anticipating for our financial results before we would be resuming our share buyback program."
50,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,50,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In regards to the pension, we started the year with a well-funded pension. And we took, what I will call a minor hit in our pension-funded status in the first quarter. And right now, we don't foresee any changes in our capital allocation plans to our pension. We've been targeting around $200 million a year to our global defined benefit pension plans. And we don't see any required changes required in that pension funding going forward. So we don't -- for the foreseeable future, at this point, we're not seeing that change, Jeff."
51,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,51,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
52,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,52,Joseph Alfred Ritchie,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Hope you're all well. Just maybe touching on China to start off. It looks like the rebound in April has been pretty strong. Is there any end market-specific commentary that you can provide on what's really driving the strength in April?
53,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,53,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Joe, it -- when I said it was broad-based, we're seeing it across our businesses. Maybe I'd highlight automotive is recovering. And remember we had a big decline in Q1. So it's coming off of a low point, but starting to see some recovery there. Electronics has been leading the way. Semiconductor manufacturing has been strong demand for us. Consumer electronics off, but not as much. We're seeing Health Care and oral care recovering as we come into April. And then broader industrial and consumer as well. So really broad-based the market, all the markets and businesses for us."
54,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,54,Joseph Alfred Ritchie,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. And, Mike, I may have missed this earlier, but as you're kind of thinking about the guidance and, clearly, we don't have one now for the rest of the year. But like as you're kind of thinking about the trajectory for the U.S. and Europe, how much are you using China as like a guidepost from a growth perspective for the rest of the company?"
55,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,55,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I would say back to this fast-changing and lots of uncertainty, I think it's encouraging what we're seeing in China. But it's as good as April to date for us because it's a pretty fast-changing dynamic globally."
56,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,56,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"We did see, as I mentioned, trends in the second half of March in the Americas and EMEA down. And in some of the businesses that we highlighted that were weaker oral care elective procedures in our medical solutions, automotive, general industrial, those are trends that we saw coming into the quarter. We'll have to see how it plays out and get a little further before we can give you a better projection."
57,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,57,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
58,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,58,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Just comment here, just says late April, 75% plants and distribution centers fully or partially operational. What -- is there a sense -- how do you compare that to past cycles? Is that -- given that you'd probably be shutting some stuff down or shifts declined and stuff like that, is that materially different than what you saw in late 2008? Is it something you expect to ramp up meaningfully over the summer? Just a bit more color on that, please."
59,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,59,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Scott, I think the way to think about it is look at our sales value of production. And we -- as I talked about some of the benefits of our enterprise operations, the way we're operating, that we're able to adjust more quickly and track with our demand and make sure our production plans are tracking with it. I remember Q1 last year was one of the things we're working on, adjusting to a slowdown in end markets. We are shortening our cycle times to do that."
60,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,60,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"So our SVOP is tracking with what you saw in Q1. It's tracking with what we're seeing April year-to-date. That 75% number is kind of a view over a broader portfolio against end demand and just how we're managing the factories in the middle of the COVID crisis. So I think looking at SVOP is the way to look at it. And we can adapt quickly, and we'll adjust as we see changes in the marketplace."
61,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,61,Scott Reed Davis,,,"Okay. Good, Mike. But can you help us understand how that might compare to past recessions, if you -- it doesn't have to be explicit, but if you have a sense of where you were in late 2008, was this 80%, 85%? Or is this..."
62,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,62,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"I think the way I would probably think about it, Scott, is I'd look at the magnitude of the slowdown, and it's probably similar. There might be a little faster reaction to it and adoption to it now than even then. But we -- and living in 2009, we really managed our operations very quickly to in line with what we're seeing in the slowdown. And then back up again, as the markets recovered even in the second half of the year. So I think it's similar and it's one of the strengths of our model, being vertically integrated with our manufacturing, that we can do this."
63,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,63,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"So I do give our teams credit for reducing cycle times, but the strategy and the 3M model, the strength is there in 2009 and it's here again in 2020."
64,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,64,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.
65,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,65,Andrew Alec Kaplowitz,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So you mentioned -- Mike, you mentioned the impact from respirators in the business. Just following up Jeff -- on Jeff's question a little bit, 150 basis points. But given you're ramping to 2 billion respirators a year would seem like your impact could be more than 150 basis points by the end of the year, especially for the total PPE business. You do make surgical masks, gowns. You've got safety now. So could you give us some more color on the sizing of overall PPE? Any more color there would be helpful."
66,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,66,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I think the 150 basis points is -- that's Q2. That's the way we look at it in Q2. And we are adding capacity in the U.S. coming out of Q2. In late June, we'll get to 50 million respirators a month. That's up 40% from where we've been running coming into the quarter and where we expect to run for much of the quarter. And then our increased capacity that we plan to bring on later in the year, and that likely to be a Q4 impact kind of on the business results. It will give us additional supply into very strong demand. So we'll see additional growth impact from that."
67,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,67,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"I don't have a number for you at this time. It's not clear the demand and how exactly the timing of when that production comes on, but you can use that 35 million to 50 million in the U.S., which the 35 million was part of 100 million worldwide. So you can kind of back into maybe a 15% increase on the worldwide"
68,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,68,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,N95 piece of that come out of Q2.
69,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,69,Andrew Alec Kaplowitz,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. And, Andy, for reference, our disposable respirator business, which is largely the N95, pre-crisis, was about 2% of our global revenue, slightly less than that or around $600 million."
70,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,70,Andrew Alec Kaplowitz,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. That's helpful, guys. And then, Mike, I wanted to follow-up on the comments on electronics. I mean, you mentioned the recovery in China. It's obviously more of a China-based business for you guys, but is that business being a little more resilient this cycle than expected? Can you give us some more color on what your -- to the extent you can, on expectations moving forward between semicon? Obviously, you've got mobile devices in there. What are you seeing in that business?"
71,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,71,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And, Andy, even as we came into the year, we were starting to feel better about electronics, and it was really semiconductor manufacturing demand increasing. And that has held up. We're seeing that and that's part of that broader growth and return to growth in China."
72,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,72,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Consumer Electronics has been, year-over-year, a bit of a slowdown. We continue to see that. But overall, electronics is seeing a positive uptick as we come into Q2."
73,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,73,Andrew Alec Kaplowitz,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So just pushing you a little bit, is it up year-over-year at this point in April?"
74,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,74,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"April year-to-date -- or April month-to-date, yes."
75,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,75,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Andy, I want to just give a little -- just go at one level down that where we are seeing our most significant growth in electronics in China is around fluids and semiconductor, and less so on the consumer electronics side."
76,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,76,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
77,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,77,Nicole Sheree DeBlase,,,"So just following up on some of the questions around cost-cutting activities that you guys are doing this year. Does that -- the 30% to 40% decremental margin assumption, I assume that also includes the carryover from payback on last year's restructuring actions. Is that correct?"
78,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,78,Nicholas C. Gangestad,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"When we say the $30 million to $40 million, that's also including the year-on-year impact of taking those actions last year. So that's -- that is part of us being able to deliver a 30% to 40% decremental in the second quarter. Yes, that's part of it. On -- plus the extra $350 million to $400 million of cost savings we're initiating in this quarter."
79,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,79,Nicole Sheree DeBlase,,,"Okay. Got it. And as my follow-up, if we think about the Health Care business, is there a way to quantify how much of the Health Care business is actually being impacted by elective surgeries not taking place? I'm just trying to get a sense of what part of the business has the potential to come back as COVID cases die down and elective surgeries return."
80,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,80,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, medical solutions, Nicole, is our largest business in Health Care, and that's being impacted by elective procedures. We're also seeing that in our Acelity business, which is part of medical solutions. Oral care has been the more sharply impacted in demand slowdown as we come out of March. So that's our second largest business in Health Care. So it's the bigger part of the impact, I would say, as we come into the quarter. But we would expect, as elective procedures come back and demand there increases, we'll see the benefit of that in that medical solutions business."
81,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,81,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"And I -- so I think it's both, is the answer, and it's -- we expect it to recover as elective procedures come back."
82,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,82,Operator,,,Our next question comes from John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.
83,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,83,John Fred Walsh,"Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Kind of a specific question here, but just want to understand the geography of where something might live looking at Slide 22, when you talk about the sales by divisions. But it was interesting. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about respirator demand, government, industry, health care, I didn't hear consumer. Just wondering if we actually start to see some different behavior from consumers. Where that would show up? Does that actually hit the consumer segment through some type of health care? Or would that go through a different segment and then ultimately end up in a consumer's home?"
84,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,84,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And, John, thank you for catching me on that because consumer is an important part of where we do supply respirator solutions. It reaches a broad range of customers. Some of them in -- through our DIY channel and small construction companies are strong customers for that."
85,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,85,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,But we do expect to see a demand from consumers as we move forward as well. And that will show up in the results of our consumer business.
86,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,86,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. John, the biggest impact we're seeing is in our stationery and office business. Currently, as people have gone or work remotely from home, on the negative side, along with obviously schools shutting down."
87,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,87,John Fred Walsh,"Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. No, that's helpful. And then there's kind of a lot of excitement that we might see some manufacturing return to the U.S. Obviously, you highlighted on PP&E. There's been some discussion around life sciences. Just curious what you're hearing or seeing from some of your folks that are doing pharma, filtration. I'm thinking about if they're actually starting to get quotes or see an uptick activity for some of those solution that you sell to that manufacturing front."
88,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,88,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And, John, maybe I'll start there. We have seen some increased demand in our biopharma filtration. I highlighted as one of the stronger demand, stronger growth in Q1 and even as we come into April. When talking about manufacturing and having supply in the U. S., we are a company that as we took our model overseas, we never left the U.S. We continue to manufacture in the U.S. for the demand we have in this marketplace and then some. We have -- we take advantage of our strong base here and our technology in the U.S., and we do export as well."
89,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,89,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"So our strategy -- and it's true around the world, but especially true in the U.S., our strategy is to locate our manufacturing and supply chains close to customers to be able to serve them regionally, and that's true of respirators and it's true of health care products and it's true of biopharma."
90,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,90,Operator,,,That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.
91,"3M Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,91,Michael F. Roman,"CEO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"To close, I am incredibly proud of how our people are helping lead the response to COVID-19 and managing through this uncertain time. Going forward, we will continue to be guided by the 3 principles I laid out at the beginning of my remarks: protecting our employees; fighting the pandemic from all angles; and maintaining business continuity, while positioning 3M to lead out of the slowdown and deliver for our employees, customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us."
