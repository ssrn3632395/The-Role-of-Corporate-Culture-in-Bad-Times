0,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Leon Boros from Equity Strategies.
1,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,1,Leon Boros,Equity Strategies Ltd.,ANALYSTS,"That was a great presentation and great results for 2019 and very successful disposal. My question is really focused on the future, though, and the three financial questions. The first is, do you have an approximate split of the EUR 15 million you expect to spend over the next 2 years between OpEx and CapEx, including capitalized R&D?"
2,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,2,Leon Boros,Equity Strategies Ltd.,ANALYSTS,"Second question relates to the conditions attached to the escrow. I understand that it's going to be held in escrow, that part of the proceeds for 2 years. It'd be interesting to see what the risks associated with that are."
3,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,3,Leon Boros,Equity Strategies Ltd.,ANALYSTS,"And finally, are there any corporate taxes that have to be paid on the sale of the Expedeon businesses?"
4,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,4,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Leon, good to hear from you. So this is Heikki. So I'll answer the first the question. Maybe we don't have a massively detailed budget on whether OpEx and the CapEx will be and to some extent will depend a little bit on the IFRS rules, what can be capitalized with them and what cannot be capitalized. But clearly, of that EUR 15 million, a significant portion will be OpEx and will go through the P&L. And I mean, roughly, if I would have to guess now, it's probably going to be half of OpEx and half CapEx."
5,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,5,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So on the tax question, we have reviewed in quite a bit detail the prospective tax on the transaction. And we expect -- well, we -- it's actually going to be less than EUR 0.5 million, and that's a consequence of the legacy tax position of 4basebio AG as well Expedeon AG as well SYGNIS with losses and release that has available to it. So yes, overall, a very modest tax impact."
6,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,6,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,I'll refer to David on the tax question. David?
7,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,7,Leon Boros,Equity Strategies Ltd.,ANALYSTS,Could you say something about the escrow?
8,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,8,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Apologies. So the escrow is effectively held for the purpose of any prospective warranty claims, and it has a 2-year duration. It's -- as we sit here now, we're expecting that money to be recovered in full in 2 years' time."
9,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,9,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,The next question comes from the line of Christian Orquera from First Berlin.
10,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,10,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"Yes. I have a few questions, if I may, on the financial and the technology itself. The first question, let's start with the financials. The one would be a follow-up question from the previous one. You mentioned"
11,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,11,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"OpEx, CapEx. If I take the 2019 as reference where you had about a EUR 5 million OpEx on the continuing operations, roughly, it was about 20% marketing, 70% admin and 10% R&D. I assume this mix would change a lot as there will be more R&D. Can you give some feeling about how would probably admin will change R&D?"
12,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,12,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"And probably, I would like to put marketing in scope of your new strategy and revenues. You showed a guidance of EUR 0.5 million to EUR 1 million of revenue guidance. And 2019, you had about EUR 1 million. So can you give some more background? Will it still be the consumables that you keep selling? Where is it coming from? And would you just keep marketing it to Abcam or other channels? So just to understand that a bit better."
13,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,13,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"One more question is regarding the debt. On the operations, you have about EUR 2.5 million of long term -- of -- sorry, short term and EUR 1.5 million of long term. And can you give a bit of feedback how do you expect that to change over 2020?"
14,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,14,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"And then I have two questions regarding the technology. TruePrime had clear strengths for the purpose now of producing DNA. Can you please, Heikki, explain a bit more about -- I mean I see the advantage of amplification against the bioreactor. Can you explain a bit more how is it that it allows you to engineer the vector with a smaller size so that you have a lower gene to vector ratio? That's something I cannot fully follow up."
15,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,15,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"And the next one is with regard to your vector -- potentially vector technology, you said in the past that you probably will focus on DNA. And in today's presentation, you mentioned that you may go towards vector technology. So can I understand correctly that you have thoughts or have plans on probably doing acquisitions also on vector production technology?"
16,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,16,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Thanks, Christian. That's a bunch of questions. I'll try and answer them all. So the first one on the split on the OpEx between R&D, marketing and admin. So if you look at the business that we had in the past, that was the life sciences tools and reagent company, and these companies all have very similar kind of splits between sales and marketing, R&D, admin and also gross margin. These businesses are very similar in terms of how they operate. The business that we're building now is fundamentally different. Whilst we're still supplying tools, the market that we supply into is completely different. We won't be supplying directly to end users anymore. In the past, we had 10,000, 50,000 customers using our products. And that required a lot of marketing expense, that required a lot of sales and marketing effort."
17,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,17,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"So sales and marketing was a big chunk of our OpEx expense in the past while in the future, it's really going to be much more driven by partnerships and collaborations, and we'll probably only have 20, 30 customers which will have much, much higher turnover with those customers."
18,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,18,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"So in terms of the sales and marketing infrastructure that you need for that, that's fundamentally different than it's much more business development driven. So sales and marketing as a percentage of costs will be very modest compared to what we have to do for the tools and reagent business that we have just sold off to Abcam."
19,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,19,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Now you're right, R&D expenses will go up substantially, so the OpEx increase will predominantly be R&D expense. And that's why it's really difficult to say what's going to be OpEx and CapEx because under IFRS rules, it's very unclear for me right now to tell you, ""Well, this is going to be capitalized, and this is going to go through the P&L."" But if you look at the expense, where the expense is going to go, if you don't look at it from a balance sheet or P&L kind of movement, there's an R&D expense where we develop infrastructure expertise, technology, people that will enable to make -- enable us to make the product that we want to sell into the market. So the next -- I hope that answers the question."
20,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,20,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"So the next question was about the revenue. And our revenue guidance for this year is fairly modest at EUR 0.5 million. And all -- it could be higher, but it's not something where we have a massive focus on this year. As you know, we've sold off our sales and marketing team. So our core focus right now is to make sure that we scale and build the organization so that we have product to sell into that high-growth opportunity that we see."
21,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,21,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Now there is opportunities in the diagnostic space. As I mentioned, we're developing this test. There's a lot of other diagnostics developers are coming towards us and require enzymes. So there's opportunities to OEM and onboard some of our technology into some of these tests or some of these products that customers want. But it's not something -- I mean we're putting a little bit of effort into it, but it's not something we're throwing a huge amounts of money and resource behind because we think that's a short- term objective but doesn't really fuel the future long-term growth potential of the technology that we have inside of the organization. So we really want to focus our efforts on making sure that we drive forward that high-growth opportunity that we have in mind."
22,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,22,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"And that's also your old business consumables, right?"
23,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,23,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"It's not -- it's enzymes, really. It's not -- yes. Everything we make is consumables, right? So -- but yes, so the enzyme business -- if you look at it, we have an enzyme business. And the enzyme business, we can deploy these enzymes into these processes that we're developing ourselves to make DNA, and other people have uses for these enzymes, too. So we sell bulk enzymes to lots of different people alongside with expertise on how to use these enzymes or how to deploy those enzymes in different applications. So that's really the revenue generation that we have. Alongside that, there's also a little bit of revenue that we will generate from the business in San Diego. That was still turning over a little bit of cash. So there's probably, I don't know, maybe $0.5 million coming through from that. And then the rest is just revenue that will come through from the enzyme business."
24,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,24,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,"Okay. And now that you're closing San Diego, that means that disappears after June."
25,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,25,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. That's right. Yes. And that -- I mean the lease in San Diego runs until, what is it, September 2020. So the lease will run a little bit longer, but the activities essentially will cease as of June 20 -- 30. I mean that's the plan. COVID is making things a little more complicated down there. So it's not as easy to close confident that we can get that facility shut down by end of June, by end of half year, okay?"
26,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,26,Christian Orquera,First Berlin Equity Research GmbH,ANALYSTS,Yes.
27,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,27,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"So the debt, I will leave for David. The question is on the debt. In terms of the TruePrime technology, the lower gene-to-vector ratio, because with the plasmid -- when you have a plasmid, a lot of the plasmid DNA that is in there is really to enable you to -- they enable the bacteria to multiply the plasmid. So you need all the DNA pieces in there to allow the plasmid to be amplified within the bacteria as and when you grow those bacteria. So we don't need any of those. So we can make a vector, which has basically only just gene of interest with a little bit of moving as it happens, as we call them, to create a much more stable product when it goes into a human. So because we don't need all the bacterial DNA required for the [ identification ] of plasmid [indiscernible], our vector work is much better enhanced."
28,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,28,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"And in terms of the nonviral vectors, I mean you're right. So if we look at expanding downstream in the value chain, looking at delivery systems to deliver that DNA into a patient is something that is, of course, of interest because it allows us to cross-sell to the same party. If we have the DNA but we also have a delivery system that we can assemble that DNA into and provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers, that's something very exciting."
29,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,29,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Now on the viral kind of DNA technology, there's a lot of companies out there already. And we're not entirely sure that long term, that's really the direction of travel of the industry because there's some issues with viral delivery systems in terms of immunogenicity and only being able to apply the therapy once, whereas if you look at some of the newer technologies popping up in the nonviral space, they have low toxicity, they have non-immunogenicity. And those are really technologies. It's hard to say which one is going to be really successful and the driving force here. But if we were to take a position, I think we'd be much more keen to take a position on the nonviral-delivery-based system versus a viral-based delivery system where we, quite frankly, are quite late to the party already. So yes, an interest, but probably more towards nonviral-based delivery systems."
30,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,30,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"And Christian, in terms of the debt, so a fair proportion -- most of the third-party debt that was held by the group at the end of December effectively was entangled in subsidiaries that has now been disposed of to Abcam. So as part of that, and I think you see the reference where the proceeds are on net of debt and net of tax. As part of that, we took the opportunity to simplify the debt position by settling those outstanding obligations, and you'll see that in the Q1 numbers. So really, a lot of the debt that was there at 31 December has since moved on. We retained soft loans in Spain and there are 1 or 2 very minor balances elsewhere, but that's essentially where we are now."
31,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,31,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Next question is from the line of [ William Partridge ] from Perdix Capital.
32,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,32,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Could you give a little feel to the regulatory process, how many loops do you have to go through, what the cost is, what the timetable is?"
33,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,33,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"And then I think you probably answered the second question already, but just sort of who would you strike as your main competitors? And I guess in conjunction with that question, I'm trying to understand it. If you think the market opportunity is sort of here and now, why don't you spend more money, go faster?"
34,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,34,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. All right. And so first, on the regulatory piece. So it depends on what you want to do. And we've been talking to quite a few different people about this. So there's a short-term GMP kind of accreditation we can go for, which would be for more commercial use but will allow us to get product in the clinical trials. And from what we understand, that's something that would be achievable in the next 6 to 9 months."
35,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,35,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"Now if you look at in developing product for commercial use, that's a different scale and a different level of accreditation, and that probably will take a little longer. But quite frankly, that's not something we need right now anyway, so we have more time to do this. So our main objective is really to get into a position where we can have a clinical or great product suitable for preclinical and clinical trials whilst we then look to extend that into a commercial base, which will take a little longer."
36,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,36,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"Now in terms of competitors, so there's 2 types of competitors to some extent, right? So on the one hand, we have the competitors who do the conventional kind of bioprocessing, biofermentation process. And I think our detriment is probably is our -- they're our competitors and certainly people are requiring plasmid to be made by that -- from that -- for that one. But there's other companies looking at alternative approaches as well. And I think Touchlight AAV and Touchlight, I'd say, they are probably the most advanced company in that space making Doggybone DNA, a very similar product to what we want to make. The only difference with their product is the AAV product is really focusing on the AAV viral vector. And we also see their product somewhat limited in that they have very little flexibility on how they can optimize the DNA for the different delivery systems that you might want to target and also very limited capabilities to put sort of tropism on the DNA to really do some tissue targeting with, whereas our technology really enables us to really optimize that DNA for delivery systems and for tissue targeting."
37,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,37,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"And the third part of the question just in terms of just spending more money quickly, do you think the opportunity -- do you think you've got a sort of head start in the capacity, you've got a unique product, massive market, why don't you deploy more of your balance sheet in terms of..."
38,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,38,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So I think from where we sit now, we can see we can deploy EUR 15 million pretty rapidly and pretty aggressively to get us to points that we need to be. Now if there's the opportunity to deploy more capital and to grow quicker, obviously, we would do this and we would issue a revised statement to the market that we see opportunity and ways to deploy more capital more rapidly. But from where we're sitting right now, the rate of investment and pace of investment that we see, we feel that's comfortable, although that might change, as you say, in the future as and when we get a little bit more established."
39,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,39,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"So my final one, just quickly. Actually, Touchlight is another U.K. company, are there no U.S.-type competitors here? I mean I just sort of note that sort of Thermo Fisher. I know they're different things, but people like Thermo Fisher and Genentech are spending huge amounts of their capital in terms of genomics and DNA sequencing, et cetera, et cetera."
40,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,40,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So I mean Thermo Fisher has bought Brammer last year, which was a massive position that they acquired in this kind of space. Pfizer bought -- what was it they bought? They bought one too. I forgot the name of what they bought. So most of those large companies are taking positions in this space. A lot of what people are buying has been viral delivery systems, technologies and companies. And really, in terms of the DNA production itself, it has been very much plasma driven where our devon is the main driver, and they were acquired by a private equity house last year as well. But everybody you talk to, they can see there's a clear pinch point in the market where plasma DNA isn't going to cut that, not from a safety and performance point of view and not from a production capacity point of view. So I'm sure there's other companies along as well that are looking at ways to make the types of DNA that we're making too. And"
41,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,41,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,I think you're right. Going quick is very important here. There's a window of opportunity. I think we're ahead of the curve somewhat because our technology is fairly well established.
42,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,42,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,"TruePrime has been around for a while. We know the technology very well. And we know its strengths and its weaknesses very well. And the process that we are developing is, as such, not something that has come out of only a couple of months' work of research. So I think we're at the right time of the curve. We have the right capabilities behind us, and we have the finance behind us as well to go as quick as we feasibly can go. So yes, we feel very comfortable where we're at both technology-wise and financially to make sure that we can deliver on the opportunity."
43,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,43,David Roth,CFO & Member of Management Board,EXECUTIVES,Next question is from the line of Mark Lauber from Irongate Capital Limited.
44,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,44,Mark Lauber,,ANALYSTS,"Two quick questions. One is whether there's any geographic focus on what you're trying to do, and the second is what kind of patent protection or IP you have around your processes?"
45,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,45,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Yes. So the geographic focus. So in terms of the markets and our customers, they're mainly positioned in Europe and in the U.S. For ourselves, our focus, as I've mentioned in the presentation, currently, most of our R&D capabilities and our development capabilities are based in Spain, in Madrid. And we're looking to expand into larger manufacturing capabilities and GMP capabilities. We're looking at Germany, U.K. and Spain as our main areas to build that for obvious reasons because that's where we have presence already, that's where we have expertise and contacts and networks. So that's kind of the geographic focus that we have right now."
46,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,46,Mark Lauber,,ANALYSTS,And patent protection?
47,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,47,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Sorry. So in terms of the patent protection, so all of our enzymes are proprietary enzymes and our protected and are more generic, but we're still manufacturing ourselves. And then the process itself as well, we have a couple of intellect property in a couple of patents where we protected certain processes as well. So we have protection on both the enzymes, but also on certain processes with those enzymes."
48,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,48,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,Next question is from the line of [ Anthony Britton ].
49,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,49,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Heikki, I just like to congratulate you and David on your stellar year last year. You've done an incredible, incredible job. My question is, have you had any feedback from potential customers as to the -- your DNA?"
50,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,50,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Good to hear from you and thanks for the kind word. So I mean it's all fairly early days for us in terms of customer interactions. So we've been talking to a few smaller drug developers about setting up programs with them for this. And the same thing keeps coming back. Like people are looking for alternatives to plasma DNA, and they're looking for ways to have a high-performing product in terms of assembly, large genes that people want to enter into humans as well. And this is where the viral vectors are also a little problematic. So it's our products in conjunction with a lot of different things that come alongside it. But for a tougher product that we're going to be making."
51,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,51,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,The next question is from the line of [ Freddie Ahad ] from [ Ahad Family Office ].
52,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,52,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,Can you hear me?
53,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,53,Operator,,,Yes. Please go ahead.
54,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,54,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"Congratulations from my part as well, Heikki, and glad to be a new investor here. I'm just trying to extrapolate several years into the future and if eventually, we have a DNA product, which, let's say, Roche managed to use in a therapeutic that they might develop. Once we got into bed with, say, Roche at that stage, are they tied inextricably to us? Or would they be free to change their supplier of DNA? Or would that entail a whole new reregistration of whatever therapeutic they've achieved?"
55,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,55,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So that's a very good question. So the type of DNA that we make, it's pretty specific to our process. So unless somebody else comes about with a process that can make identical types of DNA that we make, our customers are going to be pretty tied to us as a sole supplier for the product that they need. Particularly where this also involves the optimization for the delivery system or for the tissue targeting, it's going to become very difficult for customers to move away to an alternative supplier. So as we see it now, further down the line, we expect to have a lot of stickiness from our customers based on the intellectually property position that we have and the ultimate product that we will make for them."
56,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,56,Unknown Attendee,,ATTENDEES,"I see. And probably a very difficult question for you to answer, so many years in advance. But are there any precedents in the marketplace that give you an idea, were you to license your DNA to Roche, let's say, what sort of percentage licenses would you hope to get? Are there precedents for that?"
57,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,57,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"No. I'm afraid not. That's something that is very difficult to predict on whether that's going to be double digit or single digit and high single digit, low single digit, it's really hard to say. The only point to make there is that we do know is that 1 gram of DNA currently retails around EUR 0.5 million a gram. So even without royalties, you're looking at very profitable revenue streams at extremely high margin from the cost base that we will be departing from. So the licensing revenue is going to be more or less the icing on the cake. And to some extent, we might structure a deal differently where we charge less for the DNA and can get more in the royalty fee. And that's something that actually we saw in the previous business as well where you ultimately -- customers are willing to give up a certain percentage of their revenue stream. And depending on how you structure that in terms of back end through royalties or front end through upfront fees and cost of product, there usually is a cost base that you can't really go beyond. Now currently, for DNA that's probably around EUR 0.5 million a gram, but the structure of that about EUR 0.5 million a gram could be very different if you look at licensing milestones and product costs all involved in that cost.

60,"4basebio AG, 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2020",QA,60,Heikki Lanckriet,"CEO, Chief Scientific Officer & Member of Management Board",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you. Well, it was great to have so many of you on the call today and get so many good questions. So I think and hope we came across that dividend we're very excited about in 2019. We're very pleased with the Abcam transaction, but we're also very excited and pleased with the opportunity in front of us. And for us, the Abcam transaction more or less came at a perfect time because it really allowed us to focus on this high-growth opportunity and have the finance behind us to really deliver on that as well. And so yes, we hope that you will all stay with us on this journey, and we look forward to report back to you on the performance and the updates and the progress that we make in due course. Thank you very much and stay in touch."
