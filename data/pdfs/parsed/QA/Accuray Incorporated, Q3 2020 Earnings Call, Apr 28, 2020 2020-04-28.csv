0,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Brooks O'Neil of Lake Street.
1,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,1,Brooks Gregory O'Neil,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I was hoping you might give us whatever color you could offer in terms of what you're hearing on the ground in China, either from the joint venture partners, from TomoKnife or from anyone else you think is credible there?"
2,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,2,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So a couple of data points. I actually had a call with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of China Isotope & Radiation Corp. about a little more than a week ago in an effort to try and get some color from where they sit. There's no question, they've confirmed that, I'll call it, the pilot light, Brooks, is back on. The -- there's signs of life in the China market. Their primary business, you'll remember, is the radioisotope business today. They're not necessarily in big capital equipment yet, but they're seeing order activity on the radioisotope side and hospitals starting to kind of return to, I'll call it, a new normal state. I think that their belief is that on the equipment side of the world, which would obviously cover our situation and the JV that, that may be a little bit longer in ramp in terms of starting to see that come back. But there's progress being made and advanced on the tendering process as well. So I mean, again, I think that we've been pretty straightforward about not -- obviously, not having control over the timing of when the tendering process would end, but the feedback has been that progress has been made there. And I think if you go back to where we were at the time we last reported, we were thinking and feeling that if -- with a little bit of luck, we might have seen tendering complete earlier in the fourth quarter -- our fiscal fourth quarter and maybe would have had some possibility of revenue activity before the end of the fiscal year. At this point, I'm thinking that from a conservative view, it's probably Q1 at this stage."
3,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,3,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We're still waiting also for an announcement from National Health Commission on the second round of Type A licenses. That activity has -- all the applications are in. They've been reviewed to our understanding, but there's been no announcement attached to that tranche yet, and we expect that -- as we get perhaps deeper into the quarter towards the end of this cycle -- fiscal cycle, we might hear something on that second tranche of our Type A licenses as well."
4,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,4,Brooks Gregory O'Neil,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That's great. That's great. Let me ask you just one more question, and I'll jump back. I hear anecdotally from people in the industry that there's a high likelihood we'd see positive movement with regard to the new reimbursement codes, most likely for implementation beginning January 1. Can you just tell us what you hear out there and what your expectations are at this point?"
5,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,5,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So I think that the general wisdom and our belief was that up until the height of the pandemic kind of was upon us, the general belief was that we were looking at probably a July 1 implementation. You may be aware that as both ASTRO and AdvaMed have both communicated with the folks at CMS that they believe that COVID-19 focus right now has taken an impact or had an impact on the market's readiness, from a provider side standpoint, clinically to be ready for a July 1 implementation. And they're hoping and pushing -- suggesting CMS hold that off until January 1. And that's kind of hot off the press. I mean the communication between AdvaMed and ASTRO and CMS has taken place inside of that -- with that recommendation within the last probably 3 weeks or so."
6,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,6,Brooks Gregory O'Neil,"Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. I mean, to me, that doesn't seem terrible. So I'd say keep up all the great work, and I'm excited for you."
7,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,7,Operator,,,The next question today comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen.
8,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,8,Joshua Thomas Jennings,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Congrats on a solid quarter navigating the initial piece of this COVID storm. I wanted to just see if -- I know you're -- there's a lot of variables going into the pot here. But if we could just hear in terms of anything that you can disclose around the trends that you're seeing in April in some of the different geographies. I mean, we just heard a little bit from China. Maybe you could expand on Western Europe, Middle East and maybe the Americas as well?"
9,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,9,Joshua Thomas Jennings,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Josh, the general answer there is -- and as we said in prepared remarks, we saw probably the biggest piece of slowdown or impact of slowdown as we got deeper into March. I'd say the first 2 months of the quarter, the third quarter, we're proceeding as we hoped and expected. And as we talked about, again, earlier, there was timing -- definitive timing impact towards the end of the last couple of weeks of March on delays that push -- will push revenue recognition on a couple of deals that we were counting on in the quarter, pushed them into probably Q4."
10,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,10,Joshua Thomas Jennings,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"It's a highly variable situation across the rest of the world. I don't know that the recovery, if you will, or kind of the next phase of this is going to look the same in every region. As a matter of fact, I would be reasonably certain that it probably doesn't. There were 2 primary factors driving this. One is the financial impact that hospitals are now dealing with and sustaining around the elimination of the elective and nonessential procedure activity. And as it relates to that, cash flow is being impacted. We're assuming -- we're pushing out expectations around DSO and AR collection. I think we have less exposure on the service revenue side of our business, given the fact that patients are being treated with our devices and we've got some leverage in ensuring that we're going to get paid on the service side."
11,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,11,Joshua Thomas Jennings,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"But I think that a wise expectation would be that service system revenue collectability, just given what's happening from a financial stress standpoint at hospital end is going to probably push out and then the discussion around where do -- where and when is there a confidence on the part of hospitals to reinvest visibility -- demand visibility around that and timing certainty. Again, I think it's going to look different in different parts of the world. And we're just going to have to see how it plays out."
12,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,12,Joshua Thomas Jennings,"Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Understood. Understood. A lot of unknowns out there. And just to kind of lead into another -- next question. But just on your long-term guidance, I think you -- prior to COVID really kicking in Europe and in the U.S. earlier this year, you talked about 8% to 12% revenue growth into the out years. I assume that we should be just thinking about our own projections in the fiscal fourth quarter and then the time period duration of this crisis and impact on some of the CapEx spending in the different geographies and try and -- would you advise us to disregard that guidance for fiscal '21 and then the long-term outlook still being similar in fiscal '22 and beyond?"
13,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,13,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I think the simple answer to that, and I would caveat it by saying that there aren't a lot of simple answers in the current environment. When I think about the underlying demand characteristics in our business right now, I don't know that -- I think China is still a very, very big growth catalyst for us going forward. And I think that if they were the first into the pandemic and the kind of the first out of the pandemic, I think that as the market starts to come back to life in China, I think that, again, the underlying demand aspects of what they're dealing with there in terms of undercapacity in radiotherapy is still a very, very big growth driver for us. I think the discussion in the other parts of the world, again, it's variable by region and by area, but we've been seeing -- as the results we put up in Q3 would suggest, we've been seeing strong interest in our products and demand for our products. And we haven't even really gotten to some of the more important innovation introductions that we're -- we've been talking about with regards to upgraded imaging capability on the Radixact platform, the fully -- full commercial impact of Synchrony on Radixact. So we think there's a lot there to be excited about."
14,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,14,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think tempering the expectations from the 8% to 12% where we were, let's say, at the beginning of this calendar year to something in the intermediate term may be a little bit down from that. Longer term, I think that, that range is a reasonable landing spot. But again, the question is that the time lines to recovery and where and how that impacts the momentum. And I think it's the reason we suspended the guidance. And you can imagine that we're focused on this, our ears to the ground. We're in front of customers on a very active basis at this point. And again, we're doing the things that we can control. We think it's prudent to be managing the liquidity aspects of our company at this point. And I can tell you that Shig and I have a high degree of confidence that we have the right approach and the right focus on navigating through this to be able to compete on the other side."
15,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,15,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,The next question today comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies.
16,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,16,Anthony Charles Petrone,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Good to see at least some encouraging signs out there in the print here today. But let me dig in on a few specific, like, housekeeping questions, and then I have a couple of follow-ups on how you see the coronavirus cycle playing out. So just in terms of overall gross orders in the quarter, can you quantify how much of that was actually previously aged-out orders returning to the backlog? And I guess, what specifically triggered those coming back in and regionally with those U.S. orders, with the China orders or European orders? And then I'll have a follow-up."
17,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,17,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Anthony, to answer your first question there, just to be clear, the gross orders that we reported, aged-out orders. So I just want to make that clear for you."
18,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,18,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, rather backlog I was talking about. Apologies for that."
19,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,19,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. No problem. So backlog, as I said, I had -- we had $77 million of net order added to the backlog, so $106 million gross orders. And we had a net age-out of $20 million. And the other adjustments and cancellation is about $9 million. So -- and also the $4 million of Asian back-end, the revenue previously aged-out item, so that's the roll forward of the backlog, if that's helpful."
20,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,20,Anthony Charles Petrone,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. So $4 million came back in. Okay.
21,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,21,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Correct. But just to be clear, though -- Anthony, just to be very clear, I know this can get kind of confusing. But when I say $4 million aged out -- I mean, aged back in, what it means is it didn't really go into backlog per se. It just went straight to revenue out of that aged-out pool. So net-net, aged-out item had a net-net 0 impact on the reported backlog, just so you know."
22,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,22,Anthony Charles Petrone,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe the follow-ups would be a little bit more in terms of the trends in March and April. But maybe more on the U.S. installation and order side of things in terms of just hospital regulations. And our understanding is that even installations, to an extent, have been pushed out beginning mid-March. And then specific, I guess, Josh, to your comments on CapEx, how orders specifically, I guess, late in the quarter and early this quarter are trending in the U.S. specifically? And then I'll have one last one on China."
23,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,23,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Anthony, I think the -- and I don't know if this is specific to the U.S. situation or the Americas region. I think that the reality is that things -- basic elements of this discussion, such as facility access, locked down travel access between markets and countries, I mean, this absolutely has impacted installation timing and customer acceptance timing. No question. It's not a U.S.-only phenomenon. And again, those guidelines relative to access in facilities, it looks different in different places. But certainly, as we got deeper into the third quarter, those things became bigger impacts. Going forward -- I mean, again, difficult to predict where and how CapEx activity starts to come back into -- where it falls from a prioritization standpoint. But I think our view is that at a minimum, we're looking at several quarters of reduced or moderated CapEx kind of spending. I think a lot of this depends on how long hospitals stay in a shutdown or lockdown mode relative to the -- what they're considering is nonessential or elective procedures. And those 2 are linked. I mean, they are causing an effect on one another in terms of kind of the drivers of a recovery time line estimate."
24,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,24,Anthony Charles Petrone,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Fair enough. In terms of -- maybe one quick follow-up there. Just on therapy volumes, you commented, obviously, radiation therapy is essential. Is there anything noticeable there just in terms of kind of demand bigger -- the longer that gets backed up? I mean, how does that actually drive capital decisions? In other words, could that be maybe perhaps even a small tailwind, even though, of course, CapEx budgets are pressured? And then just specifically on China, just a follow-up there. I guess to clarify just in terms of the orders this quarter, how many of those orders were, I guess, tender-driven versus just underlying demand of the China orders that you put up?"
25,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,25,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Just a note or a word on treatment volumes. We have line of sight on our Tomo family of products to online visibility relative to treatment activity. And I would tell you that we're still -- overall, we haven't seen any large drop-off in treatment volumes as it relates to the installed base. I'd say it's probably 95- plus percent what it had been. And I think that's an interesting indicator. I mean, again, what it says to me is cancer is not taking vacation based on the coronavirus. And these patients, where they are being slowed down or starts are being slowed down, they're being slowed down in cases where radiation oncologists can make a decision, a comfortable decision that this doesn't change longer-term outcomes in terms of local control, survivability, et cetera. So I think that for the most part, we'll continue to see installed base devices in reasonably high degrees of utilization treating patients."
26,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,26,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I talked a little bit about in the prepared remarks about some of the specific protocols and workflow changes that customers have made with regards to longer turnover time, if you will, of a bunker in between treatments to make sure that the appropriate disinfecting protocols, et cetera, are being followed. But I don't see -- we don't see at this point in the data that we have visibility to big, big drop- offs in treatment volume. The CapEx discussion, again, it's just -- it's a difficult situation to predict at this point, and we will stay close to it. And when we know, we'll let you know what that looks like."
27,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,27,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Your question, Anthony, on the activity in China, how much of it was tender-driven and how much of it was just orders that were being placed ahead of a cycle, the tendering process for the Type A licenses that we received awarded for our devices in October of last year, that tendering process is still not complete. And so there are, I would say, probably the vast majority of what we took was orders ahead of actual completion of tendering across that activity."
28,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,28,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.
29,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,29,Tycho W. Peterson,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just a couple of follow-ups here. I guess on the CapEx theme, Josh, are you sensing any change in priorities around CapEx as we think about budgets eventually starting to free up? And does delaying the APM until January help or hurt the order book in your view? And then you also alluded to age-outs going up. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit more about that dynamic."
30,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,30,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Let me start with the APM discussion. I think, again, I think prior to kind of the explosion of the pandemic, I think the general view, Tycho, was that we'd probably be on a pathway time line-wise for a July 1 rollout. January 1, in my view, doesn't seem like it's an extraordinarily extended time frame, and I don't think it has an impact on orders and bookings going forward. I mean, if you're a facility that is moving in the direction that the APM is encouraging treatment to move in and providers to move in and you're not really as well equipped from an SBRT or hypofractionation capability standpoint, I think you've got technology decisions that you're going to want to make. That will allow you to protect your business model and optimize your business model under the new guidelines come next January. So I don't see that having a big impact on the downside."
31,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,31,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"On the CapEx situation from a prioritization standpoint, again, I think it's difficult to take a brush and paint the entire market with the same outlook, because I just don't think it's realistic. I think that if you are an institution today that is a -- where radiation oncology is already an important element of your overall revenue and profit generation capabilities and you are seeing equipment at extended ages and not as efficient as it could be based on treatment speed, throughput, et cetera, I think that you would still be in a mode where prioritizing upgrade of that older equipment is probably something that will -- you'll want to consider. If you have a situation on the other end of it, where you've got relatively recent equipment or newer equipment and you're able to keep up with the treatment volumes that you were dealing with pre-pandemic, I'm not sure that there's going to be a big catalyst for trade and trade up or technology upgrade. So again, it's going to look different in different locations. I think it's going to look different across the regions."
32,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,32,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But I think that, again, this is a business that people are not going to abandon. It's probably one of the few places inside departments, inside of a hospital today that is still actually treating patients. You've got intensive care, critical care medicine. You've got in a number of locations labor and delivery. And the other department that's alive and running is radiotherapy, radiation oncology. So if this is an important piece of your overall business model, I think it's going to be a priority for you to -- based on your individual circumstances to continue to think about the kinds of things that we just talked about, technology upgrade and bringing newer equipment in. But again, it's going to look different across regions and across facilities."
33,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,33,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And on your last question, Tycho, on age-out, as we said on the prepared remarks, we do think that the age-out could increase in near term. To the extent that we talked about revenue conversion cycle, we see that lengthening in the near term for the obvious reasons globally. And also to the extent -- so just to remind you that the 30-month -- age-out policy clocks in at 30 months from the order receipt. And to the extent that we -- I would say, probably 75% to 80% of orders we take today is distribution channel outside of the United States. And before the pandemic, we were probably looking at anywhere from 18 to 20 months, 24 months time frame for revenue conversion in those regions. And we do think that the lengthening of the revenue conversion cycle in the near term in those regions could adversely impact the trend on the age-out in the near term."
34,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,34,Shigeyuki Hamamatsu,Senior VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Having said that, I want to make it clear too that being aged out doesn't mean the orders are automatically canceled. We do look at those opportunities after being aged out every quarter for revenue conversion opportunity. So as we come out of this pandemic situation, again, we don't know when that is, but we're hopeful that we can age those back in as soon as possible."
35,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,35,Tycho W. Peterson,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then on pipeline, Josh, I mean, you alluded to 3D imaging model. Is that still on deck for this fall? And then also any comments on the progress with the Type B product you're developing through the JV in China?"
36,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,36,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. The answer on the first piece is, yes, it's still on the path that we have identified, and it was the -- we were looking at commercialization by the end of this calendar year. I don't know whether or not we will -- whether there'll be ASTRO meeting this fall or not. But I think if there is an ASTRO meeting, it's likely we will introduce that capability there. But I guess, we'll see what -- where we are when we get deeper into the fall as far as timing goes on the ASTRO meeting piece. And I'm sorry, I missed your -- missed the other..."
37,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,37,Tycho W. Peterson,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"The Type B product you're developing through the China JV, just curious..."
38,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,38,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. We are still on the time line that we expect. I think the manufacturing facility that we were involved in build-out of -- with CIRC, it probably lost about 90 days of time, maybe 100 days of time frame when China was shut down. But they've got construction continuing, restarted now, continuing. And our expectation is by probably mid-July, the facility will be up and running in terms of not necessarily producing product. We've got essentially the training facility and training bunkers there, and those will start to be utilized. And the time lines for production of Type B in Tianjin is still on that roughly 18-month, 20-month kind of a time line from now -- from the time the plant is up and open, if you will."
39,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,39,Tycho W. Peterson,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then last one, just on the cost side. You previously flagged $15 million in cost saves. Can you just give us some context on some of the incremental actions you're taking? How material that could be on top of the $15 million you previously discussed?"
40,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,40,Joshua H. Levine,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Tycho. So the -- obviously, given the no guidance -- the guidance withdrawal that we announced, I'm not going to be as specific to the numbers. But what I can tell you is that coming through Q3, we just reported a $15 million year-over-year savings already baked in."
41,"Accuray Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2020",QA,41,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm not showing any additional questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Josh Levine for any closing remarks."
