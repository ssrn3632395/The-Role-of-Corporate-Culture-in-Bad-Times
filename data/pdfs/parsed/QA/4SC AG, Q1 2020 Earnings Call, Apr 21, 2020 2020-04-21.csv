0,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] Thank you, Jason. Our first question today comes from Marcus Wieprecht of MainFirst."
1,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,1,Marcus Wieprecht,"MainFirst Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Marcus Wieprecht, actually, MainFirst, yes. I have 2 questions. One is relating to the partnership with the Yakult Honsha. So I'd like to hear your thoughts, Jason, on how the relationship is going after Yakult's decision to terminate domatinostat in BTC earlier this year?"
2,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,2,Marcus Wieprecht,"MainFirst Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And secondly, on the monthly cash burn, as you mentioned, that was lower than planned. Does that mean simply delays in patient recruitment? Or have you identified some potential sources for cost cutting?"
3,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,3,Marcus Wieprecht,"MainFirst Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And also related to that, maybe a minor remark in your presentation, you stated that current cash liquidity position should last at least into second half '21. In the press release and the Q1 report, you stated, it should last into second half '21, so is that anything relevant? Or is it just irrelevant?"
4,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,4,Marcus Wieprecht,"MainFirst Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And let me briefly review. Ah, maybe on some kind of scenario sensitivity. So if we assume the worst-case that the shutdown and the corona impact may last longer than expected, how would that look like with regards to your financials, meaning what proportion of cost will be occurring anyway, even if you're not able to recruit more patients, maybe the underlying recurring costs in the worst-case scenario?"
5,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,5,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, Marcus. Thanks for that. So I think there's 4 questions there. I'll try and deal them -- with them in the order that they are."
6,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,6,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"So with respect to Yakult, I don't think anything has really changed there. The interaction with them is the same as it was before, which is that we have a conf call every second week, which is focused on the RESMAIN study. And that study has recruited well in Japan. We have more than we initially intended to recruit there, so we're very happy with the recruitment in Japan. But I think we've more or less reached the limit on what we'll recruit. So I don't see large numbers of patients coming from Japan in addition to what we already have, maybe the odd 1 or 2, but that would be at most. So I think the relationship there is unaffected by the BTC outcome and remains very much focused on RESMAIN."
7,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,7,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"With respect to the following 3 questions, which really relate to finances. So in the first one with respect to the timing. This is really just a delay in spend, so it's not a reduction. It's not a change. It simply reflects the timing of expenses as they come in. And clearly, with coronavirus in the -- happening towards the end of the first quarter, some spending has been delayed."
8,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,8,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"With respect to the cash reach, I think this is just language here. There's nothing to be really adjusted. We're not in the process of actively cutting costs. Those costs that have been delayed may extend the cash reach for a period of time, but it's very much focused on just how the timing of those expenses come through."
9,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,9,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"And with respect to the impact of coronavirus and timing on data and studies, I think this is incredibly hard to provide at this point in time. Literally, a week ago and a few days ago, all clinical centers were closed to new recruitment. We were only notified on Friday evening that the DONIMI study would start this week again. We were only notified this morning with respect to the German centers on SENSITIZE. So I think -- we're actively in contact with all of the clinical centers literally on a day-to-day, week-to- week basis, and we will restart as quickly as possible. But given, especially in the case of RESMAIN, that we're in 11 European countries, I think we'll see these countries respond differently to the current crisis and even states within those countries will respond differently. So it's really hard to provide any sort of sensible sensitivity at such an early stage. And I think we're monitoring this actively. And when we have more information, we can communicate a more informative impact analysis for the clinical studies."
10,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,10,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] We have no further questions on the line, so I'll hand back to Jason for any further remarks."
11,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,11,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Megan. Thank you very much for everybody's attendance on the call, especially in these very difficult circumstances. And I hope to see you dial into the virtual AGM in a few weeks' time, where we'll provide a further update."
12,"4SC AG, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",QA,12,Jason Loveridge,"Chairman of Management Board, CEO & MD",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, everybody, and have a good afternoon."
