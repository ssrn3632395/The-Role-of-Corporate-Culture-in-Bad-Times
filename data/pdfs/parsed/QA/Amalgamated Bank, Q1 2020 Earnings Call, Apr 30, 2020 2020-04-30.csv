0,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,"Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question."
1,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Hey, good morning, everybody."
2,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Hi, good morning."
3,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Hi, Steve."
4,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I wanted to start on the provision and regarding the commentary that you expect an increase in the Q2 reserve tied to payment deferrals. So, you guys are not on CECL, you're selling to the incurred loss model and then at that regime, what do you need to see the change further to drive an increase in the reserves. Is it just new deferrals coming in?"
5,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"So Steve, the keep in mind, and this is specifically the qualitative reserve that I was talking about and we're about to talk about here just to be clear. So when, at March 31 we did not have a lot of deferral, we had actually no deferral activity that we were starting to have inquiries come in at that point and starting to get our process in the place. So when we set the qualitative factors at March 31, the only thing we really had to work off of whereas the downgrade of the economic factors, which we took from pretty much the lowest levels to the highest level. So, we did kind of the maximum qualitative impact on economic factors and we use the same standard nine factors that I think many other banks use. The factor that we will be looking at this time in Q2 is the trends of normally be the trends of past dues in the portfolio, but the trends of deferrals past dues et cetera in the portfolio, which again I think will move from pretty low levels to depending on the portfolio somewhere between, medium and high. But if we went from the event. It's not a Q1 event unfortunately."
6,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Got you. Other banks are saying that they're seeing material drop off in new deferrals, though. I mean in terms of the pace, have you seen any abatement in terms of the pace of request? Are those still increasing?"
7,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"No, as I was just saying on the call, residential has basically slowed. Actually the last few days, we've had no deferral request at all come through or new deferral requests. So that part of the portfolio has pretty much stopped. Now, we're coming up to a new set of payments, so I don't know what that's going to mean. I don't think anyone knows what that's going to mean for the next round. It might mean absolutely nothing, it might mean that we see some incremental deferrals come in, but I think the majority of it has probably already happened. On the multifamily commercial real estate, I think general commercial real estate and C&I has reacted pretty quickly. I think multifamily, a lot of April payments were made. I think they're probably waiting the landlords and is probably waiting to see the May payments and we may see some more deferrals come in through that. Now it would not surprise us at all. See more deferrals come in particularly in multifamily."
8,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"The other thing I'll add is the processing on the commercial side, at least for us is slower because on the consumer side, the residential side, we ask the customer to describe their hardship, but we don't require any proof because to do so, would be difficult and unreliable. On the commercial side, we actually asked the borrowers to document for us their decrease in cash flows before we grant the deferral. So, the process takes a little longer to work through."
9,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, that's helpful. And then on Slide 16, the COVID-19 exposed sectors, I'm curious, what worries you most in terms of what you're calling out and maybe in the CRE book, how much of that is retail?"
10,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Well, overall what worries me is probably more of a -- there's a lot to worry about, Steve, so let me just pick the one that probably worries me -- and I know, Keith, the most, because we talked about it -- is our portfolios that are based on real estate whether its residential or multifamily commercial I think have very strong loan to values and implicit in that underwriting is that we will be able to control the property over time if needed to work out the credit. And I think given how widespread the impact of this pandemic has been, it's quite possible that the rules change in terms of foreclosure, how fast properties or tenants turnover and that could mean that the normal time to work out a credit across the industry changes. I'm not saying it will, but that is I think what kind of worries me maybe more than I would know normally be worried about it, if that makes sense."
11,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I totally agree with Drew on that. Look, what's in hotels and restaurants obviously, every bank that has those on their portfolio is going to be concerned about those individual names. It's not a huge percentage of the portfolio, so, while I don't love it, it's not the big worry. I think Drew is exactly right. What we can't predict, particularly with the New York City-centric multifamily portfolio and other things, is when the pressure will really come on landlords. What will the impact of stimulus payments and potentially new stimulus payments individuals, people starting to receive, enhanced unemployment benefits, are they able to continue to make their rent and mortgage payments? And what will be the other countervailing political pressure that will be on the ability for anybody to be able to sort of deal with the property that they have and work it out in a normal way? It is a big, big unknowing to us and well, I think we built a this and the unknowing as you look at months out into the future here were there to be extended double- digit unemployment kind of pressures is just the biggest worry that we have on that bank."
12,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Okay, thank you. And then just finally, Drew, with deposit growth running so strong, it sounds like the pace demand has slowed a bit given the pandemic, maybe long growth, too. How do you see and what do you see for investing this camp? What kind of yield should we expect? Thanks."
13,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It has all happened very quickly and clearly we haven't been able to thoughtfully and carefully deploy it out so in the near term, we've purchased a lot of floating rate agency securities. We do have a very strong residential pipeline from Q1 that we're working through. I think for Q2 -- and I think pace assessments that come on the books on Q2 as well will be pretty strong. So I think Q2, I think we're okay, but we're going to end up with a lot of cash and a lot of floating rate agencies on the books. Now, keep in mind, we're also expecting to have the political deposits start to run off, maybe a little bit. I don't know if at the end of Q2 we'll see that, but I think we're going to want to stay more liquid in the near term just to be in a great position to be able to offset that upcoming run off and not necessarily have to go into borrowings although we may choose to do that and we'll just continue to grow the balance sheet. But our first and foremost thought here, and I think probably most banks are in the same boat is, be extremely careful with deploying cash and capital into credit right now and make sure we understand what we're getting into as best as we can in the new environment that we're all dealing with."
14,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Steven A. Alexopoulos,"JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, great, thanks for all the color."
15,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Steve."
16,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,Operator,,,Good morning.
17,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Hi, Chris."
18,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Good morning, Chris."
19,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from Chris O'Connell with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
20,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,I was hoping you guys could dive into a little bit the PPP program you have going on and just how it is logistically working in terms of providing your customers with the referral.
21,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. I'm happy to, Chris. We are not an SBA Certified lender and as you know, we are not a bank that's particularly geared up to do small business loans. It has never been one of our focus. We don't really have the capacity to be able to handle the origination request and the loan servicing request to handle a small business portfolio. And over the past several years, we've had a renewal relationship with one of the country's largest non-bank SBA lenders that has worked very well for us in normal times. And we made a decision early on -- probably not anticipating unlike a lot of banks quite what the demand would look like to do referrals for mostly small nonprofit organizations who are eligible for the PPP loan. They're not normally eligible for SBA loans, but were for the PPP program. We got about 850 referrals into that program. We referred them onto our partner to be able to handle those loans. Our bankers have helped people through the process and continue to fill out their applications, but our partner has really handled the underwriting and the origination of those of those loan requests"
22,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it. And do you know what the dollar amount is on the amount that you prefer?
23,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I do. But, Chris, I'm going to have to get you that more accurately because I don't have that at my fingertips. Drew, do you know at the top of your head?"
24,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,How many have funded?
25,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,What the total loan request volume was.
26,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We'll get to the number, Chris."
27,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,27,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"In units? It was over 800. I think in dollar amounts it was probably -- yes, I don't know the number, actually. I don't want to speculate."
28,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,28,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"The other place where we are going to participate in PPP, which is really the only way that we have the ability to do so is from a new tech, we will or we do plan to purchase some of their sales of the PPP loans, which it actually the duration of those loans matches very well with the political run off cycle that we're anticipating. So that's a risk free short-term use of cash that we should be able to do, too, is kind of our way of helping the PPP program work."
29,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,29,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. Got it. And then, if we could shift to the balance sheet in particular loans. I think you mentioned in the press release that there is some [loan] purchases this quarter, if you could just go through maybe the amount and what type of loans those were? And then just overall your outlook on loan growth for the rest of the year given just the big shift in the environment from last quarter to now."
30,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,30,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So in terms of loan purchases, first of all we did purchase $35 million of residential loans on the West"
31,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,31,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Coast, which normally we haven't been doing but we're doing that for CRA purposes. So those are going to be high quality residential loans. It's more about the geography that they're in than anything else. We did do some more solar loan purchases. I think the amount there is probably about $35 million. There was one transaction we had been working on for a while that did finally close. I think for residential solar purchases at least for now, that's probably it for us in terms of what we'll be doing same for residential loan purchases. And then SBA as well we, every quarter we seem to be purchasing some SBA or maybe more -- I should say SBA and USDA. They're government guaranteed loans that show up in our C&I portfolio. So we did do some more purchases for those as well. Our total government guaranteed loans sitting in C&I is now about $150 million. So it's a place we'd like to deploy capital risk free."
32,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,32,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it.
33,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,33,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Chris, just to follow up on your past question. I emailed really quickly -- our Head of Commercial Banking. The total loan request were approximately $65 million under the PPP program."
34,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,34,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. And then, just finishing up on the loan side, maybe dive into the outlook for the rest of the year, just given some of the changes in the economy."
35,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,35,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, outlook's cloudy. I'll be honest. I mean what we are seeing is -- I think there are more opportunities now in high-quality loans than there were before this began. I think the multifamily space has loosened up a little bit. But obviously, we're being very cautious there, only doing the highest quality deals. We're requiring six months of P&I reserve for anything that we're currently underwriting. But those deals are now moving forward. Residential, we had so much come through in Q1 before all this happened, as a result of just rates continuing to go lower, that we actually sort of effectively turned off our pipeline. I think we're now looking at turning it on again in a very conservative manner. So I think that we should still see some growth there, but it's probably slower than we anticipated. And PACE will continue to come on as well in the securities portfolio. I'm actually pleasantly surprised with how PACE originations are going with our partners. It's certainly down, but it's not out. So, I think those will be some of our growth areas. And then we continue to have a pipeline of C&I loans as well that we're looking at. But we've obviously turned the dial several matches in terms of the risk that we're willing to put on the balance sheet at this point. But we're also still in business to originate."
36,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,36,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. And then on the deposit side, I mean, obviously political deposits were really strong this quarter and much stronger than I think even you guys were expecting. Do you have any outlook on kind of -- I mean, it's been strong coming into the second quarter as well, it seems like. I mean, is there any outlook I guess that you can provide? Or is it still kind of murky, given the election cycle?"
37,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,37,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Look, one thing I would emphasize is we've seen, as we have in the past couple of quarters, nice deposit growth across our sectors, not just in the political sector, in our commercial bankers. Even though they're in a working home environment, they remain active in terms of talking to a number of our existing customers and looking for new relationships. So that activity has not stopped or slowed at all. The election cycle obviously is also in a bit of a murky environment. It's gotten a little bit more clarity on the that piece of the race, will start to see a consolidation of contributions there that will help in that. And we should continue to see some growth there."
38,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,38,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Vulnerable Democratic candidates who are in their first term had a very, very good first quarter of fundraising. Anticipate them having a good second quarter as well. But we should, as in past years, start to see a plateau start to happen where people, as we've talked about before, sort of raise and spend that an equal clip. And I think as campaigns make adjustments to figure out how to spend money in this environment, we should start to enter into a plateau phase and then again see the run-off of the deposit portfolio towards the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter, as we've seen in past election cycles. That's the best crystal ball I have at this point. I could be wrong by a little bit, but I think that would be the general pattern that we'll see, Chris."
39,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,39,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. Thank you. And then, just one last one on the NIM. I appreciate the guidance. Probably down next quarter, and I know there's a lot of moving parts here, particularly with the political deposits and kind of unknown -- how that might end up for the quarter. But assuming maybe they stay flat here for the remainder of 2Q at the balances payout that you guys gave in the deck, just given all the movement in short-term rates, can you give any look into just maybe a range or how that might factor into the quarter- over-quarter and NIM for 2Q?"
40,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,40,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"It's going to be -- it's tough to see where it is this early in the quarter, given all the movements that have happened. I mean I think you're probably going to be looking at just -- and it's a combination of a little bit of NII starting to flatten or maybe drop a little bit, and then the balance sheet growth just expanding very rapidly because keep in mind the averages that you're looking at for the Q1 NIM are probably -- just given all the end of quarter activity, are probably $200 million light compared to where they would be if you just take the April or the kind of end of March average, if that makes sense. But it's going to be on lower yielding assets because of where we've deployed it."
41,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,41,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"I think maybe in terms of NII, which I'm a little more comfortable talking about at this point, just given all the volatility, when we model -- we obviously had our disclosure last quarter where it was I think about $13 million, down for 100 basis point drop, which just happened. I think we're looking at more like $7 million down when we factor everything in, which is a pretty decent sized improvement, and that's a combination of I think a little better performance in terms of prepayment speeds, LIBOR. That assumes LIBOR comes down a little bit from where it was, which it's already doing. And I think our deposit re- pricing has been more effective than we thought it would be in the model. And part of that is just how fast it happened and money market yields, which are sometimes competition for us effectively going to zero. So, I'm very pleased at least with our outlook, which is always subject to some error in terms of where NII is going to go versus what we had originally projected with the down scenario."
42,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,42,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,Got it. And that $7 million that's coming off the $44.7 million number this quarter?
43,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,43,Drew Labenne,,EXECUTIVES,"No, no, no. Annually."
44,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,44,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it. Just wanted to confirm that.
45,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,45,Christopher Thomas O'Connell,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. All right, that's all I had. Thank you."
46,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,46,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, it's a good one to confirm, Chris. Call it $1 million to $2 million a quarter."
47,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,47,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.
48,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,48,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, operator. I just want to thank everyone who joined our call today. We hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and calm. We're certainly living through a challenging time, and I wanted to leave you with just a few concluding thoughts. First, I continue to be very proud every day of our employees who've worked so hard to support our customers since we moved to a remote working environment. Secondly, our commitment to our employees, customers, and communities remains true to our mission and values. Third, we have many levers for growth, including our sustainable lending, geographic expansion, and new product development in our trust business, to name just a few. Fourth, we also have the ability to drive additional operational efficiencies, and are reviewing opportunities to further reduce our expenses without impacting our competitive positioning. And taken together, and despite the challenging backdrop, we're optimistic that we can continue to grow the bank, and are confident in our financial positioning, such that we will be able to take advantage of market dislocations, as the economy begins to normalize again."
49,"Amalgamated Bank, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,49,Keith R. Mestrich,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And as a reminder, we anticipate filing our 10-Q this evening. So, thank you again for your time today. And everyone, we will see you soon. Thanks."
