0,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.
1,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,1,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So just a few questions. I was surprised with the strength in the Vascular Access business. Can you just give us a little more detail on kind of the drivers of the strength? And if you could, maybe quantify the impact from the Premier agreement on the Port business. And also, you mentioned some sort of value PICC distribution agreement in the quarter, and I was a little unclear as to what that was. So a little detail on that would be helpful."
2,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,2,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"A couple of things. So in our VA business, as we mentioned in the fall, the Port win on the Premier business was important for us. But it wasn't the only piece of strength we saw during the quarter. Because really, this quarter was more getting those customers that are part of the 2 Premier compliant agreements to get signed on with us and start the conversion processes. So there was some growth there, but not a whole lot. Good news was the growth was balanced."
3,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,3,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So our base PICC business, both our BioFlo and non-BioFlo, also experienced a strong quarter. And a lot of that, Jason, too, we haven't talked a lot about it, but we have a couple of really good partners in the mobile PICC business. And these partners are committed to our BioFlo PICCs. And some of these partners have been gaining market share over the past year or so, building up their markets as they provide that valuable service to many hospitals looking to outsource that technique and that procedure to these mobile PICC teams. So again, they choose BioFlo in most of those cases."
4,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,4,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And finally, we did add some new products. We've talked a little bit about it, just around our PICC portfolio. As you know, with BioFlo, we have a high-end PICC with unique capabilities, but we had some gaps in our PICC line. So we just filled in a couple of the gaps with some other products."
5,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,5,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Jason, we expect the VA business to grow with the areas that we guided last year. As you know, 2019 was the first year of growth in many. And I think we anticipated growth about that same level this year. And going forward, it will be a business that's very well run, and the portfolio is a bit more balanced. And now we made the acquisition of the C3 Wave tip location system. Again, takes out one more barrier that we've had there."
6,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,6,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Jason, we did see strength throughout the VA portfolio throughout the third quarter. It was pretty balanced, as Jim mentioned, with our PICCs, ports, midlines and dialysis businesses all growing. So we hit a little bit on the value PICC that Jim talked about, filling in the gaps in those lines. We have mentioned C3 in the prepared remarks. As we talked about before, we don't really expect to see a big inflection potential from C3 until we get to the point where we're adding navigation to that technology. So we've seen strength in the base PICCs business moving in throughout this third quarter, and we see that strength continuing as we head into the fourth quarter. So one of the things that Jim talked about in his remarks was that line that we're drawing between products that fall on the elective-like or those that can be delayed, and those that are clearly acute and critical care. We've been seeing the VA business in those PICCs, midlines clearly falling on that line of critical care, and we expect to see that strength continue throughout our fourth quarter."
7,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,7,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. So I guess just to summarize that point, Steve, the growth that you saw this quarter seems pretty durable, at least, for the next few quarters?"
8,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,8,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We believe so, yes."
9,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,9,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then I'll just ask one more, and then I'll get back in queue. Can you just update us on the status of the AURYON launch here? I'm just a little unclear as to the rep build-out. Is that complete? Given the dynamic with COVID, when do you expect a full commercial launch?"
10,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,10,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So -- Jason, good point. It's been 6 months now that we've owned the Eximo business and the AURYON product. So as we talked to you before, the first 3 parts of the move were, a, supply chain build-out. So now we're manufacturing the laser hardware to our specs and our supply chain. We're also manufacturing now the disposable catheters to our specs and our supply chain. So our supply chain team has done a great job with our quality partners the last 6 months building this out."
11,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,11,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Number two, we needed to build a sales training program and a physician training program. We've done those as well. So ready, prepared to communicate those to the field."
12,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,12,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And finally, number three was the dedicated commercial team as we communicated we'd build. So today, we have 15 people dedicated to this AURYON business. And over 10 of those people are dedicated field sales reps. Each of those have been hired. They have experience in their past life working for probably one of the other companies in this space. So these folks are already experienced atherectomy salespeople. They have relationships in their field in the areas that we've hired them in, and we expect good performance from them."
13,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,13,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"As we get closer to full launch, though, Jason, then we'll give you a little more time line as to when we'll add more people. So we're not at a full launch yet. We're right on track where we'd be with this process. So we're excited on what we've learned. As soon as we get through a little bit of this COVID-19 situation, we can take a deep breath, and we'll share with you little more details around the next phase of the launch. But it includes having podium presence, speakers to talk about the product, how it works and how it's being received in the market."
14,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,14,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Is COVID the gating factor here? Meaning, once COVID is, I don't want to say over, but once this -- everything relaxes, will you be able to launch the product?"
15,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,15,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"We will. Jason, I don't think -- COVID hasn't changed our plans. I think we told you guys when we bought it, we need about a 6-month window before we start to launch. In the last couple of weeks, we've slowed down spending here in a responsible fashion and slowed down some of the investments we are making, just to make sure we're disciplined with our cash management and our balance sheet. But COVID is not going to be part of the AURYON story. Really, we're building a story around those 3 areas. I can't wait till we can share more with you. It's really going at the pace we expected, and we're excited to keep building the team there."
16,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,16,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Jason, we continue to invest in AURYON. And so as we talked about our cash management priorities, we want to make sure that we're ready to hit the ground running when market dynamics allow us to do that. So we've continued to, as Jim mentioned, build up our supply chain, bring in the salespeople, be ready to go. We do see the atherectomy procedures as some that are on that line tending to be delayed during the current environment, while health care systems are looking to build up capacity. So once that does ease a bit, given the investments we're making, we'll be ready to hit the ground running, as Jim said, according to our original plans."
17,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,17,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.
18,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,18,Jason Richard Mills,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"First, maybe a 20,000-foot view question. The thing that struck us is quite surprising as we, like everybody else, are trying to read as much as we can about what's going on in the current environment in health care and procedural volume, specifically, is the extent to which procedures you wouldn't assume would abate vis-Ã -vis a crisis like COVID, physicians aren't seeing it. So STEMIs, you're even seeing fewer strokes, acute ischemic strokes come in to the hospitals. And you mentioned pulmonary embolism. You said you've heard from physicians that suggest that they're seeing fewer cases. Those tend to be acute cases, those tend to be cases you can't delay, they're life-saving cases. Have you seen this as well? And what factors do you attribute to this? I think physicians are scratching their heads. And I just love your commentary on that as well as, perhaps, could you speak regionally? Let us know, are there any parts of the country or the world where you aren't seeing this phenomenon play out, where you are seeing sort of a normalized trend, if you will, of these cases that you guys participate in that are acute, like pulmonary embolism, come into the hospital. And then I have a follow-up."
19,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,19,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Jason, this is Jim. So Jason, good question. I had a conversation 3 days ago, I think it was, with a Chief of Surgery at one of the large Boston hospitals who had mentioned, for the past 3 or so weeks, they spent so much time gearing up to be ready to care for the COVID-19 patients that they've asked some of the other doctors to stand down, not just because they need to free up ICU space, but they want to free up PPE equipment to that level for the caregivers that are caring for people in the critical care environment. So we've talked to many of our physician partners. And as we mentioned to you, you saw in Q3, really dynamic growth with the AngioVac product and really well received. But even here now, we've seen some cases slow down a bit. I think physicians are being told to stay home, stand down in many cases. Now we say that to you, knowing the severe acuity that many of the patients that our products treat have. The 1 cancers and ask them to go home, and we'll call you back with the treatment plan soon."" In the past, they would have had an initial treatment plan, we may have been part of those treatment plans."
20,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,20,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Jason, I think we, like you're looking for, are looking for that clarity from our customers. We're speaking to a lot of our customers. Because we're trying to gain that clarity and be ready to support them. Because we're also expecting their expectations of our support may be different coming out of this. We want to make sure we can align what their expectations are with our resources."
21,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,21,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"You also asked about kind of geographic or regionally, Jason. In the U.S., we've seen the pockets that I think we've all seen as a collective body around the hotspots. Some are more severe than others. But really, I guess, even -- when I talk about U.S. only, kind of all of our doctors and physician partners are telling us the same thing. They've been asked to step aside a little bit and to hold off treatments when they can, not all cases, you can, as we know, depending on the patient acuity. But I think we're going to see at some point, I think some hospitals that we're speaking with are also planning now to get back into a treatment protocol and to catch up for some of these treatments that have been delayed. So I would expect, at one point, we're going to see not just a normalized treatment plan again, but even a little catch up period, I believe, from our conversations with customers to make sure they can treat the people who've had to stand down for a little bit longer."
22,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,22,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And Jason, outside of the U.S., as you know, 80% of our revenue is U.S.-based, but our global partners are telling us similar stories. We've even seen a couple maybe situations where, in Europe, a couple of treatments have come back maybe a little sooner in the last week or 2, so people being treated with our oncology products."
23,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,23,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Jason, this is Steve. You had mentioned pulmonary embolism. Our current AngioVac product is not really a pulmonary embolism product. For the most part, our current AngioVac is used with tumbling right atrial masses and tricuspid valve vegetation. What we -- the product -- the markets that we play in, I think, are good examples of what we're seeing in this dynamic environment. Early on in this process, early in March, our AngioVac sales volume and the procedure volume that we were supporting with our clinical specialists remained quite strong. And so we were initially looking at those right heart and tricuspid valve vegetation cases as being on that necessary acute side of the line that we talked about. A trend that we clearly have seen over the last couple of weeks is that line has moved or the physicians have defined where that line is, and that continues to change. And we have seen a drop-off in those procedures."
24,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,24,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Oncology procedures are another example of ones that we're seeing change throughout this time, based mostly on what Jim talked about, which is physicians looking to build up their capacity. But when you think about the oncology cases and when you think about those cases that the current AngioVac product plays in, we do see those as delays and not lost procedures that are coming back. Now as we mentioned in the past, and Jim talked about the 2 AngioVac product extensions that we expect to see in the next 12 to 18 months, those are the products that we expect to be able to allow us entrance into the pulmonary embolism space and to get into that middle section of the thrombus management space, where we think that there's a lot of cases to be done."
25,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,25,Jason Richard Mills,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That's helpful, both of you. And I wanted to get into a little bit more detail, if you're willing, on the new AngioVac products or at least targeting. And you sort of answered that to some extent but -- with pulmonary embolism. Maybe talk about the targets for those 2 products? Are they products that target 2 separate anatomies, i.e., pulmonary embolism for one, deep vein thrombosis, generally speaking, on the venous side on the other? Or what detail can you give?"
26,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,26,Jason Richard Mills,"Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And I guess, lastly, and I'll get back in queue, just back to the sort of macro discussion here because I'm interested in the macro before we tackle the micro. I mean, society has to tackle the macro. And the other need [indiscernible] as we can get on the frontlines for COVID, you're seeing hospitals furlough health care workers, techs, et cetera, that would otherwise be participating in these elective procedures that, as you mentioned, are not happening as ubiquitously nearly as they were before. Is that -- when we're on the other side of this, will those hospitals be able to rehire quickly enough so that there's not a lag and a delay in getting back to some sort of a normalized environment? That phenomenon is interesting to me, and I'd be interested in your take on that as well as any detail you might be able to be willing to give on the 2 new AngioVac products."
27,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,27,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So 2 things. So again, I don't want to speak for the caregivers and the hospitals. I won't speak for how they're doing it. But I can share with you the conversations we're having and the tone that we're getting. Because it's been pretty consistent, Jason, some of which is right exactly what you're asking for. So we've seen some furloughs as well, some hospitals. And I think if you see the root cause of that, it's because some of the censuses are very low. Some of the hospitals are telling us that the patients census is down because they tried to move people out of the hospitals, get them back home, and they try to free up or create more ICU or critical care spaces, preparing for an influx of COVID-19 patients. So I think that the care they're delivering on a routine basis is much lower than it was a month ago. They need less people. We hope, again, by talking to our hospital customers and partners, that when this thing settles, they can rehire the people back to get back to normal care standards that they would operate in. We also believe, too, even some of the conversations, I think they're doing some of that contingency planning now. If you speak to some of those hospitals, they told us, they're doing some of that contingency planning of how they can get back in a rapid fashion. Some people have told us they may go to a 7-day operating schedule in their operating rooms, to go back and treat people who've had to stand down for a little bit. So on a macro scale, Jason, I think we're all learning together of how we're going to treat this situation. But we're hearing things enough and we're close enough to the market that gives us that hope that when people are ready to start treating people again in a normal situation, we want to be their partner, and we will be ready to partner, as you've seen with the momentum we've already generated this year."
28,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,28,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now back to your initial question on AngioVac. We're not ready to discuss all the details, but we have talked openly in the past publicly the next 2 products we'll launch. So AngioVac 3.0 that was launched in the fall is extremely successful in how it was launched. We redesigned the funnel tip and did a few other things that our physician partners asked us to do. The next version that comes out, which we're not good at naming. AngioVac 4, and we'll probably have a better name for you by the time we launch it, but it's a smaller version. Our physicians that say, ""Hey, if you give us the same great features and it's still on pump, on circuit, so can reperfuse the patient's blood, which makes the procedure much less complicated from a patient recovery aspect."" We're going to have the AngioVac 4 will be different sizing to allow them to treat more people. And maybe open up a clinical pathway for us to get indications back to the areas that you and I spoke a few minutes ago, and Steve did with PE and other places."
29,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,29,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Now the other product, which is really special and unique, we've talked about we want to also use some of the unique features of AngioVac, but take it off the pump and circuit that it's on today. So we want to be able to get to that larger space of people with maybe less acute situations of thrombus, and we want to be able to treat a lot of those patients where we've seen mechanical thrombectomy options in the marketplace being chosen and selected by physicians as a better care of treatment. And some of that, I think, is due to some of the good options that other companies have come out with. We think when we take AngioVac off circuit with its other unique features, will be a really, really competitive option in that space. We think a lot of physicians would like to try our products in that space. And we'll get back to you soon with launch dates there. But that's what we said, Jason, 12 to 18 months, we expect both of those products to launch."
30,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,30,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
31,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,31,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Jim, I just wanted to switch over to oncology first. I think you had an expectation coming into the year where you thought you could do about 20% growth in that area. Definitely looks like it's fallen short over the first 3 quarters and really outside of just some very big numbers in NanoKnife, it looks like the other areas are coming in negative. Can you go through the puts and takes of the balloons, BioSentry and microwave as well?"
32,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,32,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Matt, good question. A couple of things. What we've learned during the course of this year, Matt, we did set high expectations based upon our technologies in these areas. What we've learned, let me get back to balloons and BioSentry right now. I think our sales reps, they probably put too much in their bag, and I own that one. I thought while we're there in some of the call points we're in, we can have similar discussions based upon how these 2 new technologies are unique and work well. But in all cases, Matt, the synergies aren't there as much as we want to focus on speaking about what NanoKnife does with our new registry-based approach and the IDE. So what we're doing, Matt, differently now, and we've learned these lessons, we're going to -- we're investing in and creating a new inside sales group that are going to handle the majority of our balloons and BioSentry business to take them out of the field sales bag. We know right now how effective these products are when used for patient care and treatment. But we've got to do a better job of commercializing that conversation. So we've missed the boat a little bit there. So missed it. You're right. What are we doing about it? We're changing how we go to market. That's number one for balloons and BioSentry."
33,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,33,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Number two, for microwave, we know and we believe deeply, our microwave is better than the offerings from Medtronic and J&J. What I think we've learned, Matt, it's not that much better to offset some of the market size, clout and resourcing that those 2 giant companies have. So our microwave is better. I think if you match them up, physicians will say, it's a great product. But same thing, Matt, I don't know if we can go toe-to-toe with these guys as the way we thought we could, because we were very encouraged about a year ago with some really good conversions, some big medical centers coming over and buying our microwave versus some of the competitors. And that is still occurring, but not at the rate we thought we could do it with. So we're taking a step back, Matt. And over the course of the summer, [ we launch you ] whenever we can talk to you about our '21 plans. We'll show you how we're realigning ourselves. What we believe, Matt, is over time, microwave growth will probably be closer to market growth, whereas the 20% we pointed to this year, we thought we could really exceed market based on how good our technology was and some initial conversations. I don't know if we can do that, Matt, sustainably. That's why we're going to bring down our own expectations for that product. It will grow nicely with market. It's a great product, but we're going to shift more of our resources to making sure we support NanoKnife growth, support those customers that are choosing to enter our registry, treat people and then collect the data to do so."
34,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,34,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And then the final cusp there on NanoKnife, we've already seen how the 3.0 version has been so successfully received. You've seen after 3 quarters, we sold record amounts of capital in either new NanoKnifes or upgrades to the new NanoKnife platform. That's encouraging to us. People really love this new platform. But Matt, we've got to go one step further. NanoKnife is really effective, but it's also complicated to use and is tricky. So training and development of those physician practices are important. We also need to make the next step in technology to make NanoKnife easier to use, and we have that design. It's called H-FIRE or high-frequency IRE. So we're going to put more of the time and development to developing the next platform, which we call H-FIRE, and get this new platform to market as soon as we can, that we think will then maybe match up really nicely with the culmination of our DIRECT study in a couple of years. And we see more and more people who want to use NanoKnife to treat maybe other organs over time. We want to have a platform that's ready to help support that and is easier to use."
35,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,35,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Matt, I gave you a lot out there, but some of that is showing you where we missed, why we missed and what we're doing about it going forward, rather than step back. Yes, go ahead."
36,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,36,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Like you said -- I think that's all fair and very helpful. On NanoKnife, could you give us a sense of how do -- the numbers are very strong as far as the placements going and in the number of probes and the recurring revenue. Could you just give us a sense of how you're doing with that in the U.S. versus you are, like, internationally?"
37,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,37,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So -- it's a good question. I'll look to Steve, maybe Steve has more of a split on the geographics, Matt. I think right now we've seen a balanced sale with our capital this year, both U.S. and OUS. It's been encouraging, though, Matt, some of the systems that have been bought in the U.S. recently are full systems. These are expensive products. I think people now are getting interested in our DIRECT study and the ability for them to be part of the study and to set up a treatment protocol in their facilities."
38,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,38,James C. Clemmer,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So again, as we told you early this year, we knew that the Q3 we just reported this morning had very strong disposable sales as you saw on NanoKnife probes, which was our expectation as we talked to you after Q2. By selling record hardware in the first half of the year, we knew disposables would carry on. I'm not -- I don't want to predict how we'll be now in this quarter in front of us, but it's what we expected."
39,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,39,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And I think, Matt, we are seeing strength, both in the United States and outside the United States. You can think of our current breakdown at about 60% in the U.S., about 40% outside the U.S. We've seen some particular strength in the Asia Pac area outside the U.S. I think we've modified a little bit, mitigated a little bit by EMEA. But we think that that's a temporary trend, and we expect to see EMEA catch up and also be a big contributor going forward. So we have seen strength throughout the globe, driven by the U.S., but definitely some strength OUS as well."
40,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,40,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then on NanoKnife and AngioVac both, do you need a clinically trained salesperson in the procedure room to make those effective? Or are the doctors that are performing them capable of doing that without an Angio representative in there?"
41,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,41,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So that's interesting, Matt. Before the world changed recently, I think the answer from both our physicians as well as us in terms of what we were seeing at the time, to that question would have been, yes, you need clinical specialists in those cases. As the world has changed, we've noticed that both our customers as well as our own clinical specialists have been very creative in providing that case support in this dynamic environment. So I think the answer is, at a very high level, yes. I do think that these NanoKnife procedures as well as AngioVac are complicated procedures that there's a tremendous value provided by our clinical specialists and the knowledge that they have. I think what we're seeing through this new environment is the manner in which we support those cases can be somewhat dynamic. And I think that there's an opportunity to be creative in how we do that support going forward. But ultimately, in the type of procedures that they have with the different disease states and the complexity of our products, there is a role that is necessary for some level of support."
42,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,42,Matthew Ian Mishan,"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then just last question on the cash flow. You were able to do breakeven on net income, but free cash flow was negative $20 million. So a little bit more color on really what drove that. And from here, I mean, if you have the levels of inventory in place that you think, how capable are you guys of managing swings, while also preserving your current balance sheet position?"
43,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,43,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. It's a great question, Matt. And it's absolutely something that we've been focused on over the last 4 weeks. So I think you kind of hit the point that we were looking at pretty critically over the last several weeks and looking at the cash flow versus the net income. There are a couple of points that feed into that change in cash that I think are temporary. And I think you would [ chalk up as ] temporary. So we talked about the inventory build, that's actually a big part of it, right? $4 million to $5 million of that cash usage was in inventory build. Now as we talked about going into the current environment, we were planning to increase our inventories in anticipation of moving all of our lines out of the Glens Falls facility that we sold to Medline into Queensbury. So we had a big build as we were coming in. We have continued to build in the first several weeks of this process. The next aspect of that then is going to be, okay, now that you've got the inventory as a backstop to what could be some potential disruptions depending upon what happens, at least, in terms of our production process, you want to then burn off that inventory, and so we're focusing on that."
44,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,44,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"There was some short-term additional funding that was acquired during the third quarter related to AURYON into the Israeli R&D aspects there. I think that will pull back a little bit. There was also a lot of timing. $7 million to $8 million of that cash usage, I would say, was in timing related to the TSAs and some of the disaggregation activities coming out of the Medline divestiture. So that won't repeat."
45,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,45,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So we talked earlier about focusing on our cash, understanding where we want to continue to invest, so we don't lose momentum in areas like AngioVac, AURYON and NanoKnife, but then being much more controlling in terms of that discretionary spend, the third-party R&D spend in all the other products. The other thing we're keeping a close eye on, you've got a whole bunch of expenses that end up not being spent just by the very nature of the situation that we're in. The fact that nobody can be traveling, T&E goes way down. So we're keeping a close eye on that. We feel really good that we're going to be able to maintain our strong foundational cash position through this downturn. We talked a little bit about initiating that draw. As both an opportunity to keep our eye on the cash flow and make sure that we've got the right cash balances that we need, but then also illustrate our strength. We're not looking to draw the entire revolver. It's not a prudent thing to do at this time. It's not something that we need to do at this time."
46,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,46,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So we feel pretty comfortable that we'll be able to maintain that cash position by reducing our expenses that we've talked about, not cutting into those areas that we want to make sure are going to maintain momentum when it's time to come out of that. And then also seeing some of those onetime timing things that we saw in Q3 not repeat as we head into Q4 and then into the first half of our FY '21."
47,"AngioDynamics, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2020",QA,47,Stephen A. Trowbridge,Executive VP & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Clemmer for any closing remarks."
