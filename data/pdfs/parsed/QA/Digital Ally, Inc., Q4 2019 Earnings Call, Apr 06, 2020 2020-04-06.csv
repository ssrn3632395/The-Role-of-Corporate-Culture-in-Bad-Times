0,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Brian Kinstlinger with Alliance Global Partners.
1,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,1,Brian David Kinstlinger,"Alliance Global Partners, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"With the current revenue base, how are you addressing overhead? And can you talk about with your business being essential but volumes down, where you can take operating expenses? It looks like you were at about $15 million in 2019, which I assume includes the $3 million in litigation expense you discussed. So where can we take that to right now?"
2,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,2,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Overhead wise, we've pared down I wouldn't say substantially, but we've pared down in the areas that really are flat or actually not existent in this economy right now with coronavirus on thing like event solutions and likewise. So we've made cutbacks, both employees and overhead in those areas that make sense. But I would tell you that certain areas of commercial is revving up. Private security seems to be doing real well as well as our regular law enforcement business. So there's areas that we have cut back in because those areas are dead in the water right now until the economy really opens back up. As far as what to expect from an overhead perspective, it will go down. But I cannot tell you how much, depending on where else we cut and what else we do. But we're looking at every overhead expense, obviously, and trying to make it right versus what kind of revenues we're generating from those channels."
3,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,3,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. A lot of it -- some of the expenses, as you can imagine, instead of us going to trade shows and other events, I mean, even all our outside reps are basically considered inside reps. I mean, they are happen to keep the relationships by phone. We do a tremendous amount of webinars to try to keep everyone educated and get new business through those means, but the expenses of being out on the road is nonexistent pretty much right now. So there are a lot of areas that the expenses came down dramatically, let alone the areas where we really did have to pare back, as Tom was saying, that because the opportunities are nonexistent for a while."
4,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,4,Brian David Kinstlinger,"Alliance Global Partners, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. And then in terms of the disrupted supply chain, what supplies are you having trouble procuring? Where are they procured from? And is there any communication from suppliers as to when this might improve?"
5,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,5,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. As you might expect, we do get some of our camera products from the orient, specifically China, Philippines, South Korea. Those suppliers obviously have been affected, but it really hasn't hurt us that bad. We've had some delays, but we've eventually got the ordered quantities and products. So yes, we have been affected. It has slowed down. But we are getting products from those companies and suppliers, and we don't think that, that will be an ongoing problem once the coronavirus thing kind of passes."
6,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,6,Brian David Kinstlinger,"Alliance Global Partners, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. And then last question, can you expand on the press release comment that you are evaluating acquiring distribution rights for several products? Just some more detail on what this might mean."
7,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,7,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. As we look at and seen the level of interest in the current products that we're out there with, it's clearly opened our eyes up to other potential products such as even hardware, that we have the capability of being able to produce and could implement and sell-through our existing channels. So we're looking at what all, not only the current product, but additional ones along this line, how we can expand on that. And again, as I mentioned, we're still excited about our breathalyzer hitting the marketplace. We do have a next-generation of body camera that we have not pumped the brakes on at all. We're still going full speed ahead for it to get to development. We have the, what we call the 250 in a box or the 250 fleet, that's for over-the-road truckers. And that product, too, is right around the corner. So there's several additional products that we have -- we've been working on and others that we believe now with sort of the changing environment that we clearly have the capabilities to get into. And again, one, I just need to wait a little bit longer and explain on, but there are some even medical devices that we have the capability of design and producing."
8,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,8,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"I hope the family and all the friends out there are being safe and everyone is healthy. As you know, I'm on the island, and we're becoming the hotspot. So my thoughts and prayers are out to you guys and your families, put it that way."
9,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,9,Operator,,,The next question is from Bryan Lubitz with Aegis.
10,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,10,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, in your way as well, Bryan."
11,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,11,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"All right. So first thing I want to touch base on and then I'll segue back to, obviously, COVID, but I want to start on the service revenue for the quarter and obviously for the full year, going up substantially from last year, as you guys are segueing from being more of a product-based sales company to having that residual sticky business, if you will. Can you guys give us a mix of how much of that is actually from generating off of the data plans, monthly storage fees and how much of it is actually from, I guess, warranties and services?"
12,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,12,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. The lion's share of that, Bryan, is from extended warranty services and installation services, if you will. The data plans, as you might expect, they're covered over 3 to 5 years. So it's a much smaller number but there's really no costs associated with it. So if you look at shared numbers, the warranty revenue -- the extended warranty revenue is larger and the installation revenue is larger. But there's virtually no cost, very little cost on the data plans. And that's -- so it's a little misleading from that standpoint."
13,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,13,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. So now off of that, Tom, in regards to gross margins and being that there's very little cost in the data, how do we get that number up? Is it just by you guys signing new contracts? Or is that 3-year deal, does it kind of preclude you even with new contracts getting that number higher and higher?"
14,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,14,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"No. I think the major effect on this year and even last year's gross margin numbers is some reserves we took against inventory of the older product. We were introducing the EVO-HD and so we knew that the older product lines would really dissipate. So we took some necessary reserves in order to get our inventory in line with bringing on this new EVO business. So that's really what's affecting that. I think now that we've pretty much got that behind us, we know where we're headed there. I think you're going to see some growth in the gross margins just from the standpoint that we've already taken our hits on obsolete and excess inventory."
15,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,15,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. As far as your sales team, is it -- I don't want to say a mandate, but is it of utmost importance that they sign up customers with the data program, being that the margins are so good there?"
16,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,16,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Well, we're -- this new EVO-HD platform is a connected platform, Bryan. So by definition, you sell on EVO-HD, you're generally selling a connected program, a cloud-based program. We're also moving full speed ahead on our body cameras because we just don't make much money on the hardware for body camera. The real money is in the data plan and the storage. So we're moving head long into that, and we're trying to phase out the older storage requirements, which would be local in nature. So we're moving posthaste into that type of scenario."
17,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,17,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, super. Now I also want to touch base with -- Stan, I believe you mentioned that you guys even had product on the skids to go out on the pallets and then you kind of had to pull it back. Is that based upon international orders where our borders are being shut down, their borders are being shut down? What's the reason why that order didn't actually get shipped out?"
18,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,18,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"It was, Bryan. I mean, because of the virus, they said, ""Look, we want to put everything on hold. You mind just holding that until we see where things ramp. Because it's one thing to sit there and have the product sitting on our dock versus sitting on theirs because they still need to have us come over and assist in the deployment and get them all set up. And so it's not that the opportunity or the orders are going away. It's just a matter of timing when the travel opens back up for us all. I mean just to give you an example, Bryan. I mean, unfortunately, we had -- one of our key employees was out in Colorado and just to Kansas has to be self-quarantined for 14 days. So it's just one of those that stay at home is -- even though we're somewhat exempt and have the ability to come into the office, we're still trying to do the best we can to keep those people that can work from home at home and safe. So it just got pushed back a little bit."
19,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,19,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. So I just want to be clear. No orders have been canceled, they've just been delayed?"
20,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,20,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So here's where I'm at. I mean, one of the things, as you know, we gave guidance of the $13.5 million. And I know that a lot of people have been pulling their guidance. We have still seen law enforcement to be somewhat strong. We also realized with some of the new products that we have coming in and the strength that they could add to our overall numbers. I'm reluctant to pull our guidance at this point as I believe that we still clearly have the capabilities of hitting our number. And that's going to be a big year-over-year number as you can tell, I mean, we're still saying that we'll exceed $13.5 million. Now you let me get another 30, 60, 90 days down the road, and we continue to see things put on hold, then I may, on our next call, be a little different. But at this point in time, I'm pretty excited about -- still very excited about 2020."
21,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,21,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. So you're still confident in the numbers, and that's good and obviously, you guys are essential. One of the things I can tell you, just as a fact, it's being reported here in New York by the Wall Street Journal that over 1,500 police officers actually have the virus. It's -- so I don't know -- obviously, they're still working. They're still out there as a whole, but those 1,500 at home. The 5,000 body camera order that you guys got from the police force down, I believe, in South America, is that something where as we're seeing disruption with them as well, being that they're international? Or is that something that's moving the full speed ahead?"
22,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,22,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"No. With them being international, it's slowing up a little bit."
23,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,23,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. So that is for that.
24,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,24,Thomas J. Heckman,"CFO, VP, Treasurer & Secretary",EXECUTIVES,"But again that one was never in the -- in what I want to say, the Q in regards to our numbers. We never had that one in -- that wasn't even on the radar in regards to our $13.5 million number, by the way."
25,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,25,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. When you guys gave guidance in October of last year, what you're saying is that guidance for $13.5 million does not include the 5,000 body cameras."
26,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,26,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,Yes. We didn't know how that was going to play out.
27,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,27,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And one other thing, Stan, you had mentioned back in the third quarter when you gave guidance and I've also seen you on Bloomberg and given some interviews and radio dial ins and things of that nature that you guys are -- you expect the first quarter to be really big with new contracts. Obviously, we've had some, but you guys are really close to a nationwide fleet in terms of a trucking company. Can you elaborate on that at all?"
28,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,28,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"So that still the works. This is still looks like it's coming together. And what we did and have been doing is working with a couple companies, one in particular, that really has, I would say, the last ingredients that we need to finalize the recipe that we're putting together for the over-the-road industry. We have pretty much everything, and they're actually missing what we have. And so we look to try to get that still finalized right away and then that would be a very big launch that we would anticipate because of our partnerships in a lot of areas would have a very good and quick significance to our numbers this year."
29,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,29,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Being specific, Stan, is that related to the partnership you guys announced with mobile insight data?"
30,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,30,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"That is absolutely one of them, absolutely."
31,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,31,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And now that guidance came before that announcement of that contract. So obviously, if you announce something with the partnership with them that would be in addition to the $13 million as well?"
32,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,32,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"We knew this was coming into play. We just don't know how big it is. So we've been working on this for some time. So we just -- we have to see. Let me have a good quarter of being able to be out on the streets, and then I'll have a better sense of how to give some guidance."
33,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,33,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And the last thing I would say to you is, with your press release today, again, everyone is being affected by coronavirus. Obviously, you guys are moving into a new revenue stream, potentially with the partnership and distributing of the DanaLite solution. Are you guys going to just be a distributor and you're using your channels that you already have with your customers, i.e., the ambulances and the police stations and taxies, et cetera? Are you actually going to be sending in crews to do the disinfecting in all of the work related to that product as well?"
34,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,34,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Right. At this time, we're just being what I would call more of a master distributor. We have relationships with others that will be sub distributors that have different marketing channels that could utilize the product as well. But we clearly have a very nice agreement and with room to bring on some additional sub distributors. And at that point in time, that will be our role. Now some of these end users would be those that would be utilizing the product for cleaning facilities and as such. But we don't see us walking in there doing that at this point."
35,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,35,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"So you don't have to worry about, obviously, getting your workforce suited up and massed up and actually flying around the country, you're just going to ship the product via your partnership with the solution DanaLite?"
36,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,36,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Right, right. I think what we'll do is continue to provide the product. And then those that have a lot more experience at it than us, let them go ahead and do the actual applications."
37,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,37,Bryan Preston Lubitz,"Aegis Capital Corporation, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And now as far as that market being concerned, obviously, here, again, Long Island, New York were kind of a epicenter. We're all kind of getting, it's very fluid, let's put it that way, the whole situation of the coronavirus. But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out 2 things that America needs to get back to work is going to be testing and obviously cleaning. How big do you see this market being for this type of a product? I mean, do you guys see it moving into schools and hospitals? Or is it just going to be police and ambulances?"
38,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,38,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Bryan, we've had numbers that we believe if, they play out, because you do know that we do have relationships with schools, taxi cabs, ambulances, police, cruise ships on and on and on, that I don't want to say something that's just crazy. But I mean, you guys can put 2 and 2 together. I mean, it may -- you may see it, at least for 2020 reinvent the company in some fashion, and I'd hate to say this, but to where you guys are calling up and saying how many tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands gallons did you sell this quarter versus how many body cameras. I mean it's the hot item right now. And some of the preliminary numbers that we hear that some of our end users are going through and would like to give us a shot are just mind-boggling how big they can be. So right, I don't -- I really don't want to touch it. You guys are going to have to put 2 and 2 together on that one. I'll make sure -- and again, I'll try to give an update at the end of the month when I've got the numbers and just do something in the form of a press release as asked everyone that we've been very pleased with the launch. To date, we have seen orders and shipments in excess of x, whatever that may be. So that will give you as much visibility as I can give you."
39,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,39,Operator,,,The next question is from Allan Lyons with Vestal Venture Capital.
40,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,40,Allan Lyons;Vestal Venture Capital;Managing Partner,,ANALYSTS,"Stan and Tom, I'm glad to hear you guys are all safe and healthy at this tremulous time for sure. The question I had, I noticed you have $4.8 million warrants outstanding, assuming you can, have you given any consideration to reduce the exercise price for 1 month and that people exercise that, let's say, at the current price, they can do it. And if they don't, it reverts back to the original terms."
41,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,41,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"That -- some of that's been thrown around as an option. And instead of doing anything new and additional dilution for is something new coming off the table, I think what -- sort of where we're postured right now is just really wanting to see how a couple of events play out. I mean, let's just say that we are fortunate enough to have ruling -- and fortunate enough that the ruling goes in our favor in regards to the appeal, I would think it'd have a very, very, very strong impact on the stock. And so a lot of those warrants would be getting exercised at, I believe, at full price. So we have taken into consideration what you're saying and how to play the cards every day. But that's a great comment that you made there."
42,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,42,Allan Lyons;Vestal Venture Capital;Managing Partner,,ANALYSTS,"I understand. And you don't want to do it prematurely. But obviously, cash is king here and depending how these turn out, you don't know. So I'm glad you're thinking about it, and that's for you guys to decide."
43,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,43,Stanton E. Ross,"Chairman, President & CEO",EXECUTIVES,"Listen, I want to thank everybody for calling in today and all the great questions. On behalf of Digital Ally and all of our employees, we, too, wish everyone the best and to be safe, and I can't thank our first responders and all our healthcare workers and so many people that are still out there on the front lines doing what they can for the betterment of us all. So we appreciate everybody's effort, and we'll do the best to keep everyone informed on how we're doing. And everybody be safe, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you."
44,"Digital Ally, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,44,Operator,,,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
