0,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Mark Fitzgibbon from Piper Sandler.
1,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon,"Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I wondered if you could -- first off, you guys gave great detail on the slides. So thank you. It makes our life easier. I wondered if you could share with us maybe the areas or segments of the portfolio where you're most concerned where you feel as though the borrowers are most distressed and/or areas where you think the potential loss content would be greatest."
2,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Bob?
3,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"It's hard to pinpoint extremely precisely. But when you think of the things that will return to health relatively quickly and things that won't, in our equipment finance segment, I would be a bit concerned about a portion of our exercise studios. Planet Fitness and other low-priced components such as YMCAs and JCCs are about 50% of that, and they tend to not have fallout in difficult times. It's the middle- priced and the higher-priced ones that seem to have that fallout. So I would say, a segment of the fitness portfolio would concern us a little bit."
4,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Our hotel exposure, while modest in size at about $126 million, is about 58% vacation-oriented, recreation-oriented. It is all in New England, places where you can get to in a car or a ferry. And we have -- those customers have observed some cancellations of summer plans, but we are hopeful that they will benefit from people canceling airfare fly to type vacations, where people want to be closer to home and be able to get home quickly. The other part of that portfolio would be business hotels, but they are all in this area. There aren't that many of them. So those would be 2 that stand out."
5,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon,"Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. Great. And then -- and I know this is very difficult to answer. There's a lot of moving parts and such.
6,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon,"Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"But how are you thinking about the provision, say, in the second quarter? And any guidance you could provide would be super helpful."
7,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon,"Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Well, I'm not a fortune teller and I'm not a health care expert, but we are paying close attention to how our customers are doing. We are talking with them all the time. We're especially talking with them in the key segments that were highlighted on Page 13. We've also instituted a program of trying to project forward 90 and 180 days out as to what the customers are thinking. So I really cannot say. I do believe that this level of provisioning that we've hit because we took a very late forecast, the latest one we could find, I think this gain in altitude that we've achieved will be helpful in coming quarters."
8,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I would add a little something to that, Mark, which is that CECL is new for everybody. It's new for us. And we took Moody's models as they came through the door, and we did not try to match it up with our actual experience in our portfolio and say we've got these exposures here, which Moody's is treating is harshly, but it appears ours have been in very, very good shape. We certainly took it as they came with that harsh outcome."
9,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And then, Paul, based on what you know today, do you feel like you have enough capital to sort of ride out the storm?"
10,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Yes.
11,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Tax rate.
12,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And then, lastly, Carl, just 2 things on modeling. I'd be curious as to your thoughts about the outlook for the margin and the effective tax rate."
13,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. Regarding the margin, we've got a lot of internal models that we've been running. There's just so much uncertainty and so much variability here. I'm not going with -- out with any external guidance on the margin at this time."
14,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As you can see, we've grown the balance sheet quite a bit with cash and securities. We're also putting on quite a bit in loans and offsetting that with a lot of deposits as well. So we'll -- you can kind of try to work up your own numbers in that, but there's a lot of variability, and I'm not really comfortable trying to give you an estimate on what the margin is going to be."
15,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Tax rate, tax rate is going to be right around 25%. We did have a discrete item that was a benefit this quarter of about $750,000 associated with the CARES Act. So we were able to recognize that, which had an impact on taxes this quarter."
16,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker from Compass Point.
17,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Laurie Katherine Havener Hunsicker,"Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just wanted to echo Mark's comments. This deck is amazing. I really appreciate your transparency. It's really helpful. Just one quick question here. Just kind of looking back and forth between Slide 12 and Slide 13, I just want to make sure I've got this right. So Dunkin' Donuts exposure of $165 million, is that primarily C&I?"
18,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Yes, it is."
19,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,Laurie Katherine Havener Hunsicker,"Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And so that's what's found, I guess, embedded in that $180 million on Page 12. Is that correct?"
20,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,Operator,,,"Correct. Correct. Food and lodging is dominated by Dunkin'. And I will say, to the extent that there's some real estate, Laurie, sometimes Dunkin' operators, the better ones, like to buy little strips for themselves, but the part of that, that they operate would be included in there. But restaurant exposure outside of Dunkin' is rather small."
21,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,Operator,,,"Laurie, thank you for the comments on the slide deck, but you did catch something on Slide 13, that 78% exposure. It's really more like 90%. It represents 90% of our restaurant or food exposure."
22,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert from KBW.
23,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Collyn Bement Gilbert,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just starting on the reserves. You guys took a really big reserve build, and it obviously sounds like you took a very conservative stance, which is great. But just wanting to dig into that a little bit more. I guess the one part that I found interesting was just the assumption within the CRE, assuming the reserve build on that book, what kind of was the thought there? And I understand -- and maybe it was as simple as just using Moody's forecast. But I don't know, I just -- I was surprised by the reserve build, specifically within the CRE book. If you could just give a little bit more color to the thoughts there."
24,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Actually, I may have been more surprised than you. I'll let Bob answer it. It's really as simple as you described. But Bob, do you want to give a little color there?"
25,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"As you know, it did surprise us as well. And if you noticed, it's a little punitive on commercial -- on construction, and that surprised us. I think that they are assuming that when you finish something and offer it up to be used, that no one will come and you'll have to take some form of loss."
26,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"There's nothing particularly odd or difficult in that portfolio. In fact, there's about $70 million of it is build- to-suit that's going to be used by people when it's completed. So that part, I don't think makes a lot of sense. As to the other parts of our real estate portfolio, when you go through them, they appear to be behaving fairly well in rent collection activity, the part that might be student, the part that might be workforce-related, the part that might be a and b, the range of collections are close to 100% down to as low as 75% in that workforce range."
27,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,27,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So we're pleased with the way things are holding up. The retail segment or the slightly mixed use segment, mixed use is usually retail and other things, beginning to see some request there, but we don't think there's anything particularly not good about our real estate assets, Collyn."
28,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,28,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"It is our legacy business, and we do have a lot of expertise in real estate around here."
29,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,29,Collyn Bement Gilbert,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Okay. Okay. Good. And then any chance you guys have what the number would have been, the reserves differential between adopting the April Moody's baseline versus had you adopted the March? Most of your peers adopted March. So as you said, you may be one step ahead of everybody. I'm just curious if you can quantify what that difference would be."
30,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,30,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"It was virtually the same. As to the January -- the 1/1 number that's the middle bar in Carl's slide, we were surprised that it hadn't moved much at all, Collyn."
31,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,31,Collyn Bement Gilbert,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Okay. And then I guess just to round out the comments. I mean, it's interesting. So your stock is down a fair bit today, but yet, it seems as if, if I take a step back, that a lot of these disclosures are just -- are really erring on the side of you guys being ultra, ultra conservative. Even with your -- as you kind of segment where you have industry exposure, that's not necessarily where you're seeing trouble."
32,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,32,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think that's right, Collyn. And when you think about a great fourth quarter, a pretty robust first quarter, put the provisioning aside for a second, a little bit of a margin squeeze, which is identifiable and manageable as we go forward, everything is in place to repeat our past performance, except for the pandemic and the new kind of provisioning policies, the CECL, if you will. That's what's different."
33,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,33,Collyn Bement Gilbert,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. One last question before I get to a NIM question is the -- I'm just looking -- sorry, I'm just looking through this now. But I guess perhaps the one area of concern is to how higher education is going to look as we move into the fall. I mean you guys are on the hot bed. Obviously, you have a lot of academic institutions. Do you have a sense of what exposure you have to that segment? I know you mentioned it on that -- you're still seeing rents being paid on that part, Bob. But just other exposures you might have to kind of academia, student housing and all of that?"
34,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,34,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Yes. Look, I'm going to give you a couple of numbers here, but I'm going to tell you that this is a dragnet. We have looked at the ZIP codes for in and around the colleges in Providence, Boston,"
35,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,35,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Cambridge, and Tufts over in Somerville. So it is a pure dragnet of exposure. And that dragnet of exposure would pick up about $220 million worth of apartments in those ZIPs and about $100 million of so-called mixed use CRE, which would have a retail component to it."
36,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,36,M. Robert Rose,Chief Credit Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So you might call that 300 and what, $320 million roughly. But I will tell you that, that is a pure dragnet and mixed in with students who go to Harvard Square, and there are lots of people who live over in Cambridge that have nothing to do with education. So it is not correct to think of that as pure 1:1 exposure, but that is sort of the nexus of things that we will watch closely as the year unfolds."
37,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,37,Collyn Bement Gilbert,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Great. And then just lastly, Carl, I understand you're not really desiring to give any kind of NIM guidance, but on the funding side, which seems like one segment that you do have a little bit more control over, how do you see that trending? I mean, you guys are still sitting with CDs, I guess, at like 2 22. It just seems like there'd be a lot of room still to move on the deposit side."
38,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,38,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Well, that's true, and we'll see that benefit going forward. Certainly, we have a lot of things that are maturing but -- and we'll be repricing down."
39,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,39,Collyn Bement Gilbert,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Can you tell us where your -- either where your CD rates were at the end of March or where you're putting on new CDs today, 1-year CDs?"
40,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,40,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Chief Financial Officer 1-year CDs, I think we may be in about 70 basis points, in that range, and maybe even lower at this point. We got with a little bit of specials here and there with the -- we're not even -- we're seeing the appetite for CDs disappear. Folks are more or less getting more and more liquid as we look at deposits."
41,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,41,Carl M. Carlson,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Just to give you a little sense on that, we look at our deposit accounts, individual deposit accounts, and break it up into deciles. And we're seeing basically every category grow significantly since February. And that's really, I think, you're getting a lot of the government stimulus money that's coming in as well as people just being very conservative and saving more and holding more liquidity. And we're seeing people move out of CDs and basically put it in the money market or savings."
42,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,42,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Paul Perrault for any closing remarks."
43,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,43,Paul A. Perrault,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter."
44,"Brookline Bancorp, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,44,Operator,,,"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."
