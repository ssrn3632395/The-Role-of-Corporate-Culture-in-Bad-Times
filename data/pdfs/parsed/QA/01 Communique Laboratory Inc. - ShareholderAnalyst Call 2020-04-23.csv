0,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,0,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. The first question is from [ Steve. ] [ Steve ] asked, how are you going to pay for this aggressive program? And is it true that you're raising fund at $0.12? How?"
1,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,1,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"That's a very, very practical question. Thank you, Steve. This is a very good question, by the way. Short answer to that is, yes, absolutely. We're going to raise an equity financing at this point at $0.12 per unit. And the book is managed by John Horwood at Richardson GMP. And we are looking to kind of like closing the book in a very short time frame, and it is ongoing at this point. So yes, if anyone like to participate, please contact John Horwood at the Richardson GMP."
2,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,2,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So let's see if I have other questions here. All right. So I have another question from gentleman called [ Andrew Levi ]. He asked, you have gone to Asia mostly in the past, what are your plans to get traction in North America? Well, actually, this is also a very good question. And I will leave a lot of the answer to my presentation on the IronCAP X product. And in North America, we are also dropping up some other -- the businesses, partners and everything, just so happened that -- it's not coincidence but it is just that we turn up something in Asia, and probably they are more cautious to the cybersecurity or hacking or whatever. I couldn't say on behalf of them. But our first few partnerships were actually drawn from -- in Asia, particularly Hitachi in Japan, which is a big global company. So our North American journey also has started, and we have a few other in discussion at this point."
3,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,3,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Let me see if there's another question here. I see some people typing. This is like another new experience about this is like a typing contest. Oh, from [ Andrew ] again. He asks, as a 20-years' investor in 01, when can we expect to see an appreciation in stock price? Well, I'm a longer-time shareholder at 01, I'd like to see that sooner than later. And I -- personally, I believe we already should have reflected a lot of the good things we have at the stock price. The pandemic is not helping, but also, it is not -- we have not been affected as many other companies, especially a small company. But yes, we are doing everything we can to make that happen."
4,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,4,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Yes, a lot of questions start really flowing in now. Okay. John has a question. John Horwood asked, looking forward to launch. And can you share the type of new customer you're looking for? Focusing on the launching, the IronCAP X launching, the customer are different from the engine or there are 2 different types of company. More details would be described in my presentation on the product. On the engine itself, it is more likely the integrator, the middle person, like a cybersecurity firm, things like that. But then for IronCAP X, the e-mail encryption product will be a direct customer. It can be an end user, it can be a be our target customer for the IronCAP X post-quantum, end-to-end e-mail encryption product. So they're the 2 different type of product."
5,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,5,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I have a question from [ Vicky. ] [ Vicky ] was asking about the product road map in 2020 and 2021. What kind of plan? Is there any other new product after IronCAP X? This is a perfect question that I haven't addressed in my presentation. The -- our first-ever vertical -- let's put it this way. The vertical market is e-mail encryption product. The reason why we take e-mail encryption is because it is the largest vertical of all, not only because of that, but also that it is a -- something that end user, everyone, all feel -- can touch and feel and use it and appreciate it, too. And it is also serving as a -- and as an endorsement, like we call a public endorsement of the IronCAP encryption product. So after that, we have in the plan -- in the -- for releasing in 2021, just like how we announced IronCAP X last year at our AGM, April of 2019. I am envisioning that the -- in 2021, we will be releasing the VPN, like an IronCAP VPN product, which is a -- similar to any VPN service or VPN product in the market today, but it will be the first quantum- safe VPN product. That will be in the pipeline."
6,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,6,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"There are more questions. Let me just look through them. I think a lot of the question can be answered in my presentation, okay?"
7,01 Communique Laboratory Inc. - ShareholderAnalyst Call,QA,7,Andrew Cheung,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So I will leave them later, after our presentation."
