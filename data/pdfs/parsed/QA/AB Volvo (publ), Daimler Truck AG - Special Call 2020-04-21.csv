0,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,0,Operator,,,"[Operator Instructions] And we received the first question from Erik Paulsson, Pareto Securities."
1,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,1,Erik Paulsson,"Pareto Securities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"It's Erik Paulsson at Pareto Securities. I have 2 questions. The first one is on infrastructure because this is sort of an egg-in-hand problem here regarding infrastructure and fuel cells. You need both the infrastructure and you need also fuel cells to be able to have this to work. But here what you see and what you believe is needing in terms of infrastructure for green hydrogen going forward and also hydrogen refueling. That is the first question. And the second one is for Volvo. You had earlier smaller development regarding fuel cells, but you later on, I think, divested that part and that's what become later on PowerCell. Was that decision based on what have you done in-house up until this date since then?"
2,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,2,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Martin, I would say, start you with both questions."
3,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,3,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Thank you, Martin. So Martin Lundstedt here from Volvo. On the first question regarding infrastructure, that is correct that obviously this is going hand-in-hand as we have seen also for other type of deployment of new type of powertrain technologies, may that be historically LNG or electro-mobility or other types of that. And in this sense, we see this announcement as a very, very important statement to get things moving."
4,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,4,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"What we see is obviously that in the commercial vehicle arena, both when it comes to trucks but also for other applications, it is in a way more stringent to gradually build up this because you will have the ability to concentrate around bigger goods flow for the long-haul operations and then gradually build it up. And also when it comes to the production of fuel cells, it can take place in many different forms obviously, everything from large scale to the small-scale generation at spot also with renewable electricity. So from that perspective, it is a flexible system."
5,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,5,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"But yes, you are correct, obviously, this is one of the key parameters now during this announcement that we are calling for actions, both from the public and from governments to drive this forward because in driveline will be key. And that goes for their production, the infrastructure, the refueling and, of course, the technology on the equipment side."
6,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,6,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"On the second question, it is true that we were investing in PowerCell up to a couple of years ago, and then we divested that. We have continued, of course, the application development in the Volvo Group since. We have been clear about that fuel cell will be one piece of the puzzle, and we have gained a lot of experience in all our different applications."
7,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,7,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"And now when we are seeing the commercialization and the visibility for the coming decade, we have been thoroughly investigating what is the right partnership for us, both when it comes to technology with the right power levels and continuous generation of electricity and also the durability of technology and -- in that aspect, but also with ability to do a large-scale industrialization to get, so to speak, also the commercial conditions right in order to compete with diesel and other type of technologies. We have come to the conclusion that this setup is very, very attractive for Volvo, but it's also very, very attractive for our customers and societies. So we're getting the right balance when it comes to time to market, scale and thereby also a competitive offering that can drive, so to speak, the shift into a CO2-neutral society."
8,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,8,Erik Paulsson,"Pareto Securities, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Just a brief follow up there on the infrastructure side. Do you plan to invest anything on the infrastructure side coming -- going forward now in this joint venture? Is it only on the equipment side of the fuel cells?
9,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,9,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. To follow up on that, so this joint venture is about the development -- technology development, the industrialization, production of fuel cell systems. That is then, of course, a core component, but that -- then should be implemented in different type of applications at Volvo or Daimler or at other interested parties down the road. So those are the fuel cell systems we are talking about onboard, so to speak."
10,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,10,Operator,,,The next question we received is from Ilan Rosenberg from Reuters.
11,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,11,Ilan Rosenberg;Reuters;Media,,ATTENDEES,"I would be interested if the EUR 600 million that are invested or are paid by Volvo will be invested into the joint venture? Or what would be an investment amount that is planned? So far, I think we haven't got very precise numbers on the side of Daimler yet. And when you call for the public to support this endeavor, how do you see the perspective for state subsidies in building up this infrastructure because this is already a longer standing point that is raised by the industry? And the third question is, what role did Geely play? Is this a project -- well -- in all this work program of Daimler and Geely to find common projects?"
12,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,12,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Martin, I try to answer, but you can chime in as well any time. Let's start with the last one because it's the easiest one. Geely has nothing to do with it. It's absolutely -- it's neither a joint project nor was Geely in any way involved into that doing. And because it's not a public information, I don't think even that Geely was informed about that thing, as the general public wasn't informed before we -- today is the time when we inform the public."
13,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,13,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Secondly, the infrastructure side, yes, there is a long-standing demand that we need a hydrogen infrastructure. But first, it was important to do the first step. And then someone else used the phrase hand-egg problem, yes, so let's be us the starting point to -- and it takes its time until the technology is serious production ready. So nobody should not waste the time in building other respective infrastructure. But now it comes to your last question. Daimler is forming a fuel cell entity, legal entity. Into that entity, we bring everything we have in the last 25 years accomplished in fuel cell: the people, the know-how, the"
14,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,14,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"IT rights, and the production infrastructure that we have that helped us to produce a couple of 100 test cars and to power a sizable amount of city buses."
15,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,15,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"So we bring those things into one company. Volvo is purchasing 50% of that company for EUR 600 million -- slightly above EUR 600 million. We both parties agreed that we significantly will invest in the future. And it will be from both sides at partly because we are 50-50, it will be 7, 8 -- it will be a 9 digit amount of money that will flow -- start to flow immediately and it's more necessary until we are ultimately ready to have that technology going in the marketplace."
16,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,16,Ilan Rosenberg;Reuters;Media,,ATTENDEES,That was a 9-digit amount of money?
17,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,17,Ilan Rosenberg;Reuters;Media,,ATTENDEES,"Yes. From both sides each, at least."
18,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,18,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,The next question we received is from William Boston from Wall Street Journal.
19,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,19,William Boston;Wall Street Journal;Media,,ATTENDEES,"I just have 3 quick questions. One, in terms of employees, how is the -- how many employees is the company going to have when it starts? And second, will you give a -- what's your vision in terms of a road map for the deployment of fuel cell infrastructure and vehicles? I mean when will we see fuel cell fleets operating on the highways? What will that look like? And my last question is about other partners, whether or not you're open to other partners. We have some manufacturers like BMW that have made fuel cell more of a priority over the last year or so. Are you open to more cooperation with -- or are you open to other companies joining the venture?"
20,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,20,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,Martin?
21,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,21,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. To start with, if I start with the first part of the question, it's approximately 250 employees, experts, that will be, so to speak, starting in the joint venture now when that is -- or in the entity of Daimler Truck fuel cell to start with and then eventually moving into the joint venture structure when Volvo is coming on board after also the necessary clearance with authorities, et cetera. So approximately 250. But of course, our vision going along as this will continue to be developed, we have to evaluate what is the right level, both when it comes to the development technology area but also when it gradually moves into the industrialization area. But that is the starting point."
22,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,22,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"When it comes to the road map, we have been very clear that this is a very important part of the road map, up to 2030 primarily, to reach also a sustainable level when it comes to the CO2 targets for Europe but also for other parts of the world and not at least then for heavy applications and long haulage and long distance and other applications where a lot of energy is required on board different type of applications. And therefore, we are foreseeing a gradual commercialization, deployment during the latter part of this decade."
23,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,23,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"And then coming back to Martin's statement before, that's the reason why it has been very important to have a consistent and common view about how we foresee the investments moving forward here, so we can really keep the line and make this a very viable part of future green transportations and not at least then as a strong sign."
24,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,24,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Similar to Martin, I've been 30 years in this industry, and fuel cells have always been 10 years away since"
25,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,25,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"I thought in the beginning of the '90s. But for the first time in my career, it's sooner than 10 years away."
26,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,26,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"And this is a very, very strong sign and call that in order to make the shift, we need to make the shift together with a lot of other partners in the network, not at least when it comes to infrastructure and production of hydrogen."
27,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,27,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Then when it comes to partners, as I said, we are -- we have a 50-50 joint venture agreement. That is the starting point. The setup of developing an industrialized and commercialized fuel cell systems allow, of course, an opportunity also to deploy this to other actors. If that is an interest of that because our intention is to buy this technology that we are deeming to be in the forefront for these type of applications, to deploy that so we can get a large scale necessary to get the business case viable for our customers and for society."
28,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,28,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"And I can only support that what Martin just said is this joint venture company will produce a fuel cell stack in an aggregate that goes in both in the Daimler truck and a Volvo truck, and it can go in other vehicles as well or we can think in off-highway usage like power generation and so on. So we want to establish here a company that serves not just the 2 shareholder, but why not the entire industry. But this"
29,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,29,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"-- first serve the shareholders and do a great job here, and then the rest will fall in place. Our clear target is to have the most competitive, the most capable fuel cell system in the market, and we can build upon a readily available technology."
30,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,30,Operator,,,So the next question is from Christoph Rauwald from Bloomberg News.
31,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,31,Christoph Rauwald;Bloomberg News;Media,,ATTENDEES,"I just have one quick follow-up question, please. The release you sent out suggests that geographically the joint venture will be focused primarily in Europe. Would the technology also be considered for other regions potentially, given that both Daimler Trucks and Volvo have a strong footprint, for example, in America, so would potentially be a use case in America, something that you could envision? And would that also be an option for China including your respective joint venture partners?"
32,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,32,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"I mean definitely, in my -- we have both on the truck side, both Volvo and we have the same strategy that our trucks on both sides of the ocean have the same technical DNA. So what works in one truck always works in the other truck. And secondly, our fuel cell joint venture will have a significant subsidiary in Vancouver, BC, Canada. So we already have our foot on the North American continent. And whenever regulation and environment necessities are right, we'll certainly can see that on the other side."
33,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,33,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"And the other side, and I think that was from the get-go with Martin Lundstedt and me always made it easy when we debate it. We have one basic principle: focus on one thing and do it right. And if you do that one thing right, then other things automatically will fall in place."
34,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,34,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,The next question we received is from [indiscernible] from [indiscernible].
35,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,35,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"I would like to ask, because some questions have already been stated here, but this cooperation, how much is it -- in fact, how much is it due to the coronavirus crisis? Were you in negotiations with this joint venture before? Or how much is it due to the crisis that we've all seen on the global pandemic?"
36,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,36,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, [indiscernible]. Martin here -- Martin Lundstedt here. Yes. We are fast, but we are not direction and investment that requires, I mean in-depth discussions and understanding, of course, about technology, business model setup, but more importantly also about common values, how to drive a transformation of this magnitude because we are talking about game-changing transformation for transportation and thereby for global societies that is needed. We know that we cannot just continue on the trajectory that we have had when it comes to transportation, given increased population, increased density in urban areas, but also increased goods flows, thanks, for example, to increased trade and e- commerce."
37,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,37,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"And thereby, we see that we are -- we need to continue to invest heavily in technology and we have said that if Europe are to continue to be a leading actor when it comes to the heavy transportation, you need to be leading in the green shift and the truly green shift. And electro-mobility is the cornerstone, battery electric will be complemented by fuel cells. And then to do that, you need also to shift it into the infrastructure and upstream production of it. So this has been ongoing for a while. And if anything, as Martin Daum pointed out, the coronavirus has just convinced us even more because prioritization will be even stronger after this very difficult situation. But this is an area that needs continuous focus and thereby having the right type of setup."
38,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,38,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,So how long has these negotiations been ongoing then?
39,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,39,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,The next question is from Ola [indiscernible]
40,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,40,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"We do not comment that exactly, but it has been ongoing for a while in order to get things right and to really share a setup that will be consistent and have the right requisite to be long-term viable."
41,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,41,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Mr. Daum, to -- for what range of heavy transport do you plan, fuel cell stack, for what size of [indiscernible] will the auto be usable for light trucks, for example? Or is it especially designed for mobility, especially designed for heavy trucks?"
42,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,42,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Look, you can say, it's actually a fuel cell truck and a battery electric truck about electric trucks. So there is electric current going into an electric engine, going to electric axle and propel a truck forward. The question is, do you get your energy out of stored energy, a battery or do you produce it basically on the truck? And you can say rule of thumb is as longer the route and is heavier the load, it's more likely to generate it on the truck because battery does not have the necessary density of energy to store. And so it means on the other side is shorter the route and is lighter the load, it's more likely you use a battery. And everything else, depends on infrastructure, on a lot of things."
43,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,43,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Trucks are specifically designed vehicles and both are necessary and we'll have to figure out that in the future, how infrastructure develop, how legal, environmental restriction go on, how raw materials are developing. There's a lot of open questions, which then will determine in the future which is the share of what technology."
44,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,44,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,The next question we received is from [indiscernible].
45,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,45,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"I have three questions for Martin Daum. First question is, what happens with the cars with fuel cells? Will will be the headquarter of the joint venture? And third question is, I didn't really get the point, how much you want to invest. So could you say clear how many money do you want to invest in how many years?"
46,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,46,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"[indiscernible], thanks for the question. First of all, the GLC project, car project, is nearly done as we speak. The last year, these fuel cell will be produced and handed over to customers. At the moment, we don't plan another car. Car is focusing on battery. Here, the same rule of physics applies: as lighter the load, as shorter the distance. And when we talk distance in truck, we talk really distance. Yes. This is not what a test car guy other than going into driving to vacation is doing during a day."
47,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,47,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"So on the car side, we don't have plans for the moment. But we have all the possibilities to come back any time if there is a market and a necessity. So it's a good and seamless transition from one application to the other. And in the past, we're on the truck side, we're always part of the fuel cell project, especially with our bus division."
48,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,48,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"The headquarter of the new unit will be in Nabern, where we have today, let's say, the core of our expertise for fuel cells, and we want to keep that for the joint venture as well. Will we invest? It's difficult to give a precise number, but it will be a lot. And we certainly, on the one side, try to minimize it as much as possible. When I spoke of 9-digit numbers, that means EUR 100 million, each means EUR 200 million. That's a good starting number, but it definitely won't be enough to have, at the end, full, serious production. So we will have to spend quite some money to make it happen, but both parties have the willingness and the key understanding that they're doing that in the next 3, 4 years. And we certainly, Mr. [indiscernible], keep you informed whenever we have more precise numbers."
49,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,49,Operator,,,"The next question we received is from Daniela Costa, Goldman Sachs."
50,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,50,Daniela C. R. de Carvalho e Costa,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I only have one question left, and it's on the Volvo side. I was wondering, Martin, if you could give us any guidance on how you came up on how -- jointly, how you came up with the EUR 600 million cash spend, I guess. How do you think about valuation in a business like this where the business actually hasn't started?"
51,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,51,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you very much for the question. And obviously -- and I think also partly Martin Daum has been into that. And also from my side, we have been working now during a period of time to do, so to speak, the different type of due diligence that is as we deem it possible to be done up to this part of the process, given the fact that we now are announcing and are also starting the normal proceedings with the concerned authorities. But of course, this is -- as always, when it comes to these type of investments, a mix between the value that we have put into the technology, the IT portfolio, the readiness, the technology characteristics, but also on the way forward of the ability to industrialize and to make it successful and in comparison with other alternatives for us when it comes to getting to a level where fuel cell that have to play an important role in the CO2-neutral society. And when we are mixing that, I will not go into the exact details we have concluded on this valuation."
52,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,52,Operator,,,The next question we received is from Megan Lampinen from Automotive World.
53,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,53,Megan Lampinen;Automotive World;Media,,ATTENDEES,"I was interested in hearing about key metrics. Are you aiming in the long run for a fuel cell truck that can best diesel on all counts in terms of performance and costs, et cetera? There is another player out there expect there to be some compromise? And I'm also interested in whether you expect to make a loss on your initial models and how long before they would be profitable?"
54,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,54,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Could you please repeat the last question, please? I got -- audio was a little bit compromised."
55,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,55,Megan Lampinen;Automotive World;Media,,ATTENDEES,Yes. I'm interested on whether you expect to take a loss on the initial models and how long before they would be profitable?
56,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,56,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"I mean the first question is easy to answer. We -- to fulfill the Paris Accord 2050, we can't sell any more combustion engines. And in my opinion, that has to be started early as 2040. Otherwise, we don't limit the warming of our planet, especially because trucks have a pretty long life span, running for at least 10 years. So we have to find CO2-neutral solutions for all types of truck applications. And that is, well, let's say, for 95% on the majority of all applications. And therefore, yes, a fuel cell truck has to deliver the same performance in durability, the same performance in torque and strength and the same performance, ultimately, in efficiency than a diesel truck has."
57,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,57,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"The last one is potentially the most difficult one, but we have -- therefore, for me, for the foreseeable future, it will be more expensive. So here we'll have to see how regulation develop and how that is there. And it will be always an electric truck. And the question is, is there electricity coming out of the socket and the battery or is it produced through hydrogen in the truck itself? And so yes I'm pretty optimistic that 20 years from now, this will cover the entire market in 95% of the applications."
58,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,58,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"And maybe, Martin, you have to complement from my side. And I think that is also the reason for the construct of the joint venture that this is about the development of the fuel cell stack and the deployment of that. And that is the joint interest to drive volume in order to get both the right performance and the right, so to speak, input levels. But then it is the deployment that goes for the different parties in order to make a competitive application into respective vehicles or other applications. And we think that is a contract that will drive both economic efficiencies for society and for customers, and it will drive also sustainability efficiencies for society and that is the reason of having a construct of this sort in the joint venture."
59,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,59,Operator,,,"The next question received is from Nicolai Kempf, Deutsche Bank."
60,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,60,Nicolai Kempf,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Nicolai Kempf here from Deutsche Bank. I have 2 follow-up question. So the first one would be, if you can make a wish for the government to help you in this joint venture, what would it be, a large infrastructure, common standards or purchase incentives for fuel trucks? And the second one, in which year would you expect to have the first truck with this technology on the road?"
61,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,61,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"I would say -- Martin, I go first, and you add to that. For me, the first thing is government certainly is asked when it comes to infrastructure because this is a huge endeavor, especially if we talk about green it's never a good solution if you subsidize something. It has to be ultimately an economical solution. That means the only subsidies I could see is for a couple of first seeding trucks. So people start getting -- making their experiences with trucks and infrastructure is not perfect and you basically lose money with those trucks. But when they become a household good in the mid- of the second half of this decade, then it has to be a business case for our customers without subsidies."
62,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,62,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"And the last one is, when do we go on the road? This is, in our business, always, there are 3 phases. It's always a starting phase where you have a couple of trucks out. So you gain the first experiences. Then you have a kind of a pre-serious phase where you have limited applications in limited areas, a limited number of trucks. That is at the moment what our passenger car colleagues are doing with the GLC, which is a tool in serious production. But the real thing you are striving for is what I call serious production. That means any number of trucks, any region in Europe, whenever the customer orders, we or Volvo delivers. And that will take a little bit longer than the first two. I would say the first two we want to have as fast as possible. That means potentially as early as 2024, 2025. The second one will take until the mid- of next decade."
63,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,63,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Martin, what's on your [indiscernible]? Future-oriented statements sometimes have different opinions. Therefore, what's your opinion on that?"
64,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,64,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"No. But again, what I think is important is that we are stating that we are building on from a basic technology both experience and competence technology level that is, I should not say, mature from a serious production, but it's starting to be visible from durability and from power outputs, et cetera. So it's starting to be seen as a truly viable option for the rollout to 2030."
65,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,65,Operator,,,The next question we received is from Edward Taylor from Reuters.
66,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,66,Edward Taylor;Reuters;Media,,ATTENDEES,Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what has driven you to decide that now is the era of commercializing hydrogen fuel cell trucks? Is it just the pressure to meet your CO2 rules or do you see a sort of a broader market where you can license the product to other third-party manufacturers? And is there a lockup agreement for you to keep the 50-50 stakes for now?
67,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,67,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"If I may start, Martin, I will say, of course, a very important element is the different road maps of CO2 regulations. But I think, also to be fair, when we are looking into our customer base but also our customers' customers and society as a whole and also our own employees, there is a real driving force of being part of the solution."
68,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,68,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Transportation will play an essential role to achieve the commitments that all of us have put up when it comes to the Paris Agreement and beyond. And in order to reach those levels, we need to get started when it comes to the long-haul and the most heavy applications to complement the battery electric vehicles when it comes to electric powertrains. And therefore, it's a combination between, so to speak, the legislative landscape in certain regions, but it's also the willingness to drive true transformation into our industry because that will be a competitive edge for anyone that is participating."
69,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,69,Martin Lundstedt,"CEO, President, Member of the Group Executive Board & Director AB Volvo (publ)",EXECUTIVES,"Secondly, I think it's also important to understand that the ability of generating green electricity is improving every day, both when it comes to solar, when it comes to wind, when it comes to other sources. And by that, you will also find new solutions, both when it comes to small and large-scale generation of electricity that can actually power the process of generating hydrogen in different forms and thereby also finding a mix of the infrastructure and the upfront production of hydrogen so -- from a green basis. And as such and the readiness of having electric powertrains to host, so to speak, this type of energy layer has driven us, at least, to come to the conclusion this is the time now."
70,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,70,Edward Taylor;Reuters;Media,,ATTENDEES,Okay. I mean Bosch has started producing their own fuel cell systems. Was there a fear that basically you could miss out on a business opportunity? Is that why you are jumping on it now? Is it competitive pressure as much as anything else?
71,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,71,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"I would say, we have put as much competitive pressure on our -- on the all other players in the market. And they -- as they put pressure on us, this is the essence of our free market, and that is what has driven the industry for the last 100 years, and it will be something which will drive the industry for the next 50 years. And we have certainly -- and I would say, the success of both our brands prove that over and over that we have solved transportation challenges fairly well in the past. And therefore, both companies are pretty healthy at the moment, and I'm pretty confident that we continue that into the future."
72,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,72,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"This is a very long term firm commitment both parties are doing. And I -- and it's the same thing I've said in other areas as well. And sometimes I meant it, in this case, even Volvo. I'm never afraid of anyone in the market, but I'm never so arrogant that I don't take someone not seriously enough. That's the same thing here. I'm not afraid of any other person -- company, and I'm not too arrogant that we think we have it alone."
73,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,73,Edward Taylor;Reuters;Media,,ATTENDEES,You said it was a long-term commitment. Is there a lockup agreement? And how long is the long-term commitment?
74,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,74,Martin Daum,Head of the Daimler Trucks & Buses Divisions and Member of the Board of Management Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,Long term is really long term. Long term is beyond the two Martins in this thing can think at the moment. Yes. This is very long.
75,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,75,Operator,,,"So we received no further questions, I hand back to Florian Martens for closing remarks."
76,"AB Volvo (publ), Daimler Truck AG - Special Call",QA,76,Florian Martens,Head of Global Communications Trucks & Buses Daimler AG,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Thank you very much to the operator and everybody involved in making this call happen. And thank you very much to all of you for dialing in and engaging with these many questions. Of course, the communications teams of Volvo and Daimler Trucks remain at your disposal to further clarify your interest and questions after this call. Again, we'd like to thank you for taking the time today. Have a great day, and please stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you very much."
