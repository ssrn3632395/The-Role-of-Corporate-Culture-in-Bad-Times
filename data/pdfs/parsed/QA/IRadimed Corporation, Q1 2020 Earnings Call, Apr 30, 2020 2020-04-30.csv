0,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Scott Henry with Roth Capital.
1,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Scott Robert Henry,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A couple of questions. I guess, first, just a big picture question. I recognize you don't want to give guidance, but can you talk qualitatively about how we should think about 2Q relative to 1Q given COVID-19?"
2,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, Scott, this is Leslie. I'll maybe start off by providing a little of that qualitative context for the kind of short to medium term, and then Chris can add to my comments."
3,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"When we think about how has that returned to growth, what's it going to look like, the time frames, which just happens, are going to be uncertain. But when we think about our portfolio, it really is well positioned with its remote capabilities, MRI safety and transportability. We have a nice mix of equipment and critical care disposables. We're geographically diversified, so in different countries around the world, recover from this pandemic at different rates. We will see benefit from that and be able to participate in that."
4,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And probably finally, we believe the need to do MRIs on critical patients and those needing sedation will absolutely continue. In fact, there's accumulating evidence suggesting that patients with severe COVID-19 may be at risk for encephalopathy, which is actually causing an increase in critical care patients needing MRI exams. So these are just a few thoughts to kind of put some qualitative context around that path back to higher growth."
5,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,Scott Robert Henry,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And I guess just to kind of follow up, and I know you don't want to get too granular, but I mean, is it reasonable to think of business being down 40% to 50% in 2Q? Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude."
6,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,Scott Robert Henry,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And along that line, could you give me a sense of how your business typically performs? And if there's a recessionary environment, I would think it would be relatively defensive but curious of your take."
7,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"So Scott, I mean, I think you're hitting on a lot of the uncertainties that really caused us to withdraw our financial guidance in the beginning. And to Leslie's point, the duration that were impacted or the duration of the pandemic itself, when is the country going to reopen, how is that going to look, when are other countries going to reopen and how does that play out, I think there's a lot of the uncertainty exists around, and trying to quantify that is quite challenging at this point."
8,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Could -- to your question, could revenue be down 50%? I'm assuming you're talking about 50% from the first quarter. That would put us somewhere around, I don't know, call it, $4.3 million, $4.4 million. And I mean my sense is that's a pretty drastic move but certainly not out of the realm of possibilities. But it's challenging trying to answer your question specifically."
9,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Scott Robert Henry,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. No, Chris, that's actually really helpful. I appreciate just kind of the context behind that. And then I just want to ask, in first quarter, the monitor sales were very strong relative to expectations. I mean they were strong in Q4. Typically Q1, maybe we drop back down, but it was a really solid number, particularly given the background. But then pumps got hit a little more, which -- not totally unexpected. But can you talk a little bit about those trends between the strong monitor sales and a little more weakness in the pump sales in Q1?"
10,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"I think part of this goes back to just our international channel performed very well with both pumps and monitors. Domestically, we struggled a little bit more on the pump side than, I would say, when compared to compared to the international side. But I think part of this goes to how the hospital restrictions were rolled out."
11,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"The March -- or I would say the third month in every quarter is always the most important month for us when it comes to bookings. And for -- really, we started to see restrictions on our ability to access hospitals in mid- to late February, where those rumors were starting to float around and isolated instances of hospitals really shutting their doors to vendors. And then, of course, as we progressed throughout the month of March, that really became the norm. And it impacted our ability domestically."
12,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"So I can't -- there wasn't anything out of the ordinary related to pumps, but other than the impact from COVID and hard to put a finger on anything else other than COVID."
13,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Great. And just a final question, just -- can you just clarify? It looks like the tax gain in was not excluded from non-GAAP EPS. Is that correct?"
14,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,That's right.
15,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,Scott Robert Henry,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,It wasn't -- meaning it wasn't pulled out?
16,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,Christopher K. Scott,CFO & Secretary,EXECUTIVES,It wasn't pulled out. That's right.
17,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,The next question is from Lisa Springer with Singular Research.
18,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"During your remarks, you mentioned that COVID-related orders for IV sets. I was wondering if you could -- do you have a sense of how much of the increase in disposables was related to COVID-19 type demand?"
19,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Lisa, this is Leslie McDonnell. We're not -- we don't have a good enough sense of that to be able to break that out. We saw the biggest surge in the IV set business in what we call our extension type set. Now those are typically used in critical care environments. So I think there was definitely a positive impact from customers buying ahead as well as seeing an opportunity to use that tubing for patients who were in isolation room settings, and they wanted to control the pump from outside that room."
20,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And you also do -- in your remarks, you mentioned cost containment is one of your -- the legs of the company going into 2020. Could you give us a little more detail around what areas you might be looking at? And have you set specific goals for cost containment?"
21,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I think at this point, we're looking at a lot of things. We've taken some steps already regarding reducing hours, where possible, restricting travel, things like that. We're sort of play-booking a lot of different options. But at this point, it's too early to carry out any of those plans so soon."
22,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Okay. And do you have any sense in terms of the mix between domestic versus international going into the second quarter? Is it going to be stronger internationally again? Or do you have a sense of that?
23,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I mean, Lisa, I think that really will depend on how fast the U.S. hospitals open up to manufacturing partners coming in, in supporting them. It's -- we're seeing into that, reports of that in different places in the United States. It's kind of hard to gauge that relative to the pace of recovery in other countries. I think our international business will continue to stay strong. The comment I made before about that geographically diversified revenue base, I think it's going to play in our favor because of all that uncertainty."
24,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"At this time, there are no further questions. I'll hand the call over to Ms. McDonnell."
25,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,Leslie L. McDonnell,"President, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I would like to thank everyone for listening and participating in the call. These are unpredictable times, and we are taking steps that come out of this pandemic stronger than ever. To manage through this, we are focusing on the things in our control and being vigilant in the areas of product innovation, serving our customers, taking care of our employees and assessing the impact of COVID on our cost structure. Wishing you all continued good health, and we look forward to speaking with you again after Q2."
26,"IRadimed Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,Operator,,,Thank you. This concludes the call. You may now disconnect.
