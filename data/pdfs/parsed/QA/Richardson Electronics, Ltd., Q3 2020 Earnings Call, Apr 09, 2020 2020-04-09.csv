0,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question. It comes from the line of Marc Silk.
1,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,1,Marc Silk,Silk Investment Advisers,ANALYSTS,"Mr. Richardson, you've mentioned cash management, the capital expenditures, cash, a few times. I've seen your cash go from $60 million a few years ago down to $43.9 million. I brought this up before, and I think now with what's going on in the world, I think it makes sense that -- I think your salary is excessive. I think the right thing to do, even if you cut your salary in half, it's still a very healthy salary. And I think you got to do the right thing and show an example that you're sacrificing just like everybody else in the company."
2,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,2,Marc Silk,Silk Investment Advisers,ANALYSTS,"So I'd like to hear that comment because the last time we talked about this, you said you haven't paid yourself in a long time, but sounds to me like the last few years between that and dividends, you've been doing very well. It's very hard for me to add to my position when you're using this as a piggy bank. So I would like you to comment on that because I think other shareholders feel the same way. So thank you for taking my call, and good luck."
3,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,3,Marc Silk,Silk Investment Advisers,ANALYSTS,"Thanks, Marc. Well, we certainly appreciate your opinion. Now what we have done during this period of time, and we're doing it again is the incentives for the executive team have been cut dramatically, and that's continued. So even though as a total gross number, it looks to be quite large to you, I understand it's far less than what we've been paid in the past. So we'll take your comment under consideration."
4,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,4,Marc Silk,Silk Investment Advisers,ANALYSTS,"And on the buyback, you're going to hold off for now, correct? Because I think having cash is very important."
5,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,5,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,That is correct. We are not going to buy any more stock back at this juncture.
6,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,6,Operator,,,Your next question comes from the line of Harry Sauers.
7,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,7,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Well, first off, congratulations on a quarterly profit. I was a bit concerned for some time there, and that brings me a little bit of hope as a shareholder here as well as your continued commitment to the quarterly dividend. As you discussed with Marc, I mean, your stock is trading at these ridiculously depressed levels, but I understand that, of course, having cash is important. How do you expect that cash is going to be used in light of this situation, say, if it were to continue on for another year?"
8,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,8,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I don't think any of us really have an idea of what's going to happen with the coronavirus issue. And at this juncture, we want to take sort of a wait and see and be prepared. I think as we do better with the tube, the CT Tube manufacturing, our under absorption continues to go down and the cost, frankly, of the tube goes down, so the margins will go up. And I believe in the near term, if we get back to normal, that we'll go cash flow neutral, and that would be a wonderful situation to have. But at the moment, we're going to take a wait-and-see attitude."
9,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,9,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Definitely, as a shareholder, I agree with you. That would be a wonderful situation to see. I pulled up some statistics this morning that suggested that the average CEO of an electronics manufacturing company earns a bit over $200,000 in salary. This is from the Bureau of Labor statistics. What makes you, Mr. Richardson, worth nearly 4x that, plus performance bonuses?"
10,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,10,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, again, the amount of salary that I've taken and -- has been pretty much common now since the company has gone public years ago. As I mentioned, currently, we're taking cash incentive reductions, so I appreciate your opinion on it. It's been a fact of life with the company, and I don't see it changing in the future, even."
11,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,11,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Well, I didn't offer an opinion there. I asked what makes you worth it."
12,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,12,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"I guess, 50 years' experience in the business, which doesn't exist anywhere else in the tube business."
13,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,13,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Interesting. So regarding your Canvys business segment, what does the operating profit or loss look like?"
14,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,14,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Jens, do you want to address that?"
15,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,15,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Hello, this is Jens here. I mean I think we shared the numbers in the -- during the call, right? So we are making an operating contribution, and we are growing the business year-over-year since several years now. So I think it's a very positive business development right now."
16,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,16,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"I'm having a bit of trouble here seeing the synergy of Canvys with your other business lines of PMT and healthcare, I guess, aside from the integration of healthcare displays. And to be quite frank with you, the canvys.com website, it looks like it was made in 2003 and not updated since. Don't you think that a larger business with better business synergies and more ability to inject cash into growing Canvys might be a better fit?"
17,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,17,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"So I'll leave this up to Ed to answer, but thanks for making me aware of the website. We are actually working on our website right now and refreshing it and making it nicer and appearing more like the healthcare and the rest of the company. So I think many years back before I was hired actually -- sorry?"
18,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,18,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"I said that's a relief. Thank you, I'm glad to hear that."
19,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,19,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And many years back, there was a strategic position at Richardson before I was hired to buy several display companies and then merger them together, and I think that's paying off. So we are pretty happy with production locations in Europe, in Germany, and also on the East Coast in America, and a global supply chain that works for us. And we have other areas where we work closely together with the Richardson Healthcare team. For example, we have global certifications, we have the ISO 13485 globally, we have a quality system that is globally in place for medical devices. So we all benefit from that. I think it's a pretty good fit now."
20,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,20,Jens Ruppert,Executive VP & GM of Canvys,EXECUTIVES,Anything to you'd want to add?
21,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,21,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean we looked at that for years when the business was not profitable, and frankly, we set it up as a very independent company. So if and when it made sense for us to divest of the business, then we could do that. And fortunately, we were able to attract Jens to come to work for us a number of years ago. And with his knowledge of the medical industry and the display industry and also his hands on ability to manage people and reduce costs, he's done a fantastic job. And you listened to what the backlog is now and what the future looks like in that business, and I wish all of our businesses were doing as well as the display business that Canvys is doing. We certainly intend to have it as a critical part of our future."
22,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,22,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Well, I'm glad he's doing a good job in that regard there. I certainly don't disagree with that, right? But especially if we need cash and the needs of Canvys customers and employees might be better served by somewhere with more capital to inject into it, I guess you and I are just going to have to agree to disagree on that point."
23,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,23,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"For the time being, yes, for sure."
24,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,24,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"If you're calling certain parts of Richardson Healthcare ""noncore"", why have you not hired an investment banker to divest those parts and refocus on your core operations?"
25,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,25,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"We really aren't calling any portion of Richardson Healthcare noncore. I -- if you came with -- away with that impression, certainly it wasn't intended."
26,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,26,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Sure. That was a direct quote from this call. If it's not noncore, I can understand that, but there were parts of it that were referred to as noncore here."
27,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,27,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,Okay. I was...
28,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,28,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"Ed, Maybe I can answer that?"
29,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,29,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,All right. Fine.
30,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,30,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. That was -- I think I made the comment that the sales decline was partially due to noncore parts. And what I was referring to there, the majority of our business, as everyone knows, is focused on Canon. And in the past, we had a few other vendors and product lines in the MRI space, in the coil space, where we had some part sales, but those programs weren't particularly efficient in terms of our investments in inventory dollars. So those are the ones when we look at quarter-over-quarter comparison, we had some sales in those last year, not a lot, as I mentioned, that didn't repeat this year because we've discontinued those efforts. But our core business, being the Canon parts, the tubes, et cetera, that -- those are performing very well. So I apologize for the confusion."
31,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,31,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,All right. That's very helpful for me then. Do you anticipate any inventory write-downs due to demand falling?
32,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,32,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"The -- I would reserve that only, again, for this coronavirus issue, we have no idea what's going to happen in the next few months. But other than that, we don't see any major write-downs. We have normal reserves that are established, and they're more than enough to cover any inventory write-downs at this point."
33,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,33,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,And do those same statements apply to your accounts receivable?
34,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,34,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,Yes. We've done -- our finance team has done an excellent job in keeping the accounts receivable current and getting the collections in on time here. They really do a fantastic job.
35,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,35,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Yes. I definitely see you have very few doubtful accounts as of now, but I do understand that it's been a concern in a lot of businesses about the accounts receivable not being able to be collected on. So..."
36,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,36,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, it could happen. Again, with this coronavirus thing, people are going to say, ""Gee, we've been closed for 2 or 3 months. You can't expect us to pay on time."" But so far, we haven't seen that. But who knows what's going to happen in that area. We -- historically, that has not been a problem with the business."
37,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,37,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"And what do you attribute the CT Tube sales growth to? Because historically, the growth has been a little bit up and down. But I believe we're up 130% against this quarter over last year. Is that due to the impact of the coronavirus at all?"
38,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,38,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"No. Wendy, do you want to answer that question?"
39,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,39,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So no, it is not due to the coronavirus at this point in time. Again, it's more a factor we've been saying since we launched the ALTA750 that the growth would be linear. And so quarter-over-quarter, the trend is just that, it's going up. The slope is not as steep as everybody would like it to be. But each quarter, we've shown -- with one or two exceptions, we've shown growth in the number of tubes. In the last quarter, 120 days or so, we've gone out very aggressively, making sure that we're positioned to win every opportunity that we come across. And so that's why, I think, we're seeing some of the growth now."
40,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,40,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,Do you anticipate any demand slowing in those due to the coronavirus?
41,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,41,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Right now, we do. We're seeing a decline, again, in the number of calls, and our -- we've been talking to the third-party service companies that we partner with, and they're seeing a dramatic drop-off in their call volume. And the reason for that is because all nonessential, noncritical surgeries and procedures have all been postponed. And any equipment maintenance, any new installs, those kinds of things have also been put on hold because the hospitals don't want any disruption. They don't let visitors in their facility. So we think that's going to end up being pent-up demand when the coronavirus is under control, that we'll see the reverse of that. And you'll be able..."
42,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,42,Harry Sauers;Sauers Value Partners;Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"So in the short run, how material would that decline be?"
43,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,43,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,I don't know. I don't know. I can't really define that at this point.
44,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,44,Operator,,,We have no further questions. [Operator Instructions] We do have a further question. It comes from Eric Landry.
45,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,45,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,"So Ed and Wendy, I'd like to have a short discussion here about the healthcare segment. And Ed, you mentioned earlier in the call that you believe the healthcare strategy is solid, and you've made that now, and the business as it stands now is, I think we'd all agree, significantly less successful or solid than we had all hoped 1.5 years ago. So I'm wondering when you and Wendy and the Board would consider pivoting to more of a strategy that involves some OE manufacturing so that you can fill what to me looks like a gorgeous facility with nice modern equipment and lots of know-how inside a factory that appears to be pretty good at building tubes, yet nobody wants tubes that nobody wants to buy at this point. So if either of you could comment on whether or not there's been any thought to pivoting the strategy to something that might involve some more volume but perhaps maybe lower margins, so you could absorb some of those costs a little bit better than what I'm assuming are -- is being absorbed right now."
46,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,46,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I'll try to answer some of it. And then, Wendy, you're welcome to add your thoughts. First of all, we're well aware, for instance, on the Canon ALTA750 tube, that the tube is sold. It's made by Varex, as you know, imaging in it. It's sold to Canon for -- in the realm of $30,000 a tube or less. And quite frankly, our manufacturing cost today on the tube approaches that. So there would be -- for us to enter the OEM business and try to compete with Varex to sell the tubes to Canon would be practically no profit. And so we -- our total strategy with a company going back as long as I've been with the company is to compete with the OEMs for the aftermarket business. That's why we got into the CT manufacturing business to compete with Varex and Canon for the replacement business at a much higher-margin than is possible in the OEM business. And basically, it's a matter of cost and the market conditions that we haven't gone into OEM for that reason."
47,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,47,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Wendy, do you want to add your comments on that?"
48,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,48,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So I think we've mentioned in the past that we haven't completely ruled it out. Ed is right, it would be very difficult for us to sell to the OEMs because the pricing is so low. So it's not just a matter of saying that we would take lower margin, it's whether we could make any margin at all. Having said that, we have been talking to -- in the past 12 months, we've been talking to different companies. And so if the opportunity presents itself and it's a good one where we can help develop a new OEM solution where we can make some money doing it, I think we would consider it, Eric, and I don't think we're ruling it out."
49,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,49,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"In the interim, while we do that, and the sales team is focused on not just the OEM in the healthcare space, but similar tubes that are also used in industrial applications or security applications. So while I can't say anything is imminent, it's not that those conversations are not being held. We absolutely are looking at some of those opportunities."
50,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,50,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"Now in the interim, as we've talked about, what we will do, which kind of has the same impact, is, again, look at what are the additional tubes that serve the end user, like Ed said, where we can provide tubes in the aftermarket and we're working on, as you know, the G. And we're -- also started a new project for a different brand and a different -- 2 different tube types. And as soon as we know more and we're comfortable with the schedule, we'll start to talk a little bit more about that. But right now, I wouldn't want to put it out there until we can confirm some dates."
51,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,51,Wendy S. Diddell,COO & Executive VP of Corporate Development,EXECUTIVES,"And then finally, we're looking at other items and accessories that go hand-in-hand with those. As you know, we make the heat exchanger in the same facility. We do brush blocks. We're now looking at high- voltage multipliers. So there's other things that they're not huge quantity. It's not the OEM business, and we fully concede that, but there are other parts and products that we're looking at that can utilize the same resources and, as you said, the gorgeous facility, the new equipment that we have."
52,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,52,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Wendy, that's somewhat comforting. But Ed, I still don't think I got an answer for why you think or still think that the healthcare strategy is solid, so let me just go back. The big reason that we bought the tube. Yet when we got to the point where it was time to sell the tube, nobody wanted to buy the tube, and there were all kinds of reasons for that. I guess, the OEM is a more stringent competitor than what everybody thought and this that and the other. I'm a little bit concerned that there's a lot of hopes being pinned on the G tube being manufactured, and I'm fearful that the situation with the G tube may be similar to the situation with the D tube. So we'll have two tubes to sell, but that will just mean that few people want to buy both tubes instead of just the one tube. So I'd like to know, Ed, what it is that makes you feel more comforted that with this G tube, you will all of a sudden have a viable business here, whereas at this point, it doesn't appear to be all that viable?"
53,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,53,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Well, I think, first of all, none of us think that 1 tube or 2 tube, makes a business in the CT tube area. And as Wendy mentioned, we're going forward to look at other manufacturers' tubes as well. And over the next few years, you'll see us release a number of tubes for other manufacturers so that we're not just a 1 tube shop, if you will. But at the same time, as you well know, the former CEO, their access on our Board. And I get a kick out of listening to him talk about Varex that it took them 20 years actually to develop the ALTA tube before they could actually get it to market on a reliable basis. And he feels -- and we've spent a lot of money, obviously, but he feels we're just right around the corner from having a successful business in the aftermarket space with the -- some of the new tubes we're bringing on. And -- but it's not a 2-year business. And I apologize if we led you to believe it was a 2-year business going here, it's not. It's a 5-year business plus before we can be in a breakeven kind of position. And it's certainly not what the investment world looks for in a 2- or 3-year term."
54,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,54,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Okay. It's interesting that you mentioned a Board member, which I'm assuming is Mr. Kluge, and you said that his opinion is that brighter days are right around the corner. It would be helpful if investors could hear that from him because his actions sure don't indicate that he sees any type of a brighter future right around the corner. And I'm referring specifically to stock purchases, or in this instance, significant lack thereof, because he has been very inactive, meaning 0 purchases of stock that I can see. And it appears that he's a person of somewhat considerable means and could afford to buy the stock. So if investors could hear from his mouth that he believes that this is a very viable business in the not-so-distant future, I think that, that might override some concerns that maybe people have that this is a guy who has been on the Board for 2 years and hasn't bought one share of stock. So I guess what I would say to wrap it up is that actions speak louder than words, even given that, it would be helpful to hear it from his mouth and then maybe even to have some insider buying on his behalf would also be somewhat helpful."
55,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,55,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,"No. I understand. And you've expressed that opinion before. He will be in for the annual shareholder meeting, and we talked about this and he said he'd be happy to answer questions at that time. So I can't answer the question for him."
56,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,56,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That'd be great. I tried to talk to him at the last meeting, and he left early, so I didn't get a chance."
57,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,57,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,"Last thing, I just want to make clear that both Jens and Greg, I guess, and Wendy, everybody is expecting material pushouts this quarter because of the virus, correct?"
58,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,58,Eric Landry,"BML Capital Management, LLC",ANALYSTS,I think we don't know what to expect. I think that's the answer.
59,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,59,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And the semiconductor business, is that -- does that appear to be affected as heavily as the other stuff?"
60,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,60,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"No. They're also considered a essential business. And as a matter of fact, we're on a conference call with them tomorrow where they're going to give us an update. They're really concerned that they have to make deliveries on products and want to make sure that we're up to speed and can handle their requirements. So they're putting all their major vendors on conference calls to tell them what we need to do to fill their requirements, and we listen there. In these times, they're our biggest customer, that's for sure. That industry is our biggest customer."
61,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,61,Operator,,,"Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt. We are running out of time, so now I would like to turn the call back to Ed for closing statements."
62,"Richardson Electronics, Ltd., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,62,Edward J. Richardson,"CEO, COO, President & Chairman",EXECUTIVES,"All right. Yes, thanks, Leslie. Well, thanks to all of you for joining us and for your ongoing interest in Richardson Electronics.
