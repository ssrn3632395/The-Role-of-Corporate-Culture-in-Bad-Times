0,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.
1,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,1,Christopher Robert Growe,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Glad to hear you guys are healthy and hope it stays that way. I just thought I would ask you, first of all, as we think about this very loyal consumer base you have, just want to get a sense from you, Joe, if you can speak to it, I know it's very early, but how those kind of -- those consumers react in this environment."
2,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,2,Christopher Robert Growe,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then I'm just curious how you get a sense of that. Is it through e-commerce trends? Sounds like those were strong through March. I'd say that's probably ticking up a bit. You've seen more activities through your website. Is there panel data? Just to get a sense of how these consumers are reacting now, if you have any sense of that and then how you're going to track that."
3,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,3,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Chris, good question. Again, very early, early stages of this. And I think right now, the big driver of this has been shopping behavior influence more than it's consumption behavior influence. So we have a pretty good view of what's going on from a shopping standpoint."
4,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,4,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And as we said in our prepared comments, that March was really volatile. Through the early portion of March up to the weekend of the 20, 21st, we saw a significant spike in foot traffic and a significant uptick in our business in both our business as well as the category. The weekend of the 20th and 21st appear to be an inflection point in people's shopping behaviors, a dramatic falloff, double-digit falloff that has remained through -- that remained through the end of the month, and people's shopping patterns and going into stores."
5,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,5,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We saw significant channel shifting. So e-commerce, online, pickup and delivery all accelerated. And then brick-and-mortar saw a significant falloff that's kind of remained until now. So most of it right now, I'd say, Chris, is shopping behavior driven more than it's consumption driven. And right now, we don't have a really good read on how the confinement is influencing how people consume the product."
6,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,6,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I can give you my anecdotal experience. It's your home, the pantry is pretty close and I'm snacking more frequently. So I think from a snacking behavior, our category will do well once we get over some of the shopping behavior issues. I think obviously, the on-the-go aspect of this category is going to be a negative drag for us, offset somewhat by the snacking behavior increases."
7,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,7,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,But really early innings at this point. We don't know a whole lot about consumption behavior. And our view of how we are thinking about guidance had much to do with uncertainty around shopping behavior and the decisions people are making when they go in the store.
8,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,8,Christopher Robert Growe,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And presumably, in any given period, there are volatile weeks and it's obviously very unique, no question. I've heard anecdotally as well, you've seen a pickup in sales in early April here, SNAP benefits. And again, there's another reload, if you will, of pantry loading. So has that picked up a bit? Have you seen that of late in most recent days and the week or any sense of that yet?"
9,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,9,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Last few days have been much better than the previous 2 weeks, yes."
10,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,10,Christopher Robert Growe,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's what I assume. It's going to be jumping around, yes."
11,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,11,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And that's -- I think that was, in part, one of the reasons that we suspended guidance. Just the sheer level of volatility of what people are doing. I'd also add, I've been into a fair number of stores just watching shopping behavior. And actually, in the stores, the behavior is really interesting. So people are moving into the stores, quickly doing their shopping and for the most part, staying in center of store."
12,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,12,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So shopping, shelf stable, I would say, basic staples and getting out of the store pretty quickly. So one of the behaviors we noticed early in this is, even when people are shopping, they're avoiding the perimeter, not always getting into the health and beauty section where a predominant number of our products are. And that had some impact to foot traffic in the aisle and then obviously, purchase behavior impact."
13,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,13,Christopher Robert Growe,"Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Well, let's hope they go online to buy that -- the items they miss when they go through that section. So I appreciate your color there and I'll leave it on for the next question."
14,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,14,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.
15,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,15,Robert Frederick Dickerson,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Those were all good questions by Mr. Growe. I guess it seems like what you're implying, obviously, or what you're saying is there's a ton of volatility. We all understand that. Just -- I've had a number of people asking me this morning. If Q2 came in so well though, right, I mean you came in with above 12% organic sales growth, and that's to the end of February and you also had 12% in the first half, then the first half at 12%, the guidance was still kind of high end to 4% to 6%. Obviously, everything has changed since then."
16,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,16,Robert Frederick Dickerson,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"You put in -- you said in a statement though that tracking to still hit that guidance. Even though there's volatility in the back half, we don't really know what's going to happen in the back half. But at the same time, just to try to find -- keep it positive here. In Q2, if you put up 12%, I know there was a lot of concern, probably in the shake business, coming out of the February data trends, your quarterly growth through February. So there's no COVID prebuying impact, let's say, outside of the inventory build."
17,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,17,Robert Frederick Dickerson,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Net-net, it seems like that business actually did better on the bar side than you would have thought because the narrative kind of coming into today and through February was -- would seem like they're doing worse in shake. So there's more competition in shake. So we worry about shakes, what about shake, but you actually blew away expectations in the quarter, which would make me think that you actually were way ahead of expectations on bars. So I just -- as we think about the kind of the base business, right, at COVID, ex near-term behavior shift, can you just speak to that bar business and the shake business in Q2 pre-COVID?"
18,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,18,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Rob. We felt -- as I said in the prepared comments, we felt very good about where we were through the midyear, obviously, pre COVID-19. Our -- both of our brands were at or exceeding expectations through the first half of the year. And we felt we were well positioned and very confident in our ability to deliver the year. So I think that's clear cut. So our decision going forward was much more to do about consumer shopping behavior over the month of March and the unpredictability of projecting that behavior going forward."
19,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,19,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I would also add that the decision to suspend guidance was a more strategic decision and not just about the uncertainty and the magnitude of the duration of consumer shopping behavior, although that clearly was an important factor. It also reflected our current priorities, namely to protect our employees and our communities, ensure the robustness of our supply chain and provide service to our customers and consumers."
20,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,20,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So for us, it was much more about doing the right thing for our business over these challenging times than it was just about the POS. But again, to reiterate, we felt really good about where we were. We felt very confident pre COVID-19 that we were going to be able to achieve our financial guidance."
21,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,21,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And we felt good about the composition of our business. As you had mentioned, it had been driven through the first half of the year by strong bar and confection business. We had an RTD business that, for the first half of the year, was down a little bit. We felt good about the plans we had put into place in the second half of the year to get that moving into positive digits. And all in all, prior to the confinement, the consumer confinement, we're really confident that we have momentum on our side and we would close the second half of the year strongly."
22,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,22,Robert Frederick Dickerson,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, great. And then just one follow-up. Obviously, given everything that's occurring within consumer behavior and what you were saying about the perimeter of the store relative to the center of the store, as that relates to the marketing plans, promotional plans, how quickly do you think those plans could actually shift, their capital allocation could shift? Like I'm asking more about positioning online, right? It seems like good protein, shelf-stable products."
23,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,23,Robert Frederick Dickerson,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"If you have the right placement, let's say online like on an Amazon, you could shift that very quickly relative to be shifting your product placement within the store. Is there ability to shift promotional spend or rather marketing spend or product placement spend on the page upfront to try to actually further increase and grow that online business given the current dynamic? That's it."
24,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,24,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So Rob, excellent question, already underway. So we've obviously seen, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, our e-commerce business, the post COVID-19 has accelerated as is other online delivery and pickup. So people are -- the best they can trying to avoid going in the stores and choosing other means of buying products. So we've seen that significant pickup in our business at other channels. That has led us to shift marketing spend already to promote our brands in those channels in order to keep some marketing pressure on the business. So good question."
25,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,25,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.
26,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,26,Alexia Jane Burland Howard,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. Can I ask about the supply chain? And I noticed that you're using co-manufacturing for all of your supply. How much flexibility is there to ramp up production in those facilities? And also, how dedicated are the plants? I mean if one of them goes off-line because of COVID-19, could other plants pick up that capacity? I'm thinking about both bars and shakes. How much could you increase production on a steady state over the next few months while restaurant traffic is down?"
27,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,27,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Good question, Alexia. First, the -- we've been in constant communication not only with our contract manufacturers, but communication upstream with our ingredient suppliers. Their situation -- they are well prepared for this. We've been in communication for over 5 weeks with these suppliers to understand what their plans are coming into the situation. And we're very confident in the robustness of our co-man, our third-party logistics provider and our ingredient suppliers."
28,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,28,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And so far, there have been no impacts in their facilities, in production and our ability to meet demand. We are in the early stages of this stepped-up inventory on key SKUs. So we typically are running about, call it, 5 to 6 weeks of inventory in our own warehouses for key SKUs, about 35 of our top SKUs."
29,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,29,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"We started moving our inventory position closer to 8 weeks, and we'll be continuing to monitor that and continue to move that up. In some instances, we'll go to 10 weeks of inventory just to give ourselves some safety stock in the event of a spike in demand from a retail standpoint. We're able to get that because we've been in communication very early on in the process. We're able to get that available capacity pretty easily."
30,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,30,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Again, I have complete confidence in their preparedness, in the robustness of the supply chain and our ability to flow goods, ingredients to co-man, to our third-party warehouse and to customers smoothly. So it's been our top priority. We're on it very early. And so far, our supply chain has responded wonderfully to the situation."
31,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,31,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,Great. And can I follow up with a question on promotional activity? I think you alluded to the idea that you might be pulling back on that going forward. When might that kick in? And do you anticipate an increase in realized pricing as a result over the next few months?
32,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,32,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, terrific question. These are -- this is less about us pulling back. It's more about retailers changing their priorities. So as you can imagine, they're dealing with operational issues in their stores to keep the stores stocked and trying to keep social distancing, so the number of employees in the stores while consumers are shopping."
33,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,33,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"You're seeing those behaviors, a number of retailers announced the number of people that could be in the store at any one time. Some retailers are actually having traffic patterns in the store in order to minimize interaction between their employees and other shoppers."
34,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,34,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So the retail operational impact of the situation is for some retailers to prioritize that over promotions and even shelf resets. So I would say it's too early for us to understand the impact of that. I think it's reasonable to believe some retailers will delay shelf reset, some retailers will push out promotion events to focus on in stock shelf and safety and security of shoppers."
35,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,35,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,Hard for us to know that. I do think it's reasonable to believe we are not going to be -- we probably aren't going to spend most of our trade spend that we had originally planned simply because customers will pull back events and then -- and those monies will go unused.
36,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,36,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
37,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,37,Jason M. English,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Sorry. I think in the response to last question, Joe was talking about taking inventory from $5 million to $6 million up to somewhere in the $8 million to $10 million range. It sounds like that could have a bit of an impact on cash balance just given the working capital needs. In that context, where do you think you'll land at net debt by the end of fiscal '20?"
38,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,38,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So that impact in the short term probably has about a $10 million to $15 million cash flow impact. I'd like to think by the end of the fiscal year, we can wind a good chunk of that down. But obviously, it depends on how the COVID situation plays out over the next few months. Not a big impact on our goal of 3.75 or less on the leverage. Still confident we will be below that target as of now."
39,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,39,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We obviously have some levers to pull from a cash flow perspective on -- Joe just mentioned trade. Obviously, with no travel going on, we'll have some G&A savings here in the back half of the year. So feel much more comfortable trying to predict cash flow and to some extent, EBITDA than sales just given what's going on in the marketplace right now, but very confident on the leverage."
40,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,40,Jason M. English,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So -- and that's kind of what I was going to back into. I was trying to reverse engineer effectively where you're still expecting EBITDA to be. And it sounds like your EBITDA expectations aren't changing materially, it's just the sales volatility. So in that context, I imagine you've mapped out sort of bull, bear base type scenarios or worst case, best case type scenarios and the various offsets that would allow you to manage cash and EBITDA in each. Do you feel like you've adequately stress-tested on both ends of the range? And do you feel confident in the leverage ratio on either end?"
41,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,41,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We do. Obviously, whether this thing is going to last 3 months or longer, hard to tell. Hopefully, it's not -- hopefully, it will be even shorter than that. But we have -- we are in the process of doing a lot of stress tests right now. Again, we do have some levers to pull on the cost side. We'll be smart both from a short- term and a long-term perspective on those cost levers, but we should be very good on leverage."
42,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,42,Jason M. English,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then the last question just on -- okay, go ahead. Sorry."
43,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,43,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, Jason, one other point. As you think about consumers sheltering at home and the influence of marketing pressure, you really start challenging how much marketing dollars you should be spending and how truly effective they are. So we'll be looking at our marketing investment levels. I totally expect us to see a falloff in return on investment."
44,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,44,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And I would expect us to pull back on marketing, actually keeping some powder dry from when people seeing we're not getting a return for that spending. We're going to pull back. We'll keep our powder dry, and that provides us even more financial flexibility going forward."
45,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,45,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But I think you accurately reflected our sentiment. A lot of volatility on shopping, which drives some volatility on revenue, but we have a fair amount of dry powder from an EBITDA standpoint."
46,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,46,Jason M. English,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And as you mentioned, as people shelter at home, marketing may be less responsive. Behavior may also be different, too. Can you remind us what percentage of your consumption occasions you believe fall in the meal replacement versus snacks?"
47,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,47,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I don't think we accurately know that because we don't have that data. I don't completely understand how much is meal replacement versus snacking. There is a fair portion of our business that's snacking only. And so I think we're going to see, again, as I mentioned, an increase in snacking behavior and probably fewer occasions on meal replacement."
48,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,48,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The other thing to think through, which is -- I think is really important is the consumer benefit that we offer in our brands, weight management and active nutrition, probably a little less relevant from a consumer standpoint during times of confinement. That said, I think healthy snacking will continue to be relevant to folks as they're in their homes. But I think the weight management benefit and kind of active nutrition when we just -- those are less relevant to us. That has some impact on consumption going forward."
49,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,49,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"That said, look, we're really confident in our business after we emerge out of this. We're going to make the right decisions in the short term for our business, for our employees and for our communities. And then we feel really confident in our ability once this crisis ends and our business will be right back on track."
50,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,50,Operator,,,Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.
51,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,51,John Joseph Baumgartner,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I guess, first off, Joe, looking at the Quest business, obviously, the specialty channel has been weak already. And now with the store closures, that number falls harder as you alluded. What are you seeing in terms of the pickup in e-commerce maybe being able to offset those declines? Any data you can share thus far about any channel shift?"
52,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,52,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,Yes. Just on Quest or the entire company?
53,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,53,John Joseph Baumgartner,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Quest.
54,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,54,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Quest. As you just step back, this has been going on for a number of years. Quest's growth in food, drug, mass and then online has more than offset the declines in the specialty channel. I think with this crisis, specialty channel will accelerate."
55,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,55,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"The good news there is, for us, is that it's, as a percent of our total business, declined pretty significantly versus the last few years. So we're reasonably comfortable that channel shifting is going to continue. This may accelerate a little bit. But we're in a good position in those other channels to pick up those fast."
56,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,56,John Joseph Baumgartner,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay, great. And then to follow up, one of the pushbacks that we get on the investment case for Simple is a degree of uncertainty as to how long the Atkins brand can grow, how long the Rob Lowe messaging can work. But when you look at COVID and you hear about the more severe cases being associated with obesity, diabetes, it would seem to reinforce the low-sugar, low-carb messaging."
57,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,57,John Joseph Baumgartner,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And as you referenced the R&D pipeline in your comments, I'm curious, as you sit back, do you think COVID opens new opportunities where you expand the low-carb portfolio into new categories? Do you have any household panel data or any anecdotes about health scares being positive for low-carb demand? Just how are you thinking about things on the other side of COVID from a demand perspective maybe?"
58,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,58,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Great question. And the one observation, the low-carb diet -- high-protein, low-carb diet is beneficial from a stress standpoint, beneficial from an immunity standpoint. So I think people that -- I think all those things that have been driving our business from a megatrend standpoint around health and wellness, obesity, diabetes will continue to be relevant and in times when people are concerned about their health will continue to be relevant. So we feel really good about how our brands are positioned from a health and wellness standpoint."
59,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,59,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For those that kind of push back on how long can we grow this business, I'd just point out that it's been 11 years now, compound annual growth rate of 13% on Atkins. The category is still massively underpenetrated, a lot of opportunity, a lot of white space from a consumer target standpoint. So we're, again, really confident that the megatrends, once we come out of this crisis, will continue, and our ability to continue to capture those consumers open to low-carb and protein-rich will continue to be there for us."
60,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,60,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"And it's backed by science. It is a trend that's continued for a lot of years, and we're reasonably comfortable in our ability to continue to grow household penetration. And frankly, this will just teach us that health and wellness is important to us. Good immunity is important to us, so -- to people, and that's going to continue to be beneficial."
61,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,61,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
62,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,62,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So I just wanted to -- you touched on this a little bit during the call, but I wanted to talk more about what you're seeing from various category point of view. We don't have full March data at this point, and we kind of saw the uptake across the board through data that we do have through March 21."
63,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,63,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about which categories are you seeing the most volatility versus the most slowdowns. And then which categories do you think are most easily transferable to e-commerce?
64,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,64,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So I understand, what -- when you talk about categories, what are you referring to? Are you referring to..."
65,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,65,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. I just mean sort of shakes, bars."
66,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,66,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,Forms? Okay.
67,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,67,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, yes, yes."
68,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,68,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Okay. Yes. The reason I asked that is we don't consider those categories, right? There are -- we look at the category organization around consumer need state. So broadly, we think about it as nutritious snacking, sports, active, performance and kind of weight management. Those are the 3 segments that we see. As we move -- as shopping behavior after the 20th and 21st declined kind of double digits, the category broadly moved with the foot traffic. So that's what we experienced after the 20, 21st."
69,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,69,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Within those segments of the category, the category segments that are in the health and beauty aisle, namely sports and active and weight management, saw more falloff than nutritious snacking, which is in center of store. But we believe that -- again, that category, center of store, that's where Kind, that's where Clif is, right, they were in the center of the shopping area with shoppers coming in, getting in the center of store and getting out of the store whereas pharmacy, HABA, we saw just less foot traffic."
70,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,70,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I think that's the phenomenon that's going on, at least was going on towards the end of March as we moved into April. Really, purchasing behaviors driven by shopping behavior. And the reason we're pretty confident that, that is the case, if you look at both of our e-commerce businesses, spiked and has stayed strong since the crisis started. So we saw a significant uptick in our Quest business."
71,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,71,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"By the way, Amazon is its largest customer, 15% of their business comes from Amazon. They saw a significant spike in the business on Amazon across all their products and it's continued to be strong. And again, on top of kind of 60% growth on our Atkins business, on online, we spiked above that after the restrictions started to take place."
72,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,72,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So again, strong growth in the business where shopping is clearly not the issue, right? So I think right now, we're seeing purchase -- less about the form, almost less about the consumer benefit, much more about where it is in the store and how people are shopping."
73,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,73,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And online -- yes, online, our business is strong across the board. So every form, including shake, we are seeing significant growth. So not impacted by form."
74,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,74,Faiza Alwy,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. Just one quick follow-up. Just going back to the supply chain. I know historically, you've talked about how you're kind of -- as you talk to your co-packers, you're kind of putting in certain orders relative to where you expect sales will be. And to the extent that you diverge from that, there can be incremental costs associated with that. Sort of is there any framing that you can give us where, I don't know, sales are up x percent like that might have -- what the cost impact of that might be?"
75,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,75,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So far, we've not seen a cost impact. We're very early in the stages. Just to give you an example, we went few days after that. So we're early on this. We're early in communicating with our suppliers, and we were early in increasing orders on key items. So we grabbed a lot of available capacity early in the process, not with really a significant -- no significant uptick in costs."
76,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,76,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,We've seen a little bit of extra cost in our warehouse operations mainly driven by making sure that our -- the employees in those operations continue to come to work. There's a lot of pressure in the area for other distribution companies looking to try to get employees to come into their places. So we've been paying bonuses that have been helpful in us making sure that we have the employees necessary to get products out the door.
77,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,77,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"But Todd, do you have any other comments? We have not experienced any uptick at all in cost of goods."
78,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,78,Todd E. Cunfer,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, very nominal at this point. Look, as we pointed out on the call, we are looking at this very strategically. If we have to pay a little bit more in the future to make sure we have products in our warehouse and our customer shelves, we're more than willing to do that. We have not seen that yet. So hopefully, that will not be traded over the next couple of months. But so far, very, very little."
79,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,79,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I would remind you, too, a year ago, we saw a pretty significant uptick in bar demand. We were able to get that extra supply. We really didn't have any increase in cost in order to get that extra supply. So the good news are that we're a big manufacturer, right? We have large volume and we offer a long run when a contract manufacturer makes our product. So we're somebody that they will actually want to have more business with. So if we're getting our demands in, our requirements in pretty early, they're happy to meet those needs if they've got surplus capacity. And so far, that capacity is available."
80,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,80,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Joe Scalzo for closing comments."
81,"The Simply Good Foods Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2020",QA,81,Joseph E. Scalzo,"CEO, President & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Thanks again for your participation on our call today. We hope you'll continue to remain safe, and we look forward to updating you on our third quarter results in July. So I hope you all have a good day. Take care."
