0,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
1,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Vincent Stephen Andrews,,,"Maybe I could just ask about how you're thinking about in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. If you look at the price decline that you guided to for 2Q, could you just talk about how much of that is coming out of -- do you think it's going to come out of the U.S. market versus it's just the weak export market or the EU? And how are you thinking about ethane and propane through the quarter? There's been some volatility in ethane over the last months, and propane seems to be pretty -- being pretty stubborn relative to the move in crude so far."
2,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Vince, everybody is doing great here, and thanks for asking. We hope you are, too. Most of the pricing -- and I think what you're saying on pricing is that you're seeing things kind of come to a global kind of a price right now and that you would expect that with what's happened. I think you're going to see a little bit more come out in Europe than in North America. A little bit less in Latin America, a little bit less in the Pacific. Actually, we've started to see exports to China stepping up pretty dramatically. China has reduced the tariffs coming in. And the Chinese economy is starting to rebound versus March. I would say we start to see activity there in late March and through the month of April, so the industrial part of the economy is starting to get rolling again. Consumer part, still a little bit uneven. And then obviously, we did what we did on supply just to balance off demand."
3,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"So we had a good strong first quarter. Volumes were flat, slightly up in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, but we're going to see some impact on volumes in the industrial part of the sector in the second quarter, which is why we tightened up some of the supply. And that was primarily due to industrial shipping, industrial applications, automotive applications. We're starting to see the automotive industry talk about coming back here in the month of May and also in the month of May in Europe. So hopefully, we'll see the May, June turn in the economy on the industrial side here in North America, Latin America."
4,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,Operator,,,"And next, we'll move to John Roberts with UBS."
5,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,John Ezekiel E. Roberts,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Can you comment on other industry closures you might be seeing? We don't usually think of Dow as high cost, although ethane has kind of slipped here currently. But are we seeing other closures we haven't heard about yet from competitors in the marketplace?"
6,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, John, thanks for the question. We're not closing high-cost assets. We're closing to balance demand. So look, all of these are reasonable cost assets, but the reality is there's been a pretty significant amount of industrial capacity shutdown on the downstream. And so we don't feel like, in this environment, really plowing a lot of material into inventory is the right thing to do. So that's why we're dialing back the capacity."
7,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"I have seen some delays and indefinite suspensions of projects. There was one this week in Ohio, the Thai project that was going to go ahead. So we're starting to see some of those kinds of announcements. We're seeing reduced rates across polyurethanes across the globe, basically, and we've got polyurethanes"
8,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"MDI capacity down in China right now, not us, but competitors do, really to balance out the fact that downstream automotive and appliances and construction for insulation materials has been slow. So I think that's what you're seeing. I think it has less to do with the cost position and more to do with supply/ demand."
9,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Operator,,,And David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have our next question.
10,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,David L. Begleiter,,,"On the same point, the idling of the Americas ethylene, polyethylene plants, is your decision being influenced at all by the cost competitiveness of these plants given the recent drop in oil prices? And if not, are you concerned about losing any share to competitors who are not being as disciplined as you are?"
11,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"CEO & Chairman across our plastics business. And ethylene costs are still very low in the U.S. Gulf Coast, so we haven't idled anything on the ethylene side. In fact, right now, probably 9% to 10% of ethylene production capacity is out on the U.S. Gulf Coast. So we'll balance that out."
12,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"We've been operating very well from a working capital standpoint. And I think what we're trying to do here is just make sure that we don't plow a lot of material into inventory until we see a good demand signal coming on the back end. We're starting to get good signs. We're starting to get positive signs out of many states in the United States for a May opening and some parts of Europe, like Germany, Austria, Switzerland. And then I think as confidence builds, testing comes along, people are going to be more certain about going back into manufacturing, and consumers will be back in the market. And at that point, it's easy to fire these polyethylene units back up and meet that demand."
13,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,Operator,,,"And next, we'll move to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein."
14,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Jonas I. Oxgaard,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"A follow-up on the previous question there. The 5% to 10% lower ethylene, that seems to be higher than the industry average. How much of that is refilling your own inventory from TX-9? And maybe a sort of a hypothetical, if TX-9 had not been down, do you think you would have been forced to reduce rates more in line with industry average?"
15,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Thanks, Jonas, for the question. Texas-9 is back up, so it's at the $2 million run rate right now. Most of that expansion on Texas-9 was for MEGlobal for their consumption for MEG. And so they've been buying ethylene in the market to really get themselves started up and running, so this supplies them in the marketplace. And I haven't seen any reduction in volumes there."
16,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"I think the other thing that's happening is, as you've seen the automotive industry go down, people that are cracking naphtha or cracking heavier don't have much place for some of the aromatics and some of the off-grades to go. And so the rubber industry has been slow. Automotive industry has been slow. So that has brought rates down in some other crackers, and then you've had some more turnaround and outage in other crackers. So as we go into the quarter, we feel like the toughest quarter here is going to be Q2. And so we want to make sure that we balance supply and demand through Q2 and position ourselves to be able to turn things back on and come up as the industry starts to come back."
17,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Operator,,,And we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
18,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"What's your cash tax rate? Is it between 30% and 35%? Or is it lower or higher? And in the United States, how will your feedstock slate in producing ethylene change versus 2019? In 2019, what were your rough percentages of ethane, propane and naphtha? And what do you think they'll be this year?"
19,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Let me get Howard to cover the tax rate, while I have to do some CEO math on your cracking question."
20,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"All right. I'll wait for you to do CEO math. Hey, Jeff, so look, the tax rate -- the P&L tax rate that we published this morning for Q2 and for the full year is between 30% and 35%, slightly higher than what we had guided to earlier and really 3 issues: lower equity earnings, different yield mix of earnings and then some discrete items. But I would say, on your question on cash tax, it's lower than that rate. I would guide you to something in the mid-20s."
21,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And to your question on cracking, Jeff, and I'll just focus on U.S. Gulf Coast here because that's where the bulk of the flexibility is. Yes, I'd say we were in the 75%, 80% ethane cracking through the year. The balance would be propane and butane and very little talk for the back half of the year. It's 0 on naphtha. Naphtha has come down, but honestly, ethane is still the best crack. And so if ethane gets tight and we start to see prices rise and propane comes into the slate, we'll swing over to our propane flex. And as you know, we can swing 70% of the capacity over to propane. So we've got that flexibility built into what we're modeling. And I'm optimistic that this is a more resilient gas market than people are estimating."
22,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,And we'll move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
23,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Hassan Ijaz Ahmed,Alembic Global Advisors,ANALYSTS,"Just wanted to sort of continue with this theme of the feedstock side of things. Let's just assume for a second that the feedstock environment that we are in right now is the new normal in terms of roughly where crude oil pricing is, this assertion that in this lower crude oil pricing environment, obviously, you'll see curtailments and cuts on the shale side of things. Maybe ethane isn't as advantaged as it used to be. So now sort of beyond the extreme near term, if that is the feedstock cost environment, how do you see the second wave of cracker and derivative sort of units play out?"
24,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,Hassan Ijaz Ahmed,Alembic Global Advisors,ANALYSTS,"I mean, in theory, the CTO/MTO side will not look that competitive, maybe naphtha looks a bit more competitive. Certainly, whoever has flexibility will be better off than those that don't. And then you have this whole sort of notion of a lot of capacity in theory coming online eventually in China. A lot of the facilities here in the U.S. just being pure ethane-based facilities. I mean how do you see those -- all of those sort of different factors playing out if feedstocks continue to act the way they have over the last couple of months?"
25,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks, Hassan. That's a lot in that question. But I would say right now, if things continued where they are today, we'd say there's about 21 million metric tons, about 11% of C2 capacity that's at risk. That's either due to age or the scale or the high conversion cost or their feedstock cracking capability. I think one of the assumptions that everybody made with naphtha coming down was that the whole world was going to switch to naphtha cracking. But what people forget is that you make so many byproducts on naphtha, and there's no home for those byproducts. So those byproduct credits go away. At the end of the day, ethane and propane still remain the most competitive crack, and we think that's going to continue."
26,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"The other assumption that goes into this then is what happens to oil price, and oil has responded to just an unbelievable slowdown in demand, which is primarily because we told everybody to stay at home and nobody is traveling. But what we're seeing in China is people are going back. Traffic rates in China for car traffic and truck traffic are back up to 80% of what they were pre-COVID. And I think when people come back here, they're going to come back into their cars. That's going to tighten up the demand side or the demand side on oil. At the same time, some of these supply adjustments are going to come back in."
27,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,27,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"So I'm not predicting that we're going to go to this is the oil demand for the rest of the future. I think if you look over a long, long time, that oil demand growth tracks population and what's going on around the world with the development of the economy. We'll get back to that. The question for everybody is just, what's the time frame? Are people going to -- if we get a test and we get a treatment, are people going to get optimistic and go back faster? Or is this going to take longer than people think?"
28,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,28,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And Hassan, on your CTO/MTO question, I would say about $6.5 million of that $21 million is CTO/MTO, which with oil below $50, that's -- those are really stressed assets."
29,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,29,Operator,,,And we'll move on to PJ Juvekar with Citi.
30,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,30,Prashant N. Juvekar,,,Just a quick question again on these co-products. You mentioned that there is no demand for co-products and prices are coming down. How would that change naphtha margins? And then can you compare current today's ethylene margins in U.S. versus Europe? You're in a good position to do that. And any thoughts on new China ethylene crackers that were coming online?
31,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,31,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"I think what we've seen so far, PJ, in terms of the cost curves on ethylene is that naphtha has come down, but lighter cracking ethane, propane cracking is still advantaged to $100 or maybe more than $100 a ton. And so that is a byproduct of the byproduct credits. And when you run these naphtha crackers, typically, market and net that back against the ethylene capacity. When there is no margin on the byproducts, there's no netback credits. And so that's what we're looking at is there's no place for the C4s to go, the butadiene demand is down, rubber demand is down. And so at some point, you flip those markets upside down. And at that point, people just slow down rather than crack more naphtha. So that's what we're looking at, and I think that's what we're going to see play out."
32,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,32,Operator,,,And we'll move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
33,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,33,John Patrick McNulty,BMO Capital Markets Equity Research,ANALYSTS,"On the cost side, can you speak to the $350 million cost asset that you're looking to pull out? How quickly that can be phased in? And then I guess also, in terms of the cost and efficiency improvements that you're looking for in Sadara, how can we be thinking about that playing through throughout the year as well and if that may be expedited in any way?"
34,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,34,John Patrick McNulty,BMO Capital Markets Equity Research,ANALYSTS,Yes. Let's -- Howard can put a good time frame to that.
35,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,35,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Yes, John, on the $350 million, I would say, I would look at about 20% of that realized in the second quarter. And then the 80%, pretty evenly split between the third quarter and fourth quarter, maybe a little bit of a lighter third quarter and a heavier fourth quarter just as we continue to take those costs out."
36,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,36,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Relative to Sadara, look, if these naphtha margins hold, you'll actually see a margin expansion in Sadara as the second quarter progresses. And then on the cost out, the team continues to do a good job of reducing costs pretty evenly through the year. In fact, if you looked at our equity earnings in the first quarter, it was the one JV that actually was flat or up on same quarter last year or prior quarter basis, and that's really because they saw the same thing that all of the other JVs saw, which was some margin compression because of the demand disruption, but they were able to offset that with the cost."
37,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,37,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The other thing that they're also working on is just the sell up. Remember, we brought 26 unit operations on pretty much in about a 12-month period. So we sold them out, but now we've got to sell them up. And so the teams are working on that. That's not going to be a 1- or 2-quarter activity, but that's over the course of about 3 or 4 years."
38,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,38,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,And we'll move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.
39,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,39,Frank Joseph Mitsch,"Fermium Research, LLC",ANALYSTS,"And Jim, I'd like to echo your appreciation and congrats to Neal and offer a warm welcome to Colleen. So Dow has spoken in the past about multiple Monte Carlo simulations, and I'm not sure if you factored in a pandemic or oil collapse in those simulations. But here we are, if I'm looking at the first half of 2020, we're running at a run rate below $6 billion in EBITDA. So I guess my question is, at what level decline in profitability do you start to get concerned about the dividend? And if you could offer any comments regarding that, that would be very helpful."
40,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,40,Frank Joseph Mitsch,"Fermium Research, LLC",ANALYSTS,Sure. Let me have Howard do that because he went through a tremendous amount of this work pre-spin as we came out of spin. Howard?
41,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,41,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Frank. Look, we're really smart. I don't know that we factored in a pandemic into the Monte Carlo simulation. So let me use the current most bearish Wall Street number that's out there on our 2020 earnings, around $5.1 billion, $5.2 billion of EBITDA. If you take out interest and taxes, that leaves you with about $4 billion. And then from there, you've got a $2.1 billion dividend. You've got what we said today was $1.25 billion of CapEx and $500 million of Sadara. So you've got plenty of room even at that bearish number to do it just with operating earnings and more than cover the dividend."
42,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,42,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We're also working on the nonoperating side of the house. So part of our cash flow in the first quarter was the $250 million that we got from the Nova judgment on the tax side. Obviously, if earnings are that kind of depressed and oil is down, we're going to see at least a $500 million release in cash on working capital. And then we've got some of the other nonoperating things that we're working on, which is the Olin payment that's expected and contractually obligated at the end of the year of about $500 million. So even at that level, we are more than comfortable and adequately able to cover that dividend. And we've got $12 billion of committed liquidity, including $3.6 billion of cash on hand."
43,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,43,Operator,,,And we'll move on to Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.
44,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,44,Christopher S. Parkinson,"Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Can you just walk us through your various Sadara assumptions just regarding the structural op improvements you referenced and just also update us on your debt re-profiling discussions?
45,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,45,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. Howard, do you want to hit Sadara, all of our assumptions and our debt re-profiling?"
46,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,46,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So look, I mean what we said in the prepared remarks this morning, we're very pleased that Sadara got that last remaining rail agreement, logistics agreement signed. That is the final substantive step to achieve PCD. Now we have a series of what I would call administrative steps that Sadara has got to work through, things like registration of their security documents for the lenders, verification of the project costs and some of those other things. Those should be well underway as we approach the end of the second quarter, if not completely done."
47,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,47,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"As a result of the logistics agreement being done, the Sadara, Saudi Aramco and Dow treasury teams have jointly begun the lender re-profiling discussions. In fact, those discussions got actively started this week. I would say for modeling purposes, it's going to take the balance of the year to make that happen. You've got ECAs in the mix, you've got sukuk financing and you've got international banks. So it's going to be a complicated discussion. That's why we say, look, $500 million of cash this year, in line with last year, makes sense from a modeling purpose standpoint. But we're pretty focused on making sure that we get that done by the end of the year. That is the goal."
48,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,48,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And if you see, Chris, Sadara's first quarter results were relatively flat with last year. We're taking lots of actions, Sadara and Aramco and Dow, to make sure that they can continue to deliver performance similar to last year. And we put in the model $500 million, which is our contribution to repayment of principal for the year. So that's how much cash we'll be looking at putting in this year."
49,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,49,Operator,,,And we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
50,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,50,Steve Byrne,,,"I wanted to drill in a little more on the $350 million of cost cuts. Can you describe what functional areas and businesses these came from? And perhaps, you can talk a little bit about the learnings from your benchmarking analysis. Any specific productivity initiatives that have come out of that?"
51,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,51,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, Steve. So let me try to hit it and then ask Howard, if I miss anything, to come in. So it isn't -- I think most people will go to this and say that it's headcount-related. We have tried not to do that. Obviously, we've got almost all of our plants running today. So we're trying to support our customers. We are idling some capacity, but we aren't laying off people in order to do that. We've cut discretionary spend. And then obviously, big buckets of spend like travel and other things are near 0. And so there's been a shift in some of the spending. We've moved out some turnaround activity. That carries with it, obviously, some discretionary expense that goes along."
52,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,52,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"And so we've looked at different types of activities like that where we can cut discretionary spend out, and we've got that modeled out for the rest of the year. But we haven't -- given that this is a pandemic and one of the biggest challenges around the world has been -- the number of people that are unemployed, we have not tried to add to that because that's a burden right now for a lot of governments around the world."
53,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,53,Howard I. Ungerleider,President & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"We've also done a fair amount of digitalization as we brought the DuPont assets in and set up for regional back-office centers, one in China, one in the Netherlands, one in the U.S. here in Michigan, and then another in São Paulo. So we've been able to do a lot of streamlining as well."
54,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,54,Operator,,,"And next, we'll move to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets."
55,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,55,Arun Shankar Viswanathan,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I guess I just wanted to ask about both polyethylene and polyurethanes. Both markets have gone through some structural changes here, polyethylene on the feedstock side and potentially demand side; polyurethanes on the demand side with maybe reduced demand for consumer discretionary items. I guess, would you agree with those characterizations? And I guess, when you think about that, thinking longer term, do you foresee any changes in your strategy? In polyurethanes, you've talked about adding systems houses and PE, you talked about selling up. Are those still valid in this environment? Have you seen new customers trade down or change their strategy as well?"
56,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,56,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"Arun, I think we'll get back to the growth playbook, as we mentioned in the script. And I think it's just a matter of timing here. So it doesn't make sense right now to continue to plow cash and the capacity when the demand in Europe and North America and Latin America has slowed down because people are staying at home. So that's why we're taking some of the actions that we're taking right now, it's just to balance that demand. But that demand will come back. People are not going to stay at home forever. We're helping governments right now with safe ways to return to work. And we're operating safely 14,000 Dow people go to the sites every day, and we're operating safely and people are healthy."
57,"Dow Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,57,James R. Fitterling,CEO & Chairman,EXECUTIVES,"So we know it can be done, but it's just going to take some time before the consumer confidence to come back. And that's why we're doing what we're doing. Downstream expansions in our Industrial Solutions and in our functional silicones products are still continuing. Systems house will come back as the automotive business and the installation and construction business comes back, and we'll continue to look at downstream on plastics."
