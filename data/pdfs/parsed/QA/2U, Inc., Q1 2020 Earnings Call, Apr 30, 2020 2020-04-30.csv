0,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse.
1,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Brad Alan Zelnick,"Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great. Thank you so much, guys. I know this is an earnings call, but I just want to start by acknowledging how fantastic your mission is and especially how you're helping the world during the current crisis. I think it's just really, really important to say that."
2,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, Brad. Really appreciate it."
3,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,Brad Alan Zelnick,"Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,You're quite welcome. I've got question?
4,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes, go ahead."
5,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,Brad Alan Zelnick,"Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, no, please. You go ahead."
6,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"No, it's just -- it's been an unbelievable 6 weeks. I will tell you, we've been -- we really -- I feel like we are a microcosm a little bit of what's happening in higher ed and everything from our ELPA program, where you've got people on the front lines to our nursing programs, to our public health programs. You've got -- it does -- it is super motivating to the employees, and it should be and I'm very proud of the work they're doing, but thank you for saying it."
7,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"For sure, I really mean it. I had a question for you, Chip, and a quick follow-up for Paul. So Chip, in an earlier press release, you mentioned the company has begun developing solutions to enable continuity for universities on-campus and online efforts in the fall. Can you expand on this a little bit more and how we should think about this from a monetization standpoint as well as new partner relationships?"
8,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Well, we have 73 partners. So there's a lot to do just within our partner base. So the first step was just to make sure everybody was up and running and doing as well as possible, and that's why we rolled out the training and all of that. For the fall, we think by the next call, we'll be able to give a better estimate as to what the new solutions will look like, how they'll be structured. So 2U OS Essential, as we're calling it, is, we think does allow the company to potentially open the door to some new university partners. And it's a combination of our technology and our support and we've had a really good response to it. Unfortunately, as you know, this is rapidly evolving and not much time has passed. So we're not yet at a point where we can give you too much clarity on exactly how many schools and what it looks like. But we do think it's a different model than the J-curve that you see in the investment programs. Now separately, what's also become clear, and this part, we can say strongly, is that pipeline for our existing model will increase because of this. We're being careful and thoughtful about what we choose to do. And as a company, we have not made a decision to increase the number of sort of traditional investment-based model programs that will run yet. But there's no doubt that demand has picked up. I think the pandemic has sort of multi- dimensional impact to our partners. And it's clear that the investment model will be in more demand. So Brad, I think by the time we get to the next call, we'll have a lot more to say. Schools are in the decision- making period in terms of how they're going to handle fall. Studio in the Box is pretty interesting because I think the notion of -- what people really need right now, it's a little bit less about the technology. The technology is the enabling function, but it's the pedagogy, the expertise of how to drive high-quality online instruction and how to do it in an environment where you can't go to a studio easily. And so very proud of the innovation that's occurred there. We've got a bunch of these being deployed right now, and we really like what it means for the company, go forward. But in the short term, we're thinking much more about just how to support the schools, not necessarily focused on the financial benefits of it. We do think long term, it will have great financial benefits. But net-net, we're thinking more about the people. These are relationships we've had for a very long time. And in some cases, we've had quite a bit of inbound of folks that are interested in us helping them figure out how to build something positive going forward. So it's just been an extraordinary 4 to 6 weeks, and we obviously had to convert during the process. So no shortage of activity going on here, that I will tell you."
9,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"That all makes a lot of sense. And maybe just for Paul, does the convertible note transaction and in particular, upsizing the initial deal, in any way, change the way you're thinking about program launches or future investments?"
10,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Brad, one of the main things we wanted to -- we set out to do here at the beginning of the year is to give ourselves flexibility. We want to focus on positive cash flows. We want to focus on positive EBITDA, and we wanted to ensure that we had the financial flexibility. This transaction allowed us to do that. I mean, I listed some of them, right? Let me revisit them for you. The first one is financial covenants. The second one is $11 million savings on free cash, if you will, because we're not going to pay that much of interest expense anymore. It does give us the latitude. However, all of this is governed by the framework that we outlined back in the fourth quarter of '19 which is we're going to manage by ROIC. We're going to choose and select the programs as we optimize cash, and we're going to do it for the same quality that our partners have accustomed receiving from us. The bottom line is we want to set ourselves up as well what we're trying to accomplish as a company. Once we're disciplined, I think we will have the flexibility to increase cadence if we need to."
11,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.
12,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,Jeffrey Marc Silber,BMO Capital Markets Equity Research,ANALYSTS,"Chip, I think you might have alluded to this in your earlier response, but I'm just curious in terms of the types of the conversations that you're having with the university partners, either the ones that are your current partners or potential partners. What are they looking for near term? What are they looking for longer term?"
13,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"I mean, Jeff, so something we've been doing that, first of all, I would say, in 4 weeks, we've had more Chancellor, Provost, President, CFO conversations than we had in 12 years. I don't think that's an overstatement. It's been extraordinary. And one of the things we've been doing, we've -- our -- the President of our Program Management Group, of our partner relationships, Andrew Hermelin, has been hosting these social hours that are fascinating. It's just Andrew and a variety of a really cross sort of functional group of presidents and provosts that wouldn't normally be in a room together, from a variety of different types of our partners, big state schools, elite private institutions, liberal arts schools, and it's been really something. This is a moment in time where I do feel like we have a point of view about what's going on across higher ed that I think is pretty unique because of the broad sort of scope of our partner base and they definitely are looking for solutions to help drive quality online. I think everybody recognizes what happened in the fall won't cut it on a go-forward basis. And so there is some -- and not for the fall, I'm sorry, for the spring. So there is some shorter-term needs in terms of just getting a higher quality online course up and running. And really, that's about the pedagogy. That's about being intentional about learning outcomes with each lesson and it's not just about sort of a remote Zoom lecture. I think we've all become -- we're all in Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting. And creating a high-engaging environment is, of course, Zoom is a great partner of ours. And we're thrilled to have them as a partner. But you've got to drive a higher quality overall online learning experience. So that's been one conversation. And then we have engaged just really over the last couple of weeks on sort of more forward-looking, whether this last -- this -- how long this lasts in the current state, we obviously all will start to get out of the immediate stage of the pandemic where we can have some -- get back to offices and schools. But schools, to give them credit, are dealing with not only something unprecedented, but you can -- what I see is happening right now is the pure hybridization of all online -- of all higher education. This is the hybridization of higher ed overnight. And people see the need for it. And I do feel genuinely blessed to be in the seats that we're in right now. We are at the sort of crux of the whole thing, and we're really well positioned. But right now, the key is just delivering for the partners. And I would say, of course, the first stage is just making sure that everybody is in a good place. Everybody is healthy and that our employees -- we start with our employees, but as you move through this, it also became very clear to me as CEO, to our executive team, to our Board that we have a massive responsibility right now to deliver for these schools right when they need it most. And not just to deliver for them for next week, but to think about this over a multiyear period and how we can be uniquely beneficial. And if you think about it, we -- some people saying, higher education won't get a countercyclical benefit, we can already throw that out the window. That's super clear that if you have high-quality online programs based on what's happened in the last just 2 weeks, that the demand is going to go up. But those that were saying that were saying it's because of the alternative credentials. Well, we're one of the only companies that offers boot camps and short courses, and we've got a decade-plus track record of doing this. So I just feel like this all happened and we are the company that needs to be there and is being there for our partners. So you're hearing maybe some sense of personal responsibility that we deliver for folks at this moment. And I'm proud to tell you that we do feel that we are delivering."
14,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Great. Let me just drill down a little bit further. And again, I think you alluded to this a little bit earlier. Do you think you're going to see more demand on the undergraduate side? I know we've already had strong demand on the graduate side. But is that an area we think we'll have further penetration?"
15,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. As a result of this, one of the things that has happened is you will hear us very soon announce our second undergrad program. We are -- we will get the announcement out as soon as we can. We do think there is real demand for undergrad, and we're very pleased with the initial results of our first undergrad program, which obviously was done before any of us had heard of coronavirus. So it happens to be good timing, but a thoughtful plan is to how to drive a high-quality online undergrad experience. It has been well underway at 2U now for a long time, and that's becoming certainly more relevant. Now I think what we want to make sure we emphasize to this community is that, that doesn't mean that we're sort of throwing out the window, all the things we said to you over the last 9 months, about how we're thinking about our investments and how we're thinking about guiding the company's financial picture. So we have to be able to balance the agenda, but there is no doubt, to answer your question directly, that demand is up."
16,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,Your next question comes from the line of Ms. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler from Macquarie Group.
17,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Hi, great to hear everybody's voices and happy to hear you're all safe and well. Chip, I wanted to start with a question for you around the competitive environment out there. Are you seeing anything from your competitors or any shifts in the landscape like has happened over the past several years that you think is worth pointing out at this time?"
18,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director this career curriculum continuum that we have the sort of breadth of the offerings that I just don't think anybody else really has. And combine that with when you look at what happened with remote learning, it was interesting that prior to COVID, we have passed 700,000 live classes, like we've done this at a scale that I don't think anybody else has. And our Gallup study, I thought was really interesting because we debuted it for the investor -- the virtual Investor Day. And it should put a nail in the coffin of any question whether online can be as good as the campus. If you do it right, it's really good. And we know how to do it right. And so from a competitive standpoint, we do feel like quality is going to continue to matter here. So the idea is higher education should be blended and connected, it should be -- the hybrid is real, and we're good at that. And I feel like the -- we haven't had 10 seconds to think about competition in the last 6 weeks, that I will tell you. So it's sort of just back to our conversations with our partners in terms of how to support them. And we are excited that it does look like what will come out of this is a broader partner base."
19,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,Sarah Emily Hindlian-Bowler,Macquarie Research,ANALYSTS,"Awesome. That's really helpful, Chad. And then just this might be for you or for Paul, I'll let you guys decide. But I'm just wondering, I think it's really great that you discussed on this call balancing positive free cash flow with the need to invest with these partners at such a critical time in the world and with such an opening for distance learning. How do you think about potentially balancing, adding more new grad or undergrad programs in the 5 we were discussing most recently about, if you really do see windows and how you're balancing, thinking about free cash flow positive -- being positive, with also the need to really take advantage of this opening for distance learning."
20,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Let me see if I can start off here, and Chip can jump in after. Look, at the end of the day, I think we have -- we provide a benefit to society here in the offerings that we provide. At the same time, we are in an environment where these things are needed, that societal benefit is needed. So to some extent, we have to balance with an eye towards, we are needed. Society needs us, and we have to be there for them during that period of time. At the same time, I think we can -- we were talking internally today about various opportunities. And one of the questions was, should we say, yes, or should we say no. And I said there is a third answer. The third answer is, we can say, yes, but it's about how we say yes. What does yes mean? Does it look and feel like one of our normal programs? Does it look and feel like something different? So we are in the process of looking at everything through the framework of return on invested capital. We're looking at it from the perspective of how do we optimize the cash and the liquidity position that we have. And at the same time, how do we fulfill our duty to society because they're looking for us at this time of need. So it is a balance across the 3. And I think opportunities are not going to wait for us. I think we have to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. So I think we will lean towards helping as best as we can and as quickly as we can because I think we're in a position to do so, particularly with the capital structure flexibility that we just got ourselves in the last month or so."
21,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,Operator,,,Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson.
22,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,Rishi Nitya Jaluria,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division 2 here. First, wanted to ask with the go-to-market being virtual, obviously, in this environment and some of the dialing back of advertising spend. Just how are you thinking about sales and marketing efficiency from here, especially as we think about optimizing the model for the balance of growth and profitability? And then the other question was just in terms of thinking about payments from university partners? Any color that you can provide in terms of are there university partners looking for extension on payment terms or restructuring or anything like that?"
23,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"So on the second one, easy answer, that, that's not been an issue. On the first, I would say the -- as Paul mentioned in his script, we are pushing the benefit of lower advertising costs to drive towards the efficient frontier of these individual marketing funnels and individual marketing opportunities. And effectively, what that means is our partners need us right now. You're talking about significant dislocations to things like international students in each of these universities. And so the fact that we're very clearly up and running, the fact that even our boot camps, which was the one part of our business that was physical, now, not only are they online, but they might always be online because it's going really, really well. So that is of importance to the partners. So we are pushing forward aggressively right now because we can. We're open, and these are strong high-quality options for people. And I would also say, options that can help people have a more productive life once they graduate. Like right now, the rescaling opportunity on the boot camp side has never been more needed. I mean, you're talking about people that with the number of dislocations for individuals in terms of the unemployment rate, we think this is a moment in time where people need to reskill and so we are continuing to drive the outcomes. And obviously, the marketing is part of that. And we're using this opportunity to create sort of more robust funnels for the university partners, not less."
24,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,Operator,,,Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer.
25,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,Brian Jeffrey Schwartz,"Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Chip, wanted to ask you a question on a different topic and subject. It's about your portfolio of products and services. Really, it's about the future and capitalizing on the elevated lead flow that you're seeing. So can you share with us how you plan to cross-sell to these students and learners as they enter the 2U universe here from different front doors? I know it's early here, but I'm just wondering if you're seeing any monetization synergies with the 3 different product offerings? For example, are you seeing a short course student maybe continuing on their curriculum, signing up for the boot camp or the DGP business? And just was hoping if you could just provide a little more color into the strategy around that. And that sounds like you are seeing some early traction. Then I have a follow-up for Paul."
26,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. We are definitely -- we think the value of share across the portfolio is very significant. We think the value of the content across the portfolio is significant. We have more schools that are embedding technical training into their various programs. We think that over time, offering technical training for credit is really appealing. And clearly, from a marketing synergy standpoint, I think people do forget that when we acquired GetSmarter a couple of years ago, you had a pretty small overall core space. And now we're getting to the point where we've got a broader portfolio of individual courses. And so you obviously can't cross-sell when there's not a lot to cross-sell. And now that we've got more options for people, the CCC is pretty fluid. Some people enter the career curriculum continuum because they're -- they've graduated from high school and they want to go right to learn to become a coder. And then they eventually may take a short course. Some people like me might progress from undergrad to eventually a master's degree, and I might need a blockchain course because I'm not entirely sure what it is. You've got different people entering at different stages, and it just creates an opportunity for us to meet the student where they are and to provide that learning experience to the student. That was a big part of the reason that we actually acquired the 2 companies we did. So early days still on share, but it's attractive."
27,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,27,Brian Jeffrey Schwartz,"Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then Paul, the follow-up question that I had -- it's maybe a follow-up on the earlier question, but maybe I'll just ask it a little bit differently tactically. When you scrubbed and looked over the cost structure of the business, where did you see the most opportunity to kind of cut back to protect cash flows?"
28,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,28,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"So I mean, I think there are a couple of things. We have some natural levers as we think of the integration of the 3 businesses over time. As we continue to bring together GetSmarter, Trilogy and traditional 2U, that was one of the things that we started doing midway through last year, and we saw a lot of that type of savings as we got into the fourth quarter. But those happens to be run rate savings, meaning they continue and build upon themselves over time. In addition to that, as we become a larger company, having centralized procurement and sourcing and doing things in a centralized fashion and benefiting from volume scale, those types of things are the traditional things that we've put in place so far that are getting us the type of synergies that we expect to see as we move forward. And then in today's environment, as we go through working from home, we see the benefits of P&E, travel-type savings. And then at our technology platform, our technology build, how do we build technology consistently across the 3 offerings? And then marketing, as we bring the marketing teams together, and think about, while we may not have one marketing algorithm that goes across all 3 of our offerings, we can at least have a consistency of methodology, a consistency of the way of doing business, things like that. So we're seeing benefits also in that environment. And as we sit here today and look forward in 2020, as Chip alluded to in his prepared remarks, we are seeing lower cost per lead. So that is giving us some benefits on the marketing side. However, we will spend on the marketing side because at the end of the day, the marketing side is more driven and governed by the marketing frontier and it's more governed by yield and conversion. But those are some of the areas. We are still -- we have several plans. Our Chief Operating Officer, Mark"
29,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,29,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Chernis, spends time with the organizational structure, the organizational design, how we do things."
30,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,30,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"We're not building a company to cut cost. We're building an organization to operate efficiently and serve our partners better so that the students can have a better experience. And if we continue to refine the organizational design and how we do things, then we will generate efficiency through that, and it becomes more sustainable type of cost structure. So those are some of the areas that I touched on there, and I think we will continue to see this type of efficiency as we go through time."
31,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,31,Operator,,,Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
32,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,32,Keen Fai Tong,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"You talked a bit about marketing costs that are decreasing in the current environment. And just overall, a more thoughtful approach to launching programs that have a higher ROIC, which over time should have positive implications for free cash flows. Can you discuss your broader expectations for free cash flow performance and when you might expect to breakeven?"
33,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,33,Paul S. Lalljie,Chief Financial Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So I mean, I think if we -- let me speak of this from 2 components. On our fourth quarter call, I talked about, our goal was to have a crossover somewhere midway through 2021, the first half of 2021, meaning crossing over to a quarter where we are cash flow-accretive versus a use of cash in that particular period. And then probably until the next calendar year to have a full year of free cash flow positive. The performance we had this quarter, I would break down the performance in 3 components. I mean, part of it is the cost savings and the activities that Mark and his organization are leading in the company. But then we have also the component of lack of travel and other savings around working remotely, things like that. If we split those 2 things, I would say we have us a real sustainable improvement in the free cash flow that we saw this quarter, and that puts us ahead of plan. So I'm providing a response that is more aligned with the things we said pre-COVID because in this environment that we're in, it's harder for me to predict when this is going to end, what the top line is going to be like, what are the new opportunities, what are some of the impact, if any, that is negative and how long that is going to last. So it's hard for me to predict in this current environment. But I can -- what I can say to you, the trends are looking good given what we delivered in the first quarter here. And we have no reason to doubt that, that will not continue as we go through the year."
34,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,34,Keen Fai Tong,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Got it. Very helpful. And then just stepping back broadly, you mentioned that the pandemic can have both the positive and the negative impact on the business. Can you just elaborate on the factors that could cause the growth to decelerate, so the downside factors? I know boot camps were previously thought to be a risk. Now it could potentially be an opportunity. Placements on the grad side, also another swing factor. So can you maybe elaborate on some of the things that you do see as downside risks to growth?"
35,"2U, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,35,Christopher J. Paucek,"Co-Founder, CEO & Director",EXECUTIVES,"Right. So an example of something that we had to do in Q1 is immersions, are physical moments where a student goes to be together with their classmates somewhere in the world, very often on-campus, but not always. So there's a lot of global immersions. And before COVID, the only time we ever sort of had a moment where we lost -- we lost revenue from an immersion that got canceled was you might have remembered when Mexico City had that huge earthquake. There was actually quite a large immersion for one of our partners that was there, and it got canceled like urgent, and we had to deal with that. And obviously, that was lost revenue. So we had some immersions in Q1 that we just couldn't replace. There was no option of replacing them. It was urgent, and we had to cancel them, and that was it. So we had that impact in Q1 but obviously delivered Q1 even with that impact. What's good about the immersions emergency designation and more likely to be open or open quicker than other things. So we think we can mitigate that impact pretty well. And you did mention, George, boot camps. When this first happened, we did see a dip in demand. And we're kind of in the opposite stage now. We're seeing -- that's become a positive, and you might have heard me mention in my prepared remarks that we weren't online with all the boot camps. And to give our boot camp team -- when this happened, our COO, very focused on, ""Okay, we've got to get everything -- we've got get all these boot camps online."" And Greg Calverase, our Managing Director for boot camps, got everything online and 5 days later, it's all online. And I will tell you what's happened since is not only high satisfaction, but a broader sort of catchment area for the boot camp and we think that, that is something that's really more likely to be something that sticks around with us. So obviously, it's early days, but it's positive so far. So there are clearly impacts but once we got through, in some ways, the sort of urgent trying to figure out the world toilet paper stage, where you were dealing with the basic necessities and have gotten into a period where people have a little bit more time on their hands, it's clear that things like our shared courses are going to be in heavy demand. So excited about what the opportunity lie ahead for the company."
