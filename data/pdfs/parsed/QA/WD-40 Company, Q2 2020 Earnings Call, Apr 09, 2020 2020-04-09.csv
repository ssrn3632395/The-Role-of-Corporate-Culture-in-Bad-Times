0,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.
1,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,1,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"So I guess I was most struck by Steve's comment that March was similar to previous March results. So I guess you're kind of saying that sales were flattish, not significantly down. I find that hard to believe, given that we've had a suspension of almost all nonessential manufacturing in the United States, in other countries. So can you just kind of give us a little more color? And also, we've had a lot of investors ask us about a breakdown of your demand by end market. So like how much is automotive, how much would be high tech, manufacturing, different end-market demand. Do you think you could give a little color on all of that?"
2,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,2,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Thanks, Linda. We were pleased with being able to hold up in March. And I guess it does really reflect on our multiple trade channel, multiple country business strategy. As far as trade channels are concerned, I'll ask Steve just to give a high-level view of the key channels that we operate in."
3,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,3,Steven A. Brass,President & COO,EXECUTIVES,"Sure. Thanks, Garry. So as Garry said, I mean, one of the big advantages of WD-40 Company is that we are diversified both by trade channel and by geographies. So no one trade channel, customer or geography is -- we're not overly reliant. The biggest markets we operate in, our automotive, DIY hardware, e-commerce, as we mentioned on the call, is a fast-growing channel, both in terms of percentage growth and also dollar volume, so -- and an industry as well being the -- one of the big 4. And -- but the beauty is the diversification. And so no one of those trade channels has an overbearing weight on the overall revenues."
4,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,4,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,So do you expect -- I mean are you seeing anything in your end markets that indicate that because the decline in China was quite significant. So is it just the rest of the world is slower in seeing the impact in regarding COVID-19 in China?
5,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,5,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I can give you some color on that, Linda. The down -- what happened in China was due to a planned shipments that we had that were to go out to our customers straight after Chinese New Year. We had a substantial order book in place. And as is customary, China kind of waits till after Chinese New Year to renew themselves and to take on that inventory. And so if the COVID hadn't happened, we would have shipped those orders. So it wasn't an end user a demand issue, it was our inability to ship that caused the sudden downturn in China."
6,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,6,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"China started the shutdown around January 17 and was outright through till well into February, and we didn't -- we weren't able to ship what we had. We are starting to ship those orders now. So that's why there's a difference between China. If you think about in the world right now, most of the dominant trade channels that we operate in are functioning, hardware, home improvement, grocery, club, mass merchant, those trade channels are operating, albeit at a different level. So people are buying. I drove past my local home improvement store this morning and the parking lot was 75% full. People are going there to buy a product, probably WD-40 as well. So there were 2 different things that went on between China and what's happening in the U.S."
7,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,7,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Okay. That's a good explanation. So can you talk about just your innovation that you were planning to launch? I think it was you were talking about June or July? Are you going to delay that or are you still going to launch your major innovation?
8,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,8,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"We are still going ahead. You're referring to Smart Straw 2 or Smart Straw next generation. The first market to launch that will be Canada in June. And we're also moving ahead with the continued conversion of our Specialist product range into the new blue and yellow, red top trade dress from our brand architecture. And we will continue to work on the rollout of Smart Straw next generation around the world. It will probably take us 18 months in total to get it out there as it was in the past, but no, we're full steam ahead."
9,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,9,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then just finally, in terms of the gross margin, I guess relative to at least my estimate, it was kind of disappointing in the quarter. And you mentioned, I think mix issue was quite a big issue. It seems like in many quarters, mix seems to be an issue. And I'm just wondering, is the idea that you're continuing to shift people toward the Smart Straw and Specialist, which is a higher-margin product. Is that still occurring? And then if so, what are these -- I don't know, it seems like almost like a recurring issue with mix that impacts your gross margin?"
10,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,10,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. I'll touch some of it -- and I'll give it to Jay, if I can. The mix issue in this quarter was the shortfall of sales in China. We have a higher gross margin in China. And because our sales fell into the gutter there completely, that was the issue. Jay, I'll pass on to you for the rest."
11,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,11,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"Yes. Thanks, Garry. Yes, Linda, that was -- a lot of what happens is in our direct -- the other is -- the depending on the volumes in any given period that go through those 2 distribution channels. So our MD markets, our marketing distributor markets, have a quite a bit lower margin as a whole, our direct markets have a much higher margin. And then when we see mixes between -- there's also even mixes between markets. So for example, there's much higher-margin in Europe than there is in the U.S. based on just the sophistication of the distribution channel and the size of the market."
12,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,12,Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser,"D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And can I just sneak in one last one. Going back to look at your financial results back in the last recession in the '08, '09 period, I think it was an 8% sales decline, if I'm not mistaken. So you did have a sales decline. I know you don't want to give guidance, you're withdrawing your guidance. But would it be a bad idea for conservative analysts to put something like an 8% decline or something like that, assuming we go into a recession?"
13,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,13,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,I'll let Jay answer that.
14,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,14,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Linda, the decline that was -- you mentioned for 2008 was primarily because of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound. It devalued some 25%, I think, in 2008. And I think right now, it would be irresponsible for us to try and predict the future until we get through what we have to get through now. I think we'll have a better idea once the world starts to ramp up again. So -- but in the U.S., in 2008, our sales went sideways. Our consolidated revenue went down, but that was because of the change in the exchange rate from the British pound. Right, Jay?"
15,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,15,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. Actually, we had a shortfall in the U.S. We actually, in local currency or in-source currency, we were -- we had growth in EMEA, but it was wiped out because of the headwind from foreign currency exchange."
16,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,16,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies.
17,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,17,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,I got cut off at the end of the prepared remarks. So forgive me if this has already said but did you indicate that the dividend is largely intact that you're not considering cutting that at this point?
18,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,18,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"No. Yes, we did issue a dividend. The Board declared a dividend, and we -- excuse me, we will issue a dividend at the end of the month."
19,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,19,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Right. But I'm saying going forward in the second half of the year, given the uncertain outlook."
20,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,20,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That -- we make those dividend decisions on a quarterly basis. I mean our policy hasn't really changed, and that is -- we look first to pay a dividend out at 50% of our earnings, and that strategy continues."
21,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,21,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then, Garry, you mentioned seeing in your local distribution channel that things were still going -- your channels are still relatively intact there, and I assume that's with the home improvement market. But I was wondering if you're seeing similar things with both the construction, commercial and then just industrial activity, given the lack of commercial and industrial activity and auto activity, I was wondering, I would assume that you're seeing significant declines in those distribution channels or the channels through those end markets."
22,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,22,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Daniel, we're not seeing it yet. It's probably too early, but let me say this, construction is -- at least in California, has been designated as an essential service. As I drive around, I see trucks out, builders out, auto repair stores are still open. The auto industry in itself, in the manufacturing side, I don't think that's huge consumption, but people are fixing cars, the auto zones, O'Reillys, the brake part areas, the oil change people, they're all operating. So stuff is getting done at this time."
23,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,23,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then final question. You indicated that the CapEx, I think, is going to be at $30 million this year. We assume -- am I right to model that starting next year, it goes back more towards a traditional level? Or is it going to stay at this kind of elevated level as you guys continue to roll things out?"
24,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,24,Garry O. Ridge,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Jay?
25,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,25,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"We would expect it to go back to very close to historical levels. Once we complete the project with the innovation around our next-generation Smart Straw, we don't have any other significant investments that are begging for a lot of capital."
26,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,26,Daniel Dalton Rizzo,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Is that project expected to be completed this year?
27,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,27,Jay W. Rembolt,"CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer",EXECUTIVES,"It will be -- there will be some carryover into '21, FY '21."
28,"WD-40 Company, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,28,Operator,,,"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today's conference call and ask that you please disconnect your lines."
