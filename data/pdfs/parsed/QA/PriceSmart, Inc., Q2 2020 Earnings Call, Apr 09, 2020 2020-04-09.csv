0,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Rodrigo Echagaray with Scotiabank.
1,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,1,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Congrats, Michael, on your new role. I would say, on my end, I'd like to perhaps hear your thoughts on what will it take for you to revisit store openings? And I guess, more specifically, is this related more to the temporary disruptions on COVID-19? Or is it more related to structural concerns with regards to the region where you operate in terms of the macro short to mid-term?"
2,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,2,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,And I guess the second question would be on the e-commerce front. What kind of growths are you seeing in the past few days? Any color that you can share with us would be great.
3,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,3,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Rodrigo, so if I understand your first question was basically our decision to suspend some of the store openings or the club openings, and you wanted a little color about -- around that, correct?"
4,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,4,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes, I mean I guess, how are you thinking about that? I mean I guess I'm trying to get a sense on -- are we perhaps being obviously responsible and cautious for obvious reasons. But once disruptions cease and everything goes back to ""normal"", then are we looking at those store openings being back on the pipeline quickly? Or is it something that it will take a few months until you feel comfortable putting those back in the pipeline?"
5,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,5,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Well, let me put it to you this way. Before the pandemic, we were completely on track for those openings. So it wasn't anything structural or in terms of the market themselves that led us to decide not to do it. It was the pandemic. And then of course, the resulting impact of the pandemic can and may have on these markets going forward, which is really the part that is the big unknown for all of us at this point."
6,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,6,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So with that kind of a variable at play, the best answer I can give you is that we're just monitoring it."
7,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,7,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We're trying to get the best information we can and assess what the impact on our markets are, and then at the appropriate time we will move forward. So as of now, it seems that the most prudent thing to do in the face of this kind of unexpected event was to suspend that and to preserve capital and focus on delivering our best performance for our members with the clubs that we have in the markets where we exist."
8,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,8,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it.
9,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,9,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Your second question related to e-commerce growth. E-commerce, it's hard to quantify. Again, this is all happening so quickly. I can tell you anecdotally that the response we're getting, we track social media now and we're much more connected to our members digitally. We're seeing the response and the reaction to having more online presence, the fact that our members can go now online and see our products, order them, pay for them, at least in our first location so far. And that's all been extremely favorable."
10,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,10,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Now it's about building up quickly, ramping up the operational side to be able to support the demand. So I can't quantify for you what the demand is, but you can sort of assume that when people don't want to leave their home or if they do leave their home, they don't want to spend a lot of time being exposed to other people who might be carrying the virus. There's a real demand for e-commerce, and there's a real demand for all of the types of shopping that you can do that minimizes physical interaction with other people. And that's what we're focused on, and that's what we've been expediting and making great progress on in a very short period of time."
11,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,11,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And so I guess, can you maybe share if all the stores or an x percentage of the stores have now the ability to -- for customers to shop online and maybe do click and collect, how many stores are we looking at that are capable of doing this?"
12,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,12,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Well, okay, if you look at the capabilities, the first step is to make sure that all the inventory that's available in the clubs is visible online. So having the online catalog that shows a description, the price, the -- whether or not the product is available, that now exists in all of our countries. So that's a development that's happened since this pandemic was announced."
13,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,13,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Then you add on that the ability to -- once you have that information, it opens the doors to the alternative ways of shopping. One is the ability to e-mail or through phone conversations, contact a PriceSmart employee and be able to get an order or order something to be picked up or delivered. That's what we're calling assisted shopping. That's happening throughout a number of our clubs at this time."
14,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,14,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"The most advanced right now is the click and collect, which is -- I'm sorry, the Click and Go, which is in -- we launched it in Costa Rica, in our Santa Ana club, and that's been going extremely well. And we have a very aggressive rollout plan to all of our other markets in a matter of weeks. So we started with one, make sure we got the kinks out and we're doing it right and set up the protocol so that we can efficiently roll this out throughout the rest of the company."
15,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,15,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"That sounds like you guys have really stepped it up in the last few weeks, which makes a lot of sense. And on the delivery, if I can just maybe double-click on that for a second. I think you're..."
16,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,16,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. You're -- just so you know officially you're on question number four, but it's okay, go ahead."
17,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,17,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I'm sorry about that. I'm just going to leave it at that -- and hopefully, somebody else."
18,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,18,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"It's okay, Rodrigo, I'm just giving you hard time."
19,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,19,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"No, I know. I know. It's just that I have a lot of questions, but I'll let other ones take turns."
20,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,20,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"That's okay. Why don't you ask that last one, that's fine?"
21,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,21,Rodrigo Echagaray,"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Now, it's just on the delivery. I mean you were mentioning you're using both some aggregators and also you're doing some of that in-house. Can you maybe share more color on both of those strategies?"
22,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,22,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. As you know, given the fact that we operate in 13 different markets, the best solutions vary from market to market. In Colombia, we partner with Rappi, as one example. And it's not a one solution for each market. It varies. We do a combination of -- to having our own employees delivering. We've got -- we've secured vehicles that allow for us to be able to do deliveries, we partner with third parties. And we are right at -- on the brink of finalizing contracts with another major delivery service, if you will, that will be able to provide this service to our members throughout most of our markets. So it's a combination of different channels that allow us to get the product to the members."
23,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,23,Operator,,,Next question comes from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital.
24,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,24,Jonathan Paul Braatz,Kansas City Capital Associates,ANALYSTS,"As you tackle this COVID-19 issue, what kind of flexibility do you have in your cost structure at the store level? And have you been making adjustments there? I was just curious what may be potentially some deleveraging of expenses, how you're going to try and minimize that deleveraging of expenses?"
25,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,25,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Well, with regard to that, we're watching every penny as we should. And Michael is doing a great job of that. And we have eliminated or reduced what we consider to be any sort of excess. But having said that, we think it's very important to have a balanced approach, especially during this time. The initial instinct may be to just hunker down and dial back on everything."
26,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,26,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"But what we're actually finding is because of the situation, our team is able to move forward pretty quickly on interventions and on new initiatives that, frankly, we didn't know we could deliver on as quickly as we have. And in that effort, we're realizing we actually need to deploy our resources and our labor in a more thoughtful way because there's opportunities here to now reskill some of our employees and assign them tasks that will support these initiatives that we believe are not only needed by our members today, but are going to strengthen our company for the long term."
27,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,27,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"So while we're watching expenses and we're being vigilant about that and taking -- as responsible and as compassionate an approach as we possibly can, we're also not shy about making the right investments in the right areas that are going to get us through this stronger than we were coming into it."
28,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,28,Jonathan Paul Braatz,Kansas City Capital Associates,ANALYSTS,"Okay. Okay. The second question, Sherry, what are you seeing or maybe it's a little bit early, on the membership -- or new membership count. I saw that in Colombia, memberships were down year-over- year, up elsewhere. But how are your markets? how are the -- how are your -- how is memberships rolls as we get further and further into this COVID-19, are we seeing any material difference in the trend that we've seen over the last couple of years?"
29,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,29,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Well, I can't -- I don't have in front of me, March, but in terms -- I don't think we report anything in a partial month. So we're in April right now. So I can't really share anything more on that. But certainly, people right now are behaving differently in terms of what they're buying, how much they're buying, we're seeing surges, and then we're seeing changes in terms of average ticket and so on. But it's too soon for me to be able to share any kind of trend that I could predict or see emerging as a result of the membership."
30,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,30,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,Okay. All right. One last question. If the product mix shifts more to necessities as opposed to other items that aren't so essential. How does that influence your gross margins? How is -- a mix shift like that?
31,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,31,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Well, I mean we're constantly trying to manage margins appropriately. We are continually looking for ways to make sure that we are getting the best value for the member consistent with the Six Rights. As we see a greater need for essentials and basic necessities, we're leveraging local vendors as well and suppliers to make sure that we are able to deliver the products that they need. So at this point, it's, again, too soon to tell what will come out of this phase of a dramatic shift in the way that people are shopping. And the demand as well as the supply and -- but beyond that, I really don't have any more to share in terms of foresight."
32,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,32,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. All right. A lot of imponderables out there, and I wish you the best luck. It's a difficult environment."
33,"PriceSmart, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 09, 2020",QA,33,Sherry S. Bahrambeygui,CEO & Director,EXECUTIVES,"We really appreciate your well wishes, and we're doing the best we can and we're feeling good about our ability to get through this and take care of our members and learn a lot in the process."
