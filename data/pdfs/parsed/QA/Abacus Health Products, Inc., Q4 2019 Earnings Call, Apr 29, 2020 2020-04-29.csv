1,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,1,Operator,,,Our first question comes from Jenny [indiscernible] with Eight Capital.
2,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,2,Operator,,,This is Brian Lee on the call for Jenny Wang. My first question is what kind of impacts to sales and supply chain are you seeing recently due to COVID-19?
3,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,3,Operator,,,"Hank, do you want to answer that?"
4,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,4,Operator,,,"Sure. In terms of the supply chain, I can tell you that our contract manufacturer is continuing to operate and practicing the best CDC measures in a careful way. Our third-party logistics partners are continuing to operate and ship to customers."
5,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,5,Operator,,,"Got it. My next question is, is the Charlotte’s Web proposed acquisition of Abacus subject to HSR review?"
6,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,6,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Max Jacobs with Edison Group.
7,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,7,Maxim Jacobs,Edison Investment Research Limited,ANALYSTS,"Congrats on the great quarter. I was just wondering, though, on CBD CLINIC. So it was flat in Q4. Can you just talk about like maybe what might have been driving that? Because otherwise, it had a pretty good year."
8,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,8,Maxim Jacobs,Edison Investment Research Limited,ANALYSTS,"Sure. Well, I will tell you that the -- essentially, the industry as a whole, had actually a slight downturn in Q4. So we were now bullet proof to that. And sometimes, that is also cyclical. I can tell you from my former position in my former career in the pharmaceutical industry. Q4 tends to be lower in general. So the fact that we actually stayed flat, I'm okay with that. That is -- I would say that is -- that's secondly expected. ."
9,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,9,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,And so what was driving the industry-wide flatness in Q4? And just which industry are you referring to?
10,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,10,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,I'm really -- I'm talking about health care.
11,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,11,Maxim Jacobs,Edison Investment Research Limited,ANALYSTS,Okay. And so just expanding a little bit on the HSR review question. So you don't expect any antitrust concern with the Charlotte’s Web acquisition?
12,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,12,Maxim Jacobs,Edison Investment Research Limited,ANALYSTS,"Max, it's Jonathan. Sure, let me take that one. So the HSR Act has a threshold, which this deal does not reach yet from a dollar perspective. So currently, we do not expect to require the HSR approval."
13,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,13,Maxim Jacobs,Edison Investment Research Limited,ANALYSTS,"Okay, great. And then just one last question on the acquisition, which is just, so there's going to be a shareholder vote. I think you mentioned in early June. So I was just wondering how confident are you that the vote will be yes."
14,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,14,Jonathan Conforti,,EXECUTIVES,"Let me take that one. So first of all, in terms of the process, we expect to obtain interim court approval this week. We'll be extending out our circular probably in the next 10 days or so. We will have a shareholder vote that's scheduled for the beginning of June 4, and expect in terms of that particular activity, we had 20% of our votes that are already locked up and committed to those in favor of the agreement. In terms of the actual shareholder vote itself, 2/3 of the votes present at that vote are required. And so we feel very good about the transaction being approved by our shareholders. So it's obviously that they are committed already to the transaction as well as the feedback that we've gotten from other major shareholders, which has been very positive. So we are very confident that the transaction will be approved at the shareholder vote. It's a couple of days after that that we get final for approval and then would file the articles of arrangement shortly thereafter. So our view is kind of a mid- June time frame is probably when we would expect the transaction to completely close."
15,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,15,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Scott Fortune with Roth Capital.
16,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,16,Scott Thomas Fortune,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Real quick, I just kind of want to see the response from -- you had some upcoming product launches potentially in the convenience stores, specialty channels going forward? Kind of what's the response for these product launches now and kind of timing with COVID here? And then just kind of touch base on next innovation or project innovation lines that you guys are targeting going forward here?"
17,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,17,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, sure. So we are still in the process of launching these new lines. The c-store line, which is the convenience store line, is -- we had a little bit of delay in having final product delivered -- finished product delivered to us. COVID-19 did play a role in that. But we're really looking forward to this launch, and that launch is actually happening now as we speak. And some of the -- it's interesting, it's incredible to see whether it's a silver lining or not, but certain channels doing -- performing not a little bit better, but much better because of COVID-19, of course, online sales. But the grocery sector and even small convenience stores, the traffic is -- has increased substantially. And I don't think we could have had better timing to be able to launch our convenience store lines then now. So we're really looking forward to that. And again, that is happening as we speak. So convenience store line is being launched now and will continue, of course, through the next 3 quarters. The Gronk-inspired ingestible line, which we are super excited about, as I just described on our call, we'll be launching within a few months. And, of course, a lot of preparation for that launch, in marketing, in advertising. There's still a lot to do with that. But we are really right on target, right on plan, the schedule was delayed a couple of months because throwing marketing dollars in advertising during this pandemic really isn't the great ROI. So we are waiting it out a little bit. But we have rescheduled that for a few months from now, and we expect that to be a very successful launch. As far as -- we also have -- not only do we have our market side ingestible line, we also have an ingestible line going forward into the health care practitioner space. That, too, we put a little bit of cards on that, being that health care practitioner practicing and at this point in time, of course, going through a difficult period, difficult time. And so we are assessing that literally, if not every week, every day and making sure that we will be able to launch outline instinct with the opening of many practices and making sure that we can see the best ROI for our investment in marketing."
18,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,18,Scott Thomas Fortune,"Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then a little bit on the FDA side, obviously, with COVID-19, there's probably a little bit more delays from that side. But any information on kind of the FDA where they're leaning kind of continuing to build out ingestible and toxicology studies from that standpoint, any color from the FDA side from your side of things?"
19,"Abacus Health Products, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",QA,19,Perry Antelman,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"That is a great question. Well, now with COVID-19, I think FDA has their hands full. As far as ingestible, it is not a matter of if, it's more a matter of really when. I think the FDA is -- continues -- like, they really care about safety for the consumer. And that is really critical. Those guardrails are important for everybody in the industry for the manufacturers, the suppliers, the distributors, the sellers and the consumers. So we are looking forward for additional guidance from the FDA. They have given some additional guidance. We believe that ingestibles and allowance of ingestibles for the proper guardrails and safety considerations for the consumer, that those are coming, hopefully, sooner than later. But as we all know, the FDA, number one, again, our concern is safety for the consumer. And as more data continually now faster rolling, I know that they are effectively and efficiently reviewing that data so that safe products can be released and can be sold to the consumers sooner than later."
