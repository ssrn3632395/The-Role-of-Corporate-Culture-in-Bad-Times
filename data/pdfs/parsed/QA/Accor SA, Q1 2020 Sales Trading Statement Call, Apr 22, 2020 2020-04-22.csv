0,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Jaafar Mestari of Exane BNP Paribas.
1,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,1,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And I hope everyone is doing well. My first question really is a very general one on your management philosophy and your approach to this completely unprecedented crisis. Are you trying to build the smartest and the most detailed reopening schedule and budgeting towards that, maybe May, maybe June, but maybe September, who knows? Or are you doing everything on a worst-case basis? Are you preparing just in case minus 64% lasts for a number of months? That's my first question."
2,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,2,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And secondly, on the EBITDA sensitivity, thank you for highlighting that, so EUR 28 million right now without cost savings for each point of RevPAR but going to, I think you said, slightly north of EUR 20 million going forward. Is that something that actually continues to slightly improve the EUR 60 million OpEx savings that you've announced? Is this -- related to my first question, is this the first batch? Or is this something where you're going to be continuing to look at opportunities?"
3,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,3,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And lastly, ALL, I would assume it's not a great period to showcase a loyalty program right now, and I would assume no retail bank is going to want to launch a travel-branded credit card. So are you entirely suspending it? And is that committed marketing costs that you'll definitely not be spending? I did get a couple of e-mails suggesting I watch videos on the ALL websites."
4,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,4,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I'll let -- I will leave Jean-Jacques answer the question #2 and question #3. And just on question #3, as I said to you, we want to keep the phone going and relationship with the 63 million Accor Live Limitless members. It doesn't cost a penny to basically send them basically a WhatsApp and information. And what we're doing mostly is make sure that when they are at home and safe, we can actually provide them with a lot of initiative when it comes to whether it is gymnastic and other things. So as I guess, we keep contact in a different fashion. So on the -- and we need to do it. It's very important for the people to have news of Accor as the loyalty members."
5,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,5,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the first one, Jaafar, you are absolutely correct. Since we don't know the shape, the time, the nature of the recovery, everything we plan for is for the worst. Every assumption we have made within our core over the next 12 months is on a very, very gloomy, pessimistic scenario when it comes to EBITDA and when it comes to working capital. So -- and so hopefully, the turns -- it's going to turn to be better than expected, but no management should be preparing for blue sky when you simply don't know how to spell it. I know it's coming, but that's the -- but we're prepaying for the worst, of course. EBITDA?"
6,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,6,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. On -- just on the plan, Jaafar, I mean the EUR 60 million-plus is obviously in the plan. And as I said, that's why I say EUR 60 million-plus because EUR 60 million is the basis that we've been working on at the beginning, and we are going to a higher number than that one."
7,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,7,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And more generally, I think the one thing that we've learned through that crisis, and everybody has been learning that, is that the next week was not exactly the week that you had planned the week before, and so it has been an ongoing process by which we've been looking at the numbers as they were evolving and have been revising our plans as in fact the target was also moving. And so it's a very dynamic way by which we work with our operations on all these saving plans, having several review by region or by function in a given month. And so the thing with that is that the more you look and the more you find, the more people have got ideas on how to tackle and deal with situation. So it's going to be something that we're going to further push with time."
8,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,8,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And then on ALL, ALL is obviously part of it. ALL is obviously part of it, and so we gave you a number in February. You may recall, EUR 60 million as the P&L effect for the year. Into that, there is 20%, 30% of it that we will adjust for in the plan. But frankly, it is not the largest number that we've got to work on."
9,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,9,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"On credit card, Jaafar, we're going blind. We're going dark, sorry, on all the promotion and marketing campaign as we have announced in probably late March. Is -- on the credit card, you'll be surprised, talks are still undergoing with Visa, of course. But with ALL, the RFPs were being launched in different jurisdictions for Northern Europe, for Malaysia, for Australia, people are still working on it every day on basically preparing for those cards to be launched. There's no money being invested. But no -- none of the guys we've been talking to have stopped considering launching a travel card. It'd be delayed. But count on me, you're still going to have one."
10,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,10,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And maybe just a quick follow-up on your -- what you say about the worst case. If I do very quick math, EUR 150 million for the next 9 months, there's a worst-case where you have EUR 1.4 billion revenue hit effectively deeply into negative profits, much higher debt. What is the plan for that if that is the worst case?"
11,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,11,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Well, the -- what we're doing is, obviously, we've done all those mathematics. It tells you that, I guess, we can go much further than 9 months with the cash we have, which is also why we renegotiated the covenant with the holiday on any ratios with the commercial banks on a EUR 1.2 billion debt. So we have far sufficient time to basically cope with what could be 9 months, 12 months. And then we'll see -- we'll have better clarity after summer on where we are with the shape and the strength of that epidemic. I'm not talking vaccine here. Anybody know that vaccine is at least 18 months to 2 years away."
12,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,12,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"But one has to think that some medicine will be made available where people will no longer die from that or independent are we from other sources. I can tell you for a fact, we are not depending from any other sources than the cash we have on the balance sheet and no need for it until further notice."
13,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,13,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And just, Jaafar, I know it's obvious, but I'll say it nevertheless. I mean the savings are going to kick in as soon as April. So it'll be EUR 151 million, be EUR 150 million."
14,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,14,Jaafar Mestari,"Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley.
15,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,15,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Yes.
16,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,16,Operator,,,"Three questions, please. First, just on cash. Could you please give us the March -- end of March or even current cash number so we can calculate what we spent in Q1? Or better still, can you give us what your loss rate is, your monthly cash burn under the current sort of revenue situation?"
17,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,17,Operator,,,"Secondly, I'm just thinking about the services to owners and the comment you made on the fixed costs there, the EUR 20 million EBITDA sensitivity to 1% of RevPAR. I think if my math is right, about half that is in management franchise. So how much of the remaining sort of EUR 10 million is in STO versus hotel assets? And what is the exposure to owners being unable to reimburse you for what you're spending on the system and on management contracts?"
18,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,18,Operator,,,"And then finally, just a quick one. I guess there's not much going on. But in terms of the pipeline to your pipeline, I'm assuming things are slowing dramatically. What would your best guess be for unit growth perhaps for next year?"
19,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,19,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"JJ will do the first 2, and I'll do the third one."
20,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,20,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Just on cash, Jamie, you -- on the presentation we just did, we gave you, in fact, the cash at the end of March. It's EUR 2.5 billion. So we also wanted to provide you actuals. As much as it is difficult to make forecast, at least for the actual, we just wanted to make sure we provide you the information that we have to be giving you the best possible information. So that's on this one."
21,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,21,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"I mean on the cash burn, I think if you are to say that in the month of March, EUR 150 million is a number, you wouldn't be too far off. And again, this is something that will fluctuate over time on the basis of what is the cost saving but also on what is the extent in which things happen. If the crisis was to go for much longer, obviously, the action that you take and the way the number are shaped are not the same as if suddenly in June, you get your hotel to be filled back in given geographies and suddenly things flow back again."
22,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,22,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"So there is a lot of, I would say, parameters around what the numbers may be. But anyway, to give you a sense, I think the EUR 200 million is a good number. EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million is a good number. EUR 150 for the month and EUR 200 million for the quarter."
23,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,23,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"In terms of the bridge of the EUR 20-plus million, I think you're right in what you say on the portion that relates to hotel service. I gave you..."
24,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,24,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Management and franchise. You keep saying it on service. Management and franchise.
25,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,25,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"You're right, Sébastien, Management and franchise. Then I gave you what is the hotel assets, and so the remainder is STO, i.e., sales, marketing, distribution, loyalty."
26,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,26,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And on the last, which is the pipeline, I'll give you 2 numbers because one is coming from the 125 developers, who being -- telling us that, I guess, we still -- we should be looking at a 3%, plus or minus, net supply growth for the year. That number is being revised downward over the last 3 months, of course, but it's still pretty optimistic on the 3%. The numbers that I want to give you as a management team here -- because the developers are commercially minded, of course. Otherwise, it'd be poor developers. But I guess the number should be north of 2%, but in between 2% to 3%. But I won't bet on the 3% plus."
27,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,27,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"One additional element to this, which is worth noting, by the way, is part of the 3% plus or minus that the developers are talking about, 0.5% of that is what they call instant noodles, which is kind of a funny name. The instant noodles for them is different hotels unbranded or branded with somebody else who've been knocking on the door as they did actually in the last quarter of 2019, we had quite a few of them, on the people may be changing horse and talking to Accor on having Accor putting our brands very quickly for them to be able to weather the storms differently and probably have access to third-party financing that they couldn't have had if Accor was not there. So you may be -- we may be lucky and surprised in those instant noodles popping in. They want me to believe. But granted, it happened in the last quarter last year."
28,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,28,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"So can I just come back on the earlier answers? I think the release said at least EUR 2.5 billion? So the cash was actually EUR 2.5 billion, was it?"
29,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,29,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,EUR 2.5 billion.
30,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,30,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. And did you say EUR 150 million burn for March alone and EUR 200 million for the quarter? And if so, does that EUR 150 million include all other costs, not just OpEx?"
31,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,31,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean the EUR 150 million is the operating burn, i.e., if you were to do an acquisition, it's not into that, but there was no acquisition. So it's -- the operating free cash flow is -- we burn. If I were to buy a company, this is not in that number."
32,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,32,Jamie David William Rollo,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Sure. But interest and CapEx makes that a little bit higher.
33,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,33,Jamie David William Rollo,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Yes. It is into it. It is into it. Yes. Yes. Your recurring CapEx is into that number.
34,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,34,Jamie David William Rollo,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And my question on the STO. Actually, it was slightly different actually, but it was also, what's the exposure to owners being unable to pay? I mean that might come through as a working capital number. But what's your concern there, please?"
35,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,35,Jamie David William Rollo,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"We don't see that. We don't see that happening. I mean granted that, in fact, the people don't have a lot to pay either because this revenue has dropped significantly with the RevPAR being down, so that you know, but we don't see today people not paying us. It's something to be obviously monitored over time."
36,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,36,Operator,,,Our next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke of Bernstein.
37,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,37,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Three, if I may. Just first one, whether you could just update us on AccorInvest. Obviously, that's quite a leveraged asset-heavy entity that wasn't generating a lot of earnings last year. And what is the sort of financial situation there? Is there any situation where Accor would have to put any additional money into AccorInvest? Or does it have its own resources?"
38,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,38,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Second question, you mentioned sort of Huazhu and its responses in China. They've guided to 1% to 1.5% of permanent closures. Any thoughts on what the level of permanent closures might be in the Accor portfolio globally or just in China, if that's possible?"
39,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,39,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then just in terms of keeping those hotels open, I know that the Heartist Fund has got some amount that can go to owners. But what else would you be willing to do to sort of support the owners? Are you going to defer fees? Defer CapEx requirements? Is there any situation where you'll be willing to take stakes in the underlying hotels to support them staying open?"
40,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,40,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. So we'll go -- I'll go and then Jean-Jacques would pop in. And if Jean-Jacques goes, I'll pop in. On the AccorInvest, as you know, it's a privately-owned company in which we have a 30% stake and with some very large institutional shareholders. They, obviously, also prepared themselves for the worst. We do share all our estimates, numbers, projections, is communicated shared at the AccorInvest label, which is evident since we represent 99% of the brands of AccorInvest. They also have their own set of negotiations on thinking holidays from covenants with their own syndicate on the revolver line, which they have the benefit of. They've just restructured their debt when they put all this at the end of February. And they have access to government funding, either at the European Central Bank or at the different nations. So they have sufficient means to basically weather the storm until the end of the year on some very pessimistic scenario. And we just have our own dialogue with the set of investors on -- if it was to get worse, then we have a Board every 3 weeks with AccorInvest. But as of now, they have obtained sufficient outside financing with no need from the existing shareholder base."
41,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,41,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On other words, you're correct, Richard, on the -- [ Qi Ji ], Jenny and others are talking about the 1,000 to 1,500 hotels. But you could also say, on the other hand, they've also confirmed they're going to be opening 1,700 to 1,800 hotels in the same year. For us, the churn is not greater than we had last year."
42,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,42,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,No.
43,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,43,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Probably below that.
44,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,44,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Less than 2%.
45,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,45,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,Less than 2%.
46,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,46,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,So a good number.
47,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,47,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Again, I -- what we can't foresee is how many of those owners might not reopen because they might not have sufficient needs. That I can't tell you because we're not there yet. But we probably have to expect that hopefully a tiny part of them may not have the means or the will to reopen. But in absolutely no circumstances would we basically inject equity in those different owners, permitting them to be open. We are asset-light now, and we do go back asset heavy."
48,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,48,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. What about the question on deferring fees? I mean obviously, there's some -- you're expecting some loss in the..."
49,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,49,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. It's an ongoing discussion with Pierre Boisselier, Deputy CFO Treasurer, is working quite a bit with the heads of different regions. And of course, there is some cases in which some owners are asking for some postponement of existing fees. You're talking suddenly less than the EUR 100 million, EUR 150 million. It depends so much on a case-by-case basis."
50,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,50,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And it depends so much whether that person is an individual -- institution, sorry, or whether it is an individual. So it's -- Jean-Jacques could pop in. It's only starting."
51,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,51,Richard J. Clarke,"Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Again, here, I think the answer is unfortunately always the same. We are trying to answer on the basis of what we have in our hands, right? And so on the basis of what we have in our hands today, we don't see a lot of that happening. Now if you were to take a crazy scenario into which for 2 years, there is no hotel opened, you are in a totally different other discussion. And then this will come and ramp up for sure because it's an easy way using working capital to get funding between 2 partners. And so -- and by the then it's a situation that we will closely monitor."
52,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,52,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Monique Pollard of Citi.
53,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,53,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,Yes.
54,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,54,Monique Pollard,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Can you hear me?
55,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,55,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, we can."
56,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,56,Monique Pollard,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Just 3 for me, please. First one, a quick one. Of the 5.2% room openings that we had in 1Q year-on-year, could you tell me what proportion of that room's growth was Huazhu room? So what was the ex Huazhu room's growth that would be useful?"
57,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,57,Monique Pollard,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Secondly, could you give an update on your joint venture with -- on sbe? I know you were supposed to be refinancing the debt there, and that was going to materially improve the net income this year. I mean I don't know if that's already been done. Because if not, I imagine that would be challenging to look at right now."
58,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,58,Monique Pollard,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And then finally, a really helpful slide, 16, where you give the proportion of the guests that are domestic versus international. What I was trying to understand is in markets like China, where you're starting to see things open up and obviously without any international travel, does -- the hotels that were more focused on international, are they able to still attract domestic traffic as well?"
59,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,59,Monique Pollard,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Great question. So let's go first, Jean-Jacques on the first question on the Huazhu and..."
60,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,60,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The Huazhu, the number, it's about 30%."
61,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,61,Monique Pollard,"Citigroup Inc, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Got it.
62,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,62,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Okay. That's easy. On sbe, we told you for the last 4 months, I guess, all those nonconsolidated joint ventures are deemed to be consolidated and strategic. And we started with -- of course, with Mama Shelter with 25hours, and sbe is part of all the discussions. There's 2 discussions undergoing. There's one discussion on basically Mercure. I guess we expect all the debt covenants of sbe and all negotiation with existing junior debt, preferred debt, lenders of sbe that we know of, it's not -- no surprise here, that I guess, we are currently in the context of closing and signing. And then there is the ongoing discussions on taking full ownership or partial ownership of majority ownership from Sam Nazarian. But it's not done yet."
63,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,63,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"And then on domestic versus international. You -- Monique, you're absolutely correct. It is -- the greater -- if you go up the ladder, when you go from economy to luxury, in many cases, luxury hotels have higher international dependency. So it is true that, I guess, you'll have better results, better occupancy on the Ibis, Novotel, Mercure and likely Pullman of the world that I guess you will have on the Fairmont, Sofitel of the world. So as expected, and that was part of the question that Jaafar was asking, we're not accounting for any international clientele in the coming months since we're expecting the borders to remain close."
64,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,64,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Vicki Stern of Barclays.
65,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,65,Victoria Jane Lee Stern,Division,ANALYSTS,"I've got 3 questions. Just circling back on the fees you mentioned. I know it's, obviously, very early days, but some discussions around possibly deferring fees. Just curious -- I mean has it come up at all from any of the owners about actually reducing fees, so not just deferrals, but potentially sort of like sharing some of the pain through a lower, actually, contractual fee agreement?"
66,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,66,Victoria Jane Lee Stern,Division,ANALYSTS,"Secondly, just back on the balance sheet. Obviously, you noted your comments earlier. Just around the rating agencies there, I think they had in mind something like a 2.5 to 3.0x level that they have in mind for the investment-grade rating. Just can you comment on any discussions you might be having there? How we should think about that?"
67,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,67,Victoria Jane Lee Stern,Division,ANALYSTS,"And just then sort of back on the reopening. I guess hotels have reopened pretty quickly in China just despite quite low level scale of occupancy. Just how are you thinking about how owners would likely reopen the hotel? Obviously, there's a level of occupancy below which it just doesn't make any sense. Just I suppose, do you think it would look the same in other regions as we've seen in China in the sense of sort of phasing of reopening?"
68,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,68,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"It's -- you know what on -- as much as we've been having some discussion, as I've said and Jean-Jacques confirmed, that we don't have the magnitude of it yet where owners -- and again, it's so different in between different cases in different countries in which if they owe us any money and they are incapable of paying it from the last quarter of last year or the month of January and February in which they had occupancy, we're obviously sitting down with them and trying to find a solution. But as we said, tight cash is king. So whatever we do, the cash has to be not only bullet proof, but I guess we want and we will keep as much as we have because we need it."
69,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,69,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"In terms of reduction, no, it's not the case. It's absolutely not the case. I can tell you for a fact that I guess -- and it has to do with the ALL Heartist with what we do with the medics, how we make Accor available for those who need the most. It's never be a greater, better time for Accor in terms of brand positioning, in terms of values, in terms of engagement, in terms of local community connection, in terms of national health authorities. A lot of people don't want to leave the Accor family. They are extraordinarily proud of what Accor displays locally in the times where Accor is weak. So no, there's no discussions on reduction of fees from any sizable owners."
70,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,70,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On investment, I'll go back on the reopening and then Jean-Jacques will go on balance sheet and investment grade. On the -- Vicki, you're correct. And Chinese owners in America -- Chinese owners in China, sorry, yes, the 95% -- actually, 100% of them have decided to reopen their hotel independent from hoping for 40% occupancy. They know exactly what they're doing. They are pretty expert on their home market, and they decided to open."
71,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,71,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"You would see different behaviors, for sure, when it comes to North America, when it comes to certainly, France, for that matter, in which you will see probably some of the owners, if it's likely to be below 20%, I think they will not reopen. And that's okay because if -- that means lesser supply and better benefit for those who actually are daring more. But you'll see that in a much greater magnitude, Vicki, for a jurisdictions, many of them will not reopen either because they don't have the capacity or because they can't face having cash losses when we open. So we might be better off in that scenario."
72,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,72,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,On rating?
73,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,73,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Just on rating, I mean as you've certainly seen, I mean, the rating agency are very active lately. They have been looking at our industry, but they've been looking at many industries quite closely, and so we're talking to them. We'll talk to them about those results in the next 24 hours, giving them -- answering everything and making sure that they have all the information that is in our hand in order to make their best assessment."
74,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,74,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The only thing also that I can say on this one is that they revised the outlook -- S&P did revise the outlook. And again, it's public data, so I'm sure you've seen that, to negative for Accor in the last 30 days. And again, it's probably part of a more general process than everybody is going through lately, and I'm sure you've seen that many of our peers have been downgraded quite significantly. So we do talk to them, share, make sure that they have the best information, and then they do what they have to do."
75,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,75,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Just to add, and I guess, with the risk of being contradicted by Jean-Jacques, which is on my left here, is 90% plus of the facts being given to our rating agencies last 30 days when they've issued their opinion are still absolutely valid or correct, of no surprise. So 90% plus of all what we announced tonight, they knew all of it, including forecast for the rest of the year. So there is no excess negative news on what's being discussed tonight, and no surprises for them at all."
76,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,76,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean the difficulty, as you know, is not so much the current year, it's how fast will it rebound and how it will rebound because again the assessment which is done is not a sparse assessment. I mean the rating agency, much smarter than that, and they look at the global perspective, obviously. And so perhaps the difficulty that we all have, i.e., how is this situation going to improve, how fast is it going to improve and recover."
77,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,77,Operator,,,Our next caller is Dan Wasiolek of Morningstar.
78,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,78,Dan Wasiolek,"Morningstar Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Kind of more of a maybe longer-term structural question here, but I don't know if you've been having conversations maybe with executives in kind of assessing if there might be any long-term change to corporate travel demand just given the shelter ends globally and maybe people getting more accustomed to using video conferencing. Just maybe any thoughts that you guys are having around corporate travel long term."
79,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,79,Dan Wasiolek,"Morningstar Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,And then any numbers maybe around group booking cancellations and rebook trends for maybe later this year or in 2021?
80,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,80,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"It's -- I'll answer, it's easier, on the group booking. It's one of the area where you have the largest uncertainty. It's not really on when country is going to be deconfining, which is likely to be between May same countries reopening for business, they will still have Draconian limitation. On groups, we don't know what is the number, and the number will vary in between jurisdictions. But it could be as low as 50, and it could be, obviously, a couple of hundred or 300, which means -- and that could be for a period that we don't know of, what could be another 6 months, could be until year-end. So any, what we call, mice business in large corporate, banqueting venues and facilities is the one in which you have the largest unknown and in which you have to prepare for the worst because it's, obviously, the ones that's going to be the most impacted. That's not a big niche of Accor, but you have to be mindful of this."
81,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,81,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The second question, which is why the first, that one is much more difficult. I -- you have to rethink, you have to reassess your business model, your client's population by age, by nature, whether it's corporate travel, whether it's leisure, whether it's domestic, whether international because things will change. No question. The one thing I'm not buying is you may see people traveling less because they get accustomed to be far more efficient working from home and probably limit the necessity to travel, which, obviously, has an impact on corporate travel. I -- anybody has been telling me they get -- people get accustomed to video conference, and everything is going to do by video. I heard that for the last 12 years I've been in business. God knows 10 times with the same nature, people being vocal after September 11, after terrorist attack, after SARS, after Ebola. That play has been served to me so many times. It might be more impactful this time, but not on this one. I don't buy. Anybody you can talk to are telling you that the level of concentration on video, on a conference call is twice greater and you're missing all the body language. And when it comes to negotiations, it's mostly impossible to negotiate any large transaction negotiation by video conference call. So I'll be more bullish on this one. But I can't tell you. I give us the benefit of the 12 months passing to get a better granularity on this."
82,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,82,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Jarrod Castle of UBS.
83,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,83,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Three as well. Maybe one for you, Jean-Jacques. You're obviously putting in place a lot of measures. Will some of that go through an exceptional line? Are you thinking in terms of putting through an exceptional item?"
84,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,84,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Secondly, you're obviously in crisis mode, but any thoughts in terms of..."
85,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,85,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,[Technical Difficulty]
86,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,86,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"You're being cut off, Jarrod"
87,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,87,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Medium term. I mean
88,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,88,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,[Technical Difficulty]
89,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,89,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,Is that a bit better?
90,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,90,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,It is better. Can take -- start again. Medium term?
91,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,91,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Yes. So your medium-term target for 2022, I take it that will be revised. But any kind of thinking in terms of opportunities and kind of medium-term strategy?"
92,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,92,Jarrod Castle,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"And I guess slightly linked to that, I mean would Accor be open to opportunities in terms of M&A that might or might not arise?"
93,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,93,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"I'll answer quickly, and I have to apologize if there's any further questions for me because I need to jump on a different conference call with the health authorities in France. So sorry to do that on you."
94,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,94,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"On the -- Jarrod, the -- on medium-term 2022, we simply don't know. Going back to Jaafar question, I -- we are preparing for the worst. It's going to be longer than 6 months. It could be 18 months. It could be 3 years. But I am a half-full optimist guy. Market will recover. The tourism industry is absolutely not dead. It's probably going to be working differently. But coming, hopefully, for me, end of 2022, we will be back at a reasonable level of 2019. It could be 10% or 20% below. But I'm a bit more optimist. But it's going to take that much time to go back to where we are. And again, with the risk of being wrong, but I guess I'm going to be planning for greater market penetration."
95,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,95,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"The reason why I say that is if you believe Accor is impacted, wait until you see all our -- not our peers, but wait until you see the industry at large in terms of ability to the tens of thousands of existing supply hoteliers not being able to respond and not being able to survive. So the cards are entirely reshuffled in the entire industry of travel and tourism. That's true for car rental, airlines, hoteliers, bar, café, restaurant, museum. You know it, and I know it. So too soon. But of course, you'd better watch what's happening around you. And Accor has the size, the skill, the talent to navigate in those troubled waters."
96,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,96,Sébastien M. Bazin,Chairman & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"When it comes to M&A, no, we're not open. We're digging with discipline, prudence, cautiousness. That time may come, but it's certainly not now."
97,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,97,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. And in terms of the exceptional item that you may have here, I mean one of the good thing in that crisis and that slide that Sébastien showed on all the governmental actions which have been taken and that's really helpful because basically, it helps us being subsidized on keeping the employee on our payroll, which is the best, I would say, recipe to be able to rebound. So there is no major restructuring plan that we need to account for or something like that at this stage. I think that's one element."
98,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,98,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And then the other element that could be going your way is, do I need to do any kind of write-off or of significant revision? I'm not at that stage. I think we need to go and let a little bit more of the year flow through. And when we're going to be in the second part of the year, we'll have much more visibility on what is the future and then readapt all the business plan of all the things that are on the balance sheet. Today, there is nothing that I can foresee."
99,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,99,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,And our final caller is [ Luigi ] of Wells Fargo.
100,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,100,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"My first question would be on the way hotels are operating in China, and it would be interesting to hear if there are like new procedures or higher level of deep cleaning, some sort of new things you need to do or cost you need to have to operate hotels, and that you could -- we could see here in Europe as well when the hotels reopen."
101,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,101,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,And the second question is if you would consider not paying the coupons on the hybrid bonds to save additional cash.
102,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,102,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"I mean the second answer is no. So that's clear. I have the balance sheet that we described, and the last thing I want is to go those kind of routes. So no."
103,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,103,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And then as far as the measures, yes, you mean. You may have seen that we want, and we've been we've been working on developing a certification with other hotelier in France on what is required in the new world in order to make sure that you've got safety level which are increased. So it means the masking, the gloves, getting some cleanup of all the surfaces with an increased rhythm. It also means limiting the physical contact and much more using your phone in order to do things. It means being able to capture the temperature of the people entering and going out. So all of that is ongoing, and you should see things coming up on that subject in the coming weeks. I mean we are working on developing those procedure. But you're absolutely right. There will be at least that change coming from that crisis going forward in our businesses because people are much more conscious today of the washing your hands that you've signed -- that you've seen for 100 years in the kitchen and that were never really fully applied by everybody in the world. And I'm not talking our industry. I'm talking in generic term, my kids and so on. So that's where we are. Anyway -- go, sorry, sir."
104,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,104,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"No, sorry. Maybe just a very quick follow-up. And is there any service you may not be able to provide within hotels like room service or food?"
105,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,105,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"The portion which is the most difficult is the one where you've got physical contact, obviously. So food is the one where you need to probably rethink how you dispose the tables, how you do the service and things. Sébastien was alluding to that before. But it's part also of the pleasure of people going to hotel than to be able to have a good dinner, and so we'll have to figure out a different way of doing things, but I personally don't foresee that this is something that people are going to forgo."
106,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,106,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Understood, understood. And maybe very, very quick one, last one for me."
107,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,107,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"And in your talks with the -- with your owners around the world, what sort of -- I mean how is the leverage situation of all those owners? I appreciate that, obviously, a lot of different situations. But what sort of leverage levels you see with the owners?"
108,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,108,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"That's a very wide question. What I would say is that in the owner, you've got various categories of people. You've got several in France, and they don't really have problems. And then you've got -- or much less. And then you've got France, VCs, or private equity and these kind of things, which again have a much different situation than the one who are struggling the most, which are the very small franchise. So the people who are struggling today are the people who have the smallest, I would say, financial surface, people who own 1 hotel or 2 hotels and not necessarily the best-performing hotels in the world. So these are the people that struggle the most."
109,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,109,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,This concludes today's question and answer. I will turn the call over to your host.
110,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,110,Jean-Jacques Morin,Deputy CEO & CFO,EXECUTIVES,"Thank you. So I think we're done. So thank you very much again for your time, for your questions. And hopefully, we've helped you understand better our business, and we look forward meeting you and talking to you -- meeting you, I don't know, but talking to you for sure for H1, and I would love that I will be able to meet you all. Bye-bye."
111,"Accor SA, Q1 2020 Sales Trading Statement Call, Apr 22, 2020",QA,111,Operator,,,"Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Hosts, please stay connected."
