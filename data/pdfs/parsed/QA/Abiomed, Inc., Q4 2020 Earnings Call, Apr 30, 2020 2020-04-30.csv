0,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.
1,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,1,Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,"William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"First one for me is just a little bit of a follow-up on the COVID-19 comments you made. So can you give us a sense of the impact of COVID-19 on the referral networks for high risk PCI cases, because it does sound like cases are down 45%. But I guess, does it get better from here just as patients come back into certain facilities and get tested? Or is there a little bit of a gap period between that time?"
2,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,2,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Margaret, thanks for the call. So I would answer that in a 3 phase component. So currently Red, the referrals aren't happening because the cath labs and surgical suites are essentially closed down at many of these centers that are hardest hit, areas like New York, Detroit. And what we've seen is that many of the intervention cardiologists and surgeons, especially the younger ones, are treating patients in the ICU and all the ICU beds in overwhelmed areas are full."
3,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,3,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"From a referral perspective, the delays that have been happening, where people are not showing up in hospitals with chest pain, will continue to build. And what you've also seen is by all the societies, cardiovascular societies, is differentiating cardiovascular disease as not truly being elective, right? There's a difference between somebody having chest pain and having a PCI versus someone having an orthopedic procedure. So that's the first component."
4,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,4,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"The second is they've already started national campaigns, and this is happening as well in Europe, to advise the general public to seek medical support if they're having chest pain or other heart failure conditions. So we're in the Red Phase now. There are certain pockets of the country now where those guidelines are opening up. So they're starting the Yellow Phase. We think that progresses to the end of the summer, and then we expect it to go back open by the time we get to the second half of our fiscal year."
5,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,5,Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,"William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. So it sounds maybe the 45%, hard to know. I know you guys aren't setting guidance, but maybe that's a a worst-case scenario and maybe gets better, like you said, as you go through that Yellow Phase and the Green Phase and so on?"
6,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,6,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Correct. And we're trying to prepare for every worst-case scenario, but we do believe that the early weeks of April and the end of March were really the most severe, and that's why we're really focused on sequential growth weekly as we end the Q1."
7,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,7,Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,"William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then just 1 more in terms of the acquisition of Breethe. You referenced the 10% of cases that maybe could be good candidates. Can you walk us through what you expect that mix of Impella and ECPELLA to look like, let's say, 5 years from now? And how do you think clinicians will approach these to the device between now and then?"
8,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,8,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Good question. So thanks for the the comment on ECMO. Currently, we're about 10% of our patients get ECPELLA for us, and that's what's represented in the IQ database. We also believe that when you combine unloading with oxygenation, you get better outcomes, which is why many of our physicians, over the years, have asked us to add it. And there's multiple publications that we've referenced in the press release, demonstrating that ECPELLA, so a patient in shock that requires both hemodynamics and oxygenation, ECPELLA gets better outcomes than ECMO only, and that's well documented over the years."
9,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,9,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"What I would say that, in the next 5 years, we're going to continue to innovate. And because we combine the technologies, and we've got the world's smallest heart pumps, and we can do left and right side support, you're going to see real new innovation come to that space. This COVID-19 time has shown that many of the technologies that are out there for oxygenation and hemodynamics are already 20 years old and they're 510(k) technology. So they haven't been put through PMA safe and effective process. And so we're going to bring that same discipline in innovation, the integration of our waveforms, integration of what's happening in these patients, and we'll be able to optimize both oxygenation and unloading because the end game and goal is to keep the patient alive and send him or her home with their own heart, like the case example I gave of the 43-year-old woman."
10,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,10,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.
11,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,11,Rajbir Singh Denhoy,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I wonder if, Mike -- maybe I could start with what you -- the comments you made around early March as you were still recovering from the AHA issues from last year, you noted that you were starting to see some growth. And so I'm curious what was actually happening, if you could provide some more detail about what was perhaps resonating, what was starting to turn the corner with some of these accounts that maybe had pushed back on Impella initially?"
12,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,12,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, Raj. So the 2 misleading papers went to print, but that also gave us an opportunity to further analyze them and educate the community. So starting with -- we just looked at the data, the validity of that information. We were able to acquire the information for the Amin paper and have insight into that. There's a reason that the outcomes weren't given, just odds ratios because they were essentially the same and there were sicker patients in the Impella population, which is what we expected."
13,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,13,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We also have evaluated the other paper for the exact time period in the IQ database and shown that patients that got Impella before the PCI had better outcomes. And the JAMA paper mixed in bail out over a year, that's had been submitted to the FDA showing that we get better outcomes and optimize safety and effectiveness for patients in shock when you put the Impella in before the PCI. And we reiterated all the papers and publications that are out there from better and more robust databases to demonstrate that, which includes also NCSI. And and then one other paper had come along that was generated by multiple centers, but the first author and senior offer were from Cleveland Clinic, again, showing that if you do a better job with high-risk PCI with Impella, you get better outcomes and you also reduce length of stay."
14,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,14,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So that also was published. These last 6 months has been an exciting component of production of new papers. And what you'll see for the next 6 to 10 months is a slew of papers coming out for high-risk PCI for shock, and it's really being generated and done by our best users that have already been publishing their data. And so I think you're going to see, over the next 6 months, really the validation that Impella supporting high-risk PCI enables better outcomes, and that's kind of the component of what CAMP is about. It's optimizing the PCI that achieves higher EF post procedure. You're not doing the PCI to do a PCI. You're doing the PCI so that you can have the patients see an improvement in EF. And you're going to consistently continue to see real data from sites that are doing it today, getting better outcomes in cardiogenic shock. So that's been very helpful."
15,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,15,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"We also use the opportunity to explain the history of all the studies. And I think one of the benefits of CAMP and doing these user meetings is be able to put in front of our user base, the history of Impella from 2006 to 2020, all the FDA data, all the existing post-approval studies and really demonstrate that this is the most studied heart pump in the history of the FDA as well as what we're competing with are technologies that are 20-plus years old that don't have a single FDA study. And so I think the credibility, and most important, the fact that these physicians can refer back to patients that they've sent back to the referring community, the referring physicians that have better outcomes and improvement in EF is really what we, again, validated our story and provided that momentum back."
16,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,16,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"I can I just that up on the roadshows? Yes. Raj, just quickly, too. I think 1 of the things we highlighted last call that we would be conducting some roadshows in February and early March. And we hit 7 cities anywhere from Dallas to Minneapolis. And I would say it was all about clarifying, educating and really just kind of displaying our future innovation and clinical road maps. And we track the attendance for those roadshows and then the utilization before and the utilization after. And we started seeing some traction from those roadshows. Unfortunately, they got cut a little bit short because of COVID-19, but some of those road shows we're starting to pay a little bit of dividends as well from a patient utilization perspective."
17,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,17,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"And the intent of CAMP PCI is to make that roadshow online in a password-protective environment, where physicians are presenting to other physicians. And as part of that community, the user base can ask questions and get -- received responses on an ongoing basis on any subject."
18,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,18,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Right, right. So I had a couple of questions on COVID as well. And I guess the first once is sort of related to that, though. So now that we're in this period where you can't directly engage with physicians one-on- one, how are you now transitioning that in a sense? And do you think you'll be as effective in education and overcoming some of these misperceptions, perhaps, that's now that you can't engage directly with physicians one-on-one?"
19,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,19,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So Raj, we feel fortunate because we're already planning for Abiomed 2.0. You all have heard us talk about this over the last several earnings calls. So SmartAssist and Impella Connect gives us that real- time connection to physicians while the patients on support. It lets us all communicate. CAMP PCI was already in process, and the faculty has already been selected. They've actually been here to headquarters for multiple meetings, which now we're launching. We implemented Skype over 18 months ago globally, and we automated our finance and customer center."
20,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,20,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So we talk to physicians quite regularly now on Skype, on calls. We've been incredibly productive on working on PROTECT IV. We've already selected our Executive Committee. We've selected the country leaders and the technical committee. And we've been, frankly, using the time and the new tools that are out there that have made us very effective. I personally -- I conduct Facetime or Skype calls each week with multiple physicians. And as Seth mentioned, we have 200-plus people calling in every Friday. So Seth, maybe you could comment on your interaction."
21,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,21,Seth Bilazarian,Chief Medical Officer,EXECUTIVES,"Yes, I think that that's all true, what Mike summarized. But what I'd add is that for the last several years, we've really been building our digital assets with protectedpci.com, a variety of video and other educational platforms. The growth, last year was exponential well before COVID-19 with our recently introduced Frequently Asked Questions page to really help clarify utilization issues, raising awareness about the product in our therapeutic areas. So that's already been in place. Of course, we expect to expand it and enrich it with CAMP and have it be not open to the public, but be protected -- password- protected environment. So I think that we are well positioned. It is -- there isn't anything like sitting with a person, but we think that we're well positioned to be in a remote virtual environment for education and interaction with our physician customers. We've also -- Mike, if I just make 1 more comment is that, we are well along and expect in this quarter to demo our first use of virtual proctoring. We'll be able to use technology platforms with a remote proctor to essentially be standing by virtually in the cath lab with a physician to step-by-step instruct the physician on any areas about the use of Impella or our a protected PCI case. So so that was already also underway before COVID-19, and we will be demonstrating that in the next 4 to 6 weeks."
22,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,22,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Understood. Maybe -- and my last 1 was just a clarification. So the 45% fall off you saw in April, was that equally balanced between high-risk PCI and shock? Or did you see a heavier fall off in one or the other?"
23,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,23,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"It's heavier in high-risk PCI. And then it gets lower when you start getting into the shock patients. However, in many of these cities, cardiac arrest patients weren't necessarily being resuscitated or weren't necessarily being taken to emergency rooms. And unfortunately, some of them that did get to the emergency rooms didn't get further treatment. Door to balloon time, which is how fast you get from the ER to the cath labs, has more than tripled in most cases, and many patients just get lytics or blood thinners and sit in the ER or because they don't have the ability to treat them. So it's a tough time for many out there, but it's going to come back. But that's why the elective cases get hit. But overall, everything is down when the cath labs and surgical suites aren't being utilized."
24,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,24,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim.
25,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,25,Christopher Thomas Pasquale,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I wanted to start with making sure I understand the Red, Yellow, Green progression. So is the right way the plan actually assume for procedure activity in the Green phase? Are you baking in any sort of catch-up from lost cases or just sort of back to pre-COVID levels?"
26,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,26,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So Chris, thanks for the question. That's the plan. Now if Red extends past Q1, we'll extend our plan of attack for Q1. If we start to see it ramp a little faster, which we hope to start seeing each week now, then we'll get to our Yellow phase earlier. I can't put an exact week or month on it, but that's the way we see things progression. And we've already seen some signal right now in the last week with some of the new parameters that have been put in place to treat elective procedures."
27,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,27,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"In the back half, Green, we do expect that there will be a little bit of catch-up, but we also know that there's going to be limited time or space in the cath labs. But we're also excited because, on top of all those things, we now have new patients that we'll be able to treat. So the 5.5 full launch is happening. We think we're going to see a little bit of a rebound in the Impella RP. And by the end of fiscal '21, we expect to be piloting and starting with ECMO. So these will all be better products, new patients and also adding in those patients requiring oxygenation."
28,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,28,Christopher Thomas Pasquale,"Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,And then I appreciate visibility is unusually poor right now. So I'm not surprised at all by the decision to pass on giving guidance. But can you share any color on how you were thinking about what FY '21 would look like prior to the world changing in the past 6 weeks?
29,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,29,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. I mean, it's a good question, Chris. I mean, obviously, we're coming off of a Q4, where we had some noise around the 2 misleading publications, I think we started seeing, as I mentioned, some positive momentum in March, given some of the initiatives that we laid out. And so again, up until March, we were seeing 11% growth in U.S. patient utilization. So as we thought about next year, we're excited about some of the things that Mike highlighted. We had the 5.5 launch, we had the expandable sheath coming in the fourth quarter, we're launching CAMP, all these online interactive training curriculums. So we felt we we're going to set up for a pretty solid fiscal year '21 based on kind of what we see -- what we were seeing exiting Q4 and all the initiatives that we had on the place -- on our plate."
30,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,30,Operator,,,Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink.
31,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,31,Danielle Joy Antalffy,"SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I have 2 questions. Just one, sorry to belabor the COVID point, Mike and Todd. But just curious about, from a recovery perspective, I mean, I get, and I appreciate the commentary around the different phases. But logistically, like how are you thinking about the ability for hospitals to recover some of these procedures? And do you expect any procedures to sort of be lost? Unfortunately, some of these patients might parish or drop out of the system somehow? How should we be thinking about that V shapes, U shaped a little more color there? And then 1 follow-up on the ECMO, the Breethe acquisition?"
32,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,32,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Danielle, thanks for the question. On the recovery, logistically, we think it's going to be different around the country. And so that's why we're managing and watching and have access to all the patients in the different parts of both Europe, Germany and the U.S. and less of an impact in Japan. Relative to what happens with the delay. Unfortunately, these patients, some of them may not have made it through this"
33,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,33,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"COVID crisis. However, there's going to be a large population of people now that are sicker and worse off. There is going to be some carry forward for those patients that likely need some type of support. And we also know that, in some cases, they are trying to go with the least invasive approach, meaning that not patients that may have in the past got -- who have gotten open heart surgery, CABG, may opt for something less invasive that'll allow them to go in and out of the hospital within a day or 2."
34,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,34,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So those are the trends we're watching. And I do think that heart failure, coronary disease was already the #1 killer. COVID-19 will have a negative impact, overall, because it attacks the lungs, but also those that get really sick, it impacts them. And we likely will see myocarditis and cardiomyopathy increase over time as well."
35,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,35,Danielle Joy Antalffy,"SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then just really quickly on breethe, I mean that acquisition makes a ton of sense to me, congrats on that. Just curious about how that could position you from a sales perspective? I mean, is there an opportunity to, I don't know if bundling is the right word, but sort of drive sales synergies? I mean, there's a lot of centers, the ones with the AHA presentations that prefer ECMO. So is there an opportunity for you guys to leverage and get into those centers in a bigger way with the Impella as well?"
36,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,36,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So to be clear, the leaders in this space of circulatory support and those that have published most of the data, are our existing customers. There certainly are some people that still use balloon pumps. And I'd qualify the sites that produce the paper or balloon pump users and big ECMO users. However, the technology for ECMO has an absolute role for oxygenation. And yes, we believe there's great synergy, not just in the distribution and in our organization to collect the data, but also in approving outcomes. It's one thing to have somebody survive, it's another thing to have them survived and you've them discharged to home with their native heart. And the optimization and the information that we have learned with Impella itself will really allow us to even leapfrog into ECPELLA. And remember, every time we leapfrog this technology with a new breakthrough, we file more IP, which currently stands at 850 patents and over 700 pending. So we will continue to innovate in this space, and you'll likely see us transform that treatment to make it easier to improve survival, but also maximize and optimize native heart recovery."
37,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,37,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.
38,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,38,Matthew Oliver O'Brien,"Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Mike, to your point about less folks coming in right now because of fear of COVID. We've been hearing a lot about that as well. More structural damage is going to be caused as a result of this to these patients. So kind of 2 questions in 1 here. When do you think these patients will start presenting, is this second half of this year? And when they do present, given all the damage that they're causing to their heart, are they going to be more complicated patients to treat? So you're going to see more either use of CP, biventricular, 5.5? How do we think about potentially addressing this patient population that's coming in with more damage to their heart muscle?"
39,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,39,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So Matt, that is the theory. We believe that will play out. It's unfortunate for many patients that that's going to happen. One of the great things about having Impella Connect, having the largest field distribution team, and also having Impella Connect ramping up is that we have really great visibility to every hospital, every physician and we already have a network with the call center. So we know when patients are getting supported. If you're an Impella Connect site, if the patient goes on, it's in the cloud, that are out there. Yes, they're going to be sicker and more complicated. And as I said, we've already seen the impact, a little bit, of some sequential growth with the announcements that elective procedures are opening back up as well as the media approach that the CV, cardiovascular societies, have taken recently. So we want to be there to help our patients. But we only want to help patients that it's appropriate. And that's why when we do the COVID-19 calls on Fridays, we really 0 in on the areas that we can help. And all of the patients that we've seen so far have benefited from either the Impella RP, Impella CP or the Impella 5.5. And so we're excited to have the opportunity to step in here with this crisis. But we also know that there's some tough times ahead, and there's going to be a lot more sick people with heart failure."
40,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,40,Matthew Oliver O'Brien,"Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. That's helpful. And then the expandable sheath commentary, I thought was really positive. Can you talk about how the interaction with FDA has gone? Do you feel really comfortable with the mission timing and potential approval? And then any sense for when you may get the CP you may just submit for CP? And then again, bundled within that, I think if there's a fair number of doctors that are waiting for that specifically. Can you kind of trying to quantify some of the conversations you've had over the years as far as what that may do to the business as you get those products later this year and into next year?"
41,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,41,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Sure. So we feel blessed that we have the ability to have so much innovation and have the balance sheet to continue to move forward. If you think about our plan of what we are already doing, this year, we're going to accelerate it. So if we thought maybe Impella Connect would take 3 years, we're going to try to get it all done this year. And we're staying on track with all of our new products and submissions. So I do want to complement the FDA. As a little company, we probably have a ton of submissions in there for both new products or new studies, or post-approval studies, and they've been seamless and efficient. And they've done reviews with us online and in real time. And so we feel very good where we are. The expandable sheath. Remember, we've already done 16-plus patients, and we feel great about it. The submission is going to go in for 510(k) in Q2 for 2.5. That's a 90-day submission at max, and we'll follow it shortly after with -- for the CP. For the ECP, we are going to plan. It's the submission went in yesterday. So we'll be doing patients in the U.S. in the early feasibility study for high-risk PCI and we're excited and hope to have that by the end of the summer or the beginning of the second half. And that's another breakthrough technology that's 9-French, 3-plus liters. There's nothing like it. But the intent for all of these technologies is that we'll be able to close the femoral hole with a 9-French closure device. And that's a game changer, and that's really going to help us with our training data in time."
42,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,42,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
43,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,43,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,This is Calvin on behalf of David. 2 quick ones from me. Could you please just provide some more detail on the methodology that you used to quantify the $17 million COVID impact for the quarter? Was this an estimate based on the run rate of the first 2.5 months and then applying that run rate to the quarter? Or is this a geography based approach as well? Any color you can provide there would be helpful. And I have a quick follow-up.
44,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,44,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Good. Thanks for your question, Calvin. So yes, what we did is we just took the patient run rate through May 14. So the first 2 weeks of -- I'm sorry, March 14, and we just kind of extrapolated that out for the rest of the quarter. And I said, if those -- the performance we saw in the first 2 weeks of March continued, we would have seen x amount from a patient perspective and then averaged -- used an average selling over in Europe."
45,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,45,Unknown Analyst,,ANALYSTS,"Understood. And the second question is just, do you intend to run clinical trials around the ECPELLA therapy in the future? And just can you comment on the strategic trajectory for that therapy going forward?"
46,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,46,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, Calvin. The -- in the press release we did last night, we actually put 3 studies and publication that are already in process. The next phase of this we'll really be starting to integrate the waveforms, things we can do with SmartAssist, where you can time the Impella, you can look at the waveform and predict recoverability, and you can also match it with the oxygenation needs of the patient. So one example of what we're already doing with our AI for SmartAssist, is we look at waveforms and we can determine whether or not we can predict right heart failure, or we look at waveforms for the last 5 to 10 minutes on a patient, and we can predict the next 5 or 10 minutes of what's going to happen to the patient's hemodynamics, which is critical if you're doing a high-risk PCI and you're thinking about explanting the device and sending it to the patient with ICU, or if you're just treating a patient in the ICU and you want to recover them. So there'll be a lot more that can come. But again, the Impella technology, combined with ECMO, gives a whole new capability in treating patients, as before, you really didn't have smart devices, and you really weren't able to evaluate what's happening with the myocardium for the patient in the ICU."
47,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,47,Operator,,,We'll take our next question from Chris Cooley from Stephens.
48,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,48,Christopher Cook Cooley,"Stephens Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Mike and Todd, I just want to congratulate you guys on the brief transaction. And I know we'll probably hear more about this at the upcoming Investor Day, but I'd appreciate if you could maybe elaborate a little bit more here regarding your views, maybe competitively on low flow, and more specifically below 2 liters. Just when we think about ECMO in general and the complications associated with that, how you potentially see the Breathe device? Obviously, you have a favorable view of it there, but how you see that versus other competing technologies, and more specifically from the low flow versus high flow rate? Then I've got a follow-up."
49,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,49,Christopher Cook Cooley,"Stephens Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Chris, could you just clarify the low flow comment? What specifically you're referring to?"
50,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,50,Christopher Cook Cooley,"Stephens Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,Sure. Just the flow rates there basically sub 2 liters?
51,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,51,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"So just to clarify, make sure I understand. So the ECMO flow, if you do smaller cannula and you do it through the peripheral, you can get a limitation for some of these. You'll see that it's 2, 2.5. You'll also see the trend at many of these centers has been to go smaller cannula with less flow with the thought process, they can get better outcomes because you weren't completely overloading the heart. Right? You -- ECMO perfuses the body at the expense of the heart. The devices can run-up to 5 liters plus, as can the Breethe, but if you do that for too long, you're essentially -- you're going to over stress and overwork the native heart, which is going to cause a larger infarct. And so what you'd end up with, in some cases, the patient that has survived but now has to go on to a transplant. And what our focus is in this technology is really patient, and plan out a strategy where you're weaning off ECMO and you're weaning off Impella together. So you're treating not just the body, but the heart with the ultimate goal to recover. So you'll see more of this -- the details on this. Dr. Bart Griffith is a pioneer in the space. This has been his life's work. I've worked with them for over 8 years, and we've invested in this type of platform and technology now for the last 2 years. So we've been very focused on adding this to our portfolio. This process started 2 years ago. And as I stated, we already had plans to do this, and feel that now is the best time to have ECMO directly in our portfolio, especially with an increase in these respiratory acute failures."
52,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,52,Christopher Cook Cooley,"Stephens Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Understood. Appreciate the color. And then just lastly for me. I know if it's again challenging, to say the least and looking ahead. But when we think about the 3 phases, Red, Yellow and Green, when we think about the Yellow Phase, am I correct to assume that as you're exiting the Yellow Phase, you're seeing positive volume growth? Or is this -- I'm just trying to -- want to make sure I kind of understand the parameters around the transition from Yellow to Green. Is that a -- going flat? Just trying to get a better feel for kind of how you're defining the Yellow Phase?"
53,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,53,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Sure, Chris. That's a great question because we're talking about sequential growth from March and April. And at some point, that will start to cross over where you're looking at positive growth year-over-year. And so that's a great question."
54,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,54,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"It's too soon to tell you that specific. Right now, for Q1, it's really on sequential growth over the last month, over the last week. But we do expect when we get back to the second half, to be net positive. That's what we would consider to be Green. But again, we're similar to all the other companies that are out there, that are waiting to see how the hospitals respond. We do feel that our patients are sicker. Our elective cases are truly not elective like having cosmetic surgery or knees, they're still having heart failure. Many of them are still being admitted to the hospital with acute on chronic. And we do expect, unfortunately, for many people, coronary disease is going to grow, and we think that, with COVID-19, it's going to grow even more. And so it's our job to be prepared as this ramps back up and we get into the positive. But what you'll see as we go along and you'll see each quarters, we'll give you full transparency to that number, just like we did today, and we'll give you full transparency throughout the year."
55,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,55,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.
56,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,56,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I hope everyone is safe. Just a couple quick questions here. The down 45% from mid-March through April, is that a worldwide number? Or was that in reference to the U.S.? If it is worldwide, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the U.S., if it is different?"
57,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,57,Todd A. Trapp,CFO & VP,EXECUTIVES,"Jason, it's a good question. I would say the 45% to 50% for halfway through March through April was a worldwide number. As you can imagine, we were seeing most of that impact in, I would say, the U.S. as well as in Europe. Although we did start seeing a little bit more softness in Japan, but it's predominantly a Europe and U.S. number."
58,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,58,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And just on the international business, growth slowed a bit, and I fully understand that the COVID dynamic. But I think you mentioned an impact in Germany from the publications. That doesn't feel like combat the negative messaging from those publications?"
59,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,59,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Jason, it was essentially the same approach in Germany. And I think we did see benefit as well of just -- education helps clarify any of the misperceptions, and we have a very good German physician base and we continue the same actions that we did in the U.S."
60,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,60,Jayson Tyler Bedford,"Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division",ANALYSTS,And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Mike Minogue for any closing remarks.
61,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,61,Michael R. Minogue,"Chairman, CEO & President",EXECUTIVES,"Thank you, everyone, for taking the time today, and we're happy to follow-up with any questions that ask for more detail. Be safe, and have a great day."
62,"Abiomed, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2020",QA,62,Operator,,,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."
