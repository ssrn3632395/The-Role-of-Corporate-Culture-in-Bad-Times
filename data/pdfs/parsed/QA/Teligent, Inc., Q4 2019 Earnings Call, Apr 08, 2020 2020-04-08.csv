0,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,0,Operator,,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.
1,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,1,Matthew Gregory Hewitt,"Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Tim, welcome. Nice to hear from you this morning. I've got a few questions. Maybe the first that you could start with is, what attracted you to this opportunity? Where do you see the near-term low-hanging fruit? And how quickly do you think you can capitalize on that?"
2,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,2,Timothy B. Sawyer,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Thanks. So I think a couple of things. First, what attracted me to the opportunity obviously, you heard a bunch about headwinds and things today, but what attracted me to the opportunity specifically, is the product portfolio and the injectables transition that the company had was under -- that was undergoing at the time that I joined. I think injectables are a critical component to the medical treatment protocol. I think that they are an area where there is lots of opportunity, particularly as you've seen in the marketplace with drug shortages, if you track that area. So I think that was very, very interesting to me. And I think that the ability of this company to launch into that market is really exciting. So that's the first part. The second part, what do I see as low-hanging fruit? I think the first thing that we did and are doing is improving our product supply. So one of the things that this company was burdened with previously was, they were unable to be a reliable supplier for customers. And customers demanded that in this marketplace, not being an intermittent supplier, and that causes lumps in your sales, lumps in your earnings. And so we've undertaken a comprehensive plan to overhaul our supply chain and our processes for how we work and forecast and predict our business going forward. So that's -- the first thing is to become a reliable supplier for our customers, and that will pay off in dividends when our customers see us as such and are able to rely on us day in and day out when we become their first tier call when they're looking for new products. So I think that's an area of low-hanging fruit for us. And I think I might have forgotten what your -- third part of your question was."
3,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,3,Matthew Gregory Hewitt,"Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"No. That's perfect. You touched on one of the things. So as you look at getting the injectables facility up and approved by the FDA, one of the opportunities with the first drug that was submitted was that it was the -- or to trigger the inspection, is that your plan with that second submission is to find an opportunity where it's a drug that either is currently on shortage or has the history of being on shortage? Or maybe even there's an opportunity within something within the coronavirus treatments where there's a need and a demand that would trigger the FDA to maybe come in sooner rather than later?"
4,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,4,Timothy B. Sawyer,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"Yes. So good question. So what we're looking at, the second product, obviously, will be filed here shortly. It doesn't have a shortage currently. However, as a part of an NDA and it's a pre-approval supplement, as I mentioned, what's going -- what will happen is there's a statutory time line that the FDA has to come in and inspect for, so -- because they have to respond to the agent, to the supplement within certain number of months. So number one, this product allows us to push a faster track on that. Number two, we are always -- and what you mentioned is important, we are always looking for opportunities to accelerate the time line. And if there are COVID-19 related ways to do that, we will pursue them rigorously to work with the agency to get -- to accelerate that approval for the facility."
5,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,5,Matthew Gregory Hewitt,"Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Okay. And then -- and I don't know if you know the answer to this, but I thought I'd ask it anyway. Given the situation with the country right now, are there -- are you hearing anecdotally any issues with the FDA conducting inspections? I know that they're considered obviously an essential business, and they're still going to work. But is that slowing down the inspection process in any way that you've heard?"
6,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,6,Timothy B. Sawyer,President & CEO,EXECUTIVES,"They have made a couple of announcements at the agency about delaying inspections of certain particular types. We believe that -- quite frankly, we believe that with what's going on with this pandemic, the fact that we are a U.S. manufacturing facility located in New Jersey, as we talked about on the call, that we would want to -- that there is an incentive for them to approve domestic manufacturing capacity. And so we believe that they will want to do that with us, and we'll give them every reason to approve us. So we're going to move forward quickly, but we think that there's an incentive for them to do that."
7,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,7,Matthew Gregory Hewitt,"Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Understood. And then you actually just touched on another question I had, maybe just elaborate a little bit further. Given what's happened regarding the coronavirus, COVID-19, and what appears to be at least the initial stages of a desire to bring more manufacturing back into the country versus China, India, whatnot, how does that set you up? Let's assume we get through the headwinds over the next year, get through these inspections and what not, but how does that set you up going forward given your domestic capacity?"
8,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,8,Matthew Gregory Hewitt,"Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"I think it sets us up well. Obviously, we are right in the wheelhouse there, being a domestic manufacturer. I think it sets us up for the potential for success. And while we don't know exactly what -- it's awful hard to predict exactly what the FDA or what, quite frankly, the government will do, but we feel good about being a domestic manufacturer, and we feel good about the opportunities that, that's going to present for us in the future."
9,"Teligent, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2020",QA,9,Matthew Gregory Hewitt,"Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division",ANALYSTS,"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Sawyer, President and CEO, for any closing remarks."
