we appreciate you time and attention today
on today 's call I will start with a overview of we operation give the rapid spread of covid-19 and its impact on
New York City before review we result and accomplishment in the_first_quarter
I will then turn the call over to Drew to discuss we first quarter financial result in more detail
I would like to start by thank we employee for they extraordinary effort during this challenging time
they have work tirelessly to ensure that the bank 's operation be run smoothly and we support to we customer and community remain uninterrupted
the safety of we employee and customer be we top priority
I want to share with you all a brief story of how we find ourselves in the door of the COVID crisis
I have be attend a bank conference in Switzerland in February as the pandemic be begin to flare uncontrollably in Italy where I be also schedule to travel for meeting
needless to say I can not put my trip around and head back to New York as my proximity to the pandemic open my eye to the risk that it hold not only to the U.S. but New York City in particular
this be truly a case of be in the wrong place at the right time and I know that we crisis management team need to put we pandemic plan into place as I believe the shut-in of New York be imminent
we crisis team implement plan to move to almost 100 % of we employee to a work from home environment by the middle of March and we have quickly adapt to this new normal
we manager be check with they direct report daily to ensure that we operation continue to run smoothly and I be very pleased to report that we staff be seamlessly handle transaction and make new loan
I be very proud of they effort and we have not miss a beat
since we founding almost 100 year ago we have have a commitment to the greater good which have shape the business model and we value
we believe that a financial institution mission should include use its resource money and influence to help move its customer its community and society forward
while we find ourselves in a unprecedented environment we mission and value be unchanged and they continue to guide we senior leadership team and the decision that we make as we navigate these unchartered water
First and foremost we remain committed to we employee have reposition branch staff to other area of the bank 's operation that have see a increase in activity
we be commit to the physical emotional and financial health of we team and have no plan to lay off we employee during this uncertain time
we also remain committed to we community and those in need
I be amaze and thankful for the effort of those that be battle this crisis on the frontline and I be very pleased that we be able to create the Frontline Workers Fund which offer direct assistance to nurse and healthcare worker grocery worker clean service worker foodservice worker laundry worker in we hospital and retail worker to name just a few
we also launch the family and worker fund in partnership with a consortium of foundation whose goal be to provide financial resource to vulnerable work family across the country
this fund have initial commitment of $ 7.1 million and the goal be to raise $ 20 million in order to provide flexible funding to organization strive to prevent worker and family from sink deeper into level of poverty during the initial month of this pandemic
all of this would not be possible without the strategic transformation that Amalgamated have undergo in the last six year
when I be appoint CEO in we team undertake a broad plan design to unlock the profit potential of the bank which include recruit talented executive from across the banking industry grow we customer base instil a disciplined expense culture and improve the quality of both we asset and source of funding
this have lead to a stable low-cost deposit base
we have also close unprofitable business line and significantly reduce we brand footprint
most importantly we have re-instil a disciplined credit culture which have result in strong credit performance of we loan portfolio
as part of we comprehensive credit risk management process we make the decision to run off we indirect C&I portfolio and significantly de-risked we balance_sheet over the last two year which I be very grateful for give the current market backdrop
today the bank be on firm financial footing with a strong capital base and a well underwritten loan portfolio as can be see in we first quarter result and which provide confidence in we ability to weather the storm
for the_first_quarter we report first pre-tax pre-provision income of $ 25.5 million which compare to $ 16.5 million in the 2019 fourth quarter
we grow average deposit by $ 400 million or 36 % annualize as compare to the fourth quarter of 2019
we cost of deposit be basis_point down from basis_point in q4 and non-interest bearing deposit be 48 % of end deposit
we net interest margin expand three basis_point to 3.46 % from the 2019 fourth quarter
importantly we efficiency ratio improve to 59.97 % and we remain well capitalize with a common equity tier 1 ratio at 12.74 % as Drew will discuss in more detail
we record a provision expense of $ 8.6 million primarily drive by $ 3.4 million dollar in we indirect C&I portfolio and $ 3 million in qualitative factor both largely due to the impact of covid-19
we be watch we loan portfolio carefully and be proactively work with we borrower in more challenging industry on payment due for we to help they through this time period
while we expect provision to go higher we remain confident in we strong credit culture and believe we be well capitalize to handle a even more severe recession
it be important to emphasize that we core customer we union and non-profit be not primarily credit customer
these customer in they relationship with we be primarily on the deposit side of the bank
additionally though we be base and headquarter in
New York City we credit exposure be more broad base geographically
we have also be aggressively reduce expense to ensure we remain well position to handle a extended downturn while not sacrifice the underlie fabric of we business
we focus have be on reduce some deposit expense initiate a hire freeze beginning in April cut back on non-essential project shift resource internally most specifically at the branch level improve call center operation and cancel unnecessary service
we expect these step to help mitigate the impact of lower interest in equity market value on we revenue
we have a experienced team in place that be execute the necessary adjustment on not take out cost that will affect the operational capability or competitive position of we business on a go-forward basis
look forward we understand that the_future be uncertain and we be opportunistically manage we noninterest expense to maintain we financial flexibility and ensure the long-term success of the bank
one growth initiative that we have move forward with be the opening of we commercial banking office in Boston
I be very pleased to announce that we have hire -lsb- Mark Wash -rsb- to head the office and oversee a team
Mark have over 13 year of experience as a leader in the non-profit and political sector in the Boston area and bring a wealth of local knowledge to the bank give the pandemic and shelter-in-place order that continue to exist we expect the ramp of we Boston office to be more gradual that we be already start to see new client acquisition and we will delay the opening of we Los Angeles office until the environment begin to normalize
turn to we capital allocation priority we have suspend we share buyback give the uncertain economic environment and we will evaluate we dividend with we Board of director each quarter
that say we announce yesterday a second quarter dividend of $ 0.08 per share
additionally we be watch the economy closely and aggressively manage we business to adapt to this new environment
while m&a have be a growth driver for the bank we will remain on the sideline until we have more clarity on the recovery
give we positioning and capital we would look to take advantage of opportunity that present themselves as a recovery take hold and the economy begin to normalize
I be also very proud of we mission-aligned initiative and accomplishment that we have achieve thus far in
of note we launch we corporate Social Responsibility Report on April 13 which provide a comprehensive overview of we CSR policy strategy and initiative
we CSR report provide a wonderful overview of all the good that Amalgamated be do in the world and we continue to build on we reputation as America 's socially responsible bank every day
I be also please to see that we initiative and effort be be recognize as msci raise we ESG score from BBB to a and we improve we certified b Corporation score to from
to conclude I be very pleased with we first quarter result and the positioning of we loan portfolio as the country work together to the defeat the spread of covid-19
we remain well capitalize to successfully weather the storm and take advantage of opportunity that we people client and customer first and we will work with they through this period of uncertainty
I would like to thank all of we employee again who have work tirelessly over the last eight week to make we mission possible
and together we will see this through
I would now like to turn the call over to Drew for a more detailed review of we financial result
thank you Keith
I will begin by review we first quarter result before turn the line back to the operator to open for question
turn to slide
in the_fourth_quarter end deposit increase $ 435.6 million or 37.5 % annualize to $ 5.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2019 while average deposit for the_quarter be $ 4.8 billion
average non-interest bearing deposit increase $ 276.5 million from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonality related to the election cycle and now represent 48 % of average deposit at quarter end
we cost of deposit decrease to basis_point down three basis_point compare to basis_point at year 's end
as Keith mention we expect the cost of deposit to continue decrease as a result of re pricing in reaction to the Fed cut rate to near zero
deposit from politically active customer such as campaign PACs and state and national party committee increase $ 196.2 million from $ 578.6 million at December 31 , 2019 and in the_first_quarter at $ 774.8 million as outline on slide
the election environment continue to be a source of growth for we deposit franchise
the focus for this_year will be the presidential race
we have and continue to be a partner support the business need of the majority of democratic candidate
it be worth note that in April we continue to see a influx of deposit and balance have increase another $ 247 million since the end of the first quarter of which $ 47 million be from political deposit
as a result of the deposit growth the bank just cross the $ 6 billion mark in total asset
as see on Slide we deliver loan growth of $ 76.2 million or 8.9 % annualize as compare to December 31 , 2019 and end the_quarter with $ 3.5 billion of total loan
this loan growth be drive primarily by a increase in C&I loan of $ 58 million of which $ 24 million be the purchase of government guaranteed loan
a increase in residential loan of $ 50 million and consumer loan of $ 26 million
the growth be offset by a $ 53 million decrease in commercial real estate and multifamily loan due to payoff where we choose not to match the term of other lender to retain the loan
as a reminder we balance of pace assessment be now report in the held-to-maturity security portfolio which be inclusive of approximately $ 255 million in purchase pace assessment
we new investment in PACE Funding Group will allow the bank to continue add pace assessment in the_future
so the trend maybe slower than originally anticipate due to the ongoing pandemic
as part of the Cures Act the bank have implement a payment deferral program for consumer and commercial customer
the standard agreement allow for three month of deferral of principal and interest
these loan be not report as delinquent on we financial statement and be not downgrade solely due to the payment deferral program
in total we have set up approximately 9 % of we loan on a deferral program which be show on slide
we expect that number to grow over the come week particularly for commercial client who be still go through the process
on slide we have highlight we residential loan portfolio by origination source
all portfolio have strong loan-to-value coverage and it be worth note this be compare to the original appraisal on the property and not adjust for HPI increase over time
these request in the residential portfolio be heavy in the first part of April but have since slow down
move to slide we be show the portfolio in C&I and cre where we expect to see covid-19 impact
in the C&I portfolio we have $ 112 million or 3.2 % of total loan that be in industry that be deferral
multifamily and commercial real estate we have have many inquiry from property owner on payment deferral option
as of April 24 $ 155 million of balance have receive payment deferral
unlike the residential portfolio the request from commercial client have be slower and we expect this number will continue to increase throughout the_second_quarter
we investment security portfolio have also see impact on the mark to market for the available for sale security during the_first_quarter
in the last few week of March the fixed income market for non agency security be particularly volatile and the fair value of the available for sale security portfolio decrease by $ 25 million compare to year-end which be a improvement from the low of mid March
since the end of q1 value have continue to improve but there may be more volatility in the_future
turn to slide
we net interest margin be 3.46 % for the_quarter a increase of basis_point from the_fourth_quarter and a year-over-year decrease of basis_point
the increase in NIM compare to a link quarter be primarily due to the lower cost of interest bearing liability as a cost of interest bearing deposit drop by basis_point and borrowing cost be essentially zero due to deposit growth
first quarter nim include basis_point of accretion of the loan mark from the new resource bank acquisition
basis_point from pre-payment penalty on loan as compare to and basis_point respectively in the fourth quarter of 2019
on a go-forward basis we expect NIM to decline in the_second_quarter as we start to see the impact of the most recent -lsb- Fed cut -rsb- to zero which will be partially offset by deposit cost reduction
in addition the inflow of deposit have be more heavily deploy in the float rate agency security be hold in cash in the_second_quarter and that will also pressure net interest margin
net interest income for the first quarter of 2020 be $ 44.7 million which compare to $ 42.3 million in the link quarter and a approximately $ 3.9 million increase as compare to $ 40.8 million in the same quarter of 2019
now on to non-interest income
non-interest income from the first quarter of 2020 be $ 9.1 million increase from $ 7.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 and a $ 1.7 million increase compare with the first quarter of 2019
the main factor for the growth in the_quarter be the sale of we Tremont branch for a gain of $ 1.4 million which have be exclude from core net income
as Keith mention the initiative to reduce non-interest expense on a go-forward basis
for the first quarter of 2020 we net interest expense decrease to $ 32.3 million dollar compare to $ 33.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter
this_quarter 's expense include $ 1.4 million of non-core expense primarily related to branch closure which will not recur next quarter
on a core basis we expense be $ 30.8 million which reflect we ongoing expense discipline
as Keith mention earlier we be focus on expense management as part of we pandemic response initiative and we expect to run expense below $ 32 million per quarter for the remainder of the_year
skip ahead to slide the credit quality of we portfolio be hold steady throughout the_first_quarter as nonperform asset total $ 65.6 million or 1.14 % of period end total asset at March 31 , 2020 compare to 1.25 % as of December 31 2019
a decrease of $ 1.1 million from the link quarter and a increase of $ 9.1 million as compare to March 31 2019
criticize and classify loan increase by approximately $ 16 million in the_first_quarter compare to the link quarter drive primarily by the downgrade of one construction loan on the West Coast of $ 7.9 million and a increase in C&I and retail
the provision for loan loss in the first quarter of 2020 total a expense of $ 8.6 million which be primarily drive by a increase in specific reserve of $ 3.4 million and two loan in the indirect c&i portfolio which be impact by covid-19 issue and the addition of $ 3 million to the qualitative reserve
the indirect c&i loan be previously tdr and be not eligible for the payment deferral treatment afford by the CARES Act
we do expect to have a elevated level of provision in the_second_quarter as we continue to update qualitative factor be base on information available in the_second_quarter
charge-off on currently delinquent consumer loan may also be elevated in the_second_quarter if those loan be not deem to be impact by covid-19 and be not eligible for deferral
skip to slide
we gaap and core return on tangible common equity be 7.6 % and 7.7 % for the first quarter of 2020 respectively
the core return compare to 10.7 % for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 10.2 % for the comparable period in
the decrease in core return on tangible common equity in the link quarter be primarily due to the previously discuss provision take related to covid-19
lastly we remain well-capitalized to support future growth
to conclude we be pleased with we first quarter 2020 result give all the event that have occur
give the fluid environment today and the uncertainty that exist we have decide to suspend we current full year outlook until the economy begin to recover and normalize from today 's event
thank you again for you time today
we look forward to update everyone on we second quarter result in July
with that I would like to ask the operator to open up the line for any question
operator
thank you
at this time we will conduct a question-and-answer session
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan
please proceed with you question
hey good morning everybody
hi good morning
hi Steve
I want to start on the provision and regard the commentary that you expect a increase in the q2 reserve tie to payment deferral
so you guy be not on cecl you be sell to the incur loss model and then at that regime what do you need to see the change further to drive a increase in the reserve
be it just new deferral come in
so Steve the keep in mind and this be specifically the qualitative reserve that I be talk about and we be about to talk about here just to be clear
so when at March 31 we do not have a lot of deferral we have actually no deferral activity that we be start to have inquiry come in at that point and start to get we process in the place
so when we set the qualitative factor at March 31 the only thing we really have to work off of whereas the downgrade of the economic factor which we take from pretty much the lowest level to the highest level
so we do kind of the maximum qualitative impact on economic factor and we use the same standard nine factor that I think many other bank use
the factor that we will be look at this time in q2 be the trend of normally be the trend of past due in the portfolio but the trend of deferral past due et_cetera in the portfolio which again I think will move from pretty low level to depend on the portfolio somewhere between medium and high
but if we go from the event
it be not a q1 event unfortunately
okay
Got you
other bank be say that they be see material drop off in new deferral though
I mean in term of the pace have you see any abatement in term of the pace of request
be those still increase
no as I be just say on the call residential have basically slow
actually the last few day we have have no deferral request at all come through or new deferral request
so that part of the portfolio have pretty much stop
now we be come up to a new set of payment so I do not know what that be go to mean
I do not think anyone know what that be go to mean for the next round
it might mean absolutely nothing it might mean that we see some incremental deferral come in but I think the majority of it have probably already happen
on the multifamily commercial real estate I think general commercial real estate and c&i have react pretty quickly
I think multifamily a lot of April payment be make
I think they be probably wait the landlord and be probably wait to see the May payment and we may see some more deferral come in through that
now it would not surprise we at all
see more deferral come in particularly in multifamily
the other thing I will add be the processing on the commercial side at least for we be slower because on the consumer side the residential side we ask the customer to describe they hardship but we do not require any proof because to do so would be difficult and unreliable
on the commercial side we actually ask the borrower to document for we they decrease in cash flow before we grant the deferral
so the process take a little longer to work through
okay that be helpful
and then on slide the COVID-19 expose sector I be curious what worry you most in term of what you be call out and maybe in the cre book how much of that be retail
well overall what worry I be probably more of a there be a lot to worry about Steve so let I just pick the one that probably worry I and I know Keith the most because we talk about it be we portfolio that be base on real estate whether its residential or multifamily commercial I think have very strong loan to value and implicit in that underwriting be that we will be able to control the property over time if need to work out the credit
and I think give how widespread the impact of this pandemic have be it be quite possible that the rule change in term of foreclosure how fast property or tenant turnover and that could mean that the normal time to work out a credit across the industry change
I be not say it will but that be I think what kind of worry I maybe more than I would know normally be worry about it if that make sense
yes
I totally agree with Drew on that
look what be in hotel and restaurant obviously every bank that have those on they portfolio be go to be concern about those individual name
it be not a huge percentage of the portfolio so while I do not love it it be not the big worry
I think Drew be exactly right
what we can not predict particularly with the New York city-centric multifamily portfolio and other thing be when the pressure will really come on landlord
what will the impact of stimulus payment and potentially new stimulus payment individual people start to receive enhance unemployment benefit be they able to continue to make they rent and mortgage payment
and what will be the other countervail political pressure that will be on the ability for anybody to be able to sort of deal with the property that they have and work it out in a normal way
it be a big big unknowing to we and well I think we build a this and the unknowing as you look at month out into the_future here be there to be extend double digit unemployment kind of pressure be just the biggest worry that we have on that bank
yes
okay thank you
and then just finally Drew with deposit growth run so strong it sound like the pace demand have slow a bit give the pandemic maybe long growth too
how do you see and what do you see for invest this camp
what kind of yield should we expect
thanks
yes
it have all happen very quickly and clearly we have not be able to thoughtfully and carefully deploy it out so in the near term we have purchase a lot of float rate agency security
we do have a very strong residential pipeline from q1 that we be work through
I think for q2 and I think pace assessment that come on the book on q2 as well will be pretty strong
so I think q2 I think we be okay but we be go to end up with a lot of cash and a lot of float rate agency on the book
now keep in mind we be also expect to have the political deposit start to run off maybe a little bit
I do not know if at the end of q2 we will see that but I think we be go to want to stay more liquid in the near term just to be in a great position to be able to offset that upcome run off and not necessarily have to go into borrowing although we may choose to do that and we will just continue to grow the balance_sheet
but we first and foremost think here and I think probably most bank be in the same boat be be extremely careful with deploy cash and capital into credit right_now and make sure we understand what we be get into as best as we can in the new environment that we be all deal with
okay great thanks for all the color
thanks Steve
good morning
hi Chris
good morning Chris
we next question come from Chris O'Connell with KBW
please proceed with you question
I be hope you guy could dive into a little bit the PPP program you have go_on and just how it be logistically work in term of provide you customer with the referral
yes
I be happy to Chris
we be not a sba certified lender and as you know we be not a bank that be particularly gear up to do small business loan
it have never be one of we focus
we do not really have the capacity to be able to handle the origination request and the loan servicing request to handle a small business portfolio
and over the past several year we have have a renewal relationship with one of the country 's largest non-bank sba lender that have work very well for we in normal time
and we make a decision early on probably not anticipate unlike a lot of bank quite what the demand would look like to do referral for mostly small nonprofit organization who be eligible for the PPP loan
they be not normally eligible for sba loan but be for the PPP program
we get about referral into that program
we refer they onto we partner to be able to handle those loan
we banker have help people through the process and continue to fill out they application but we partner have really handle the underwriting and the origination of those of those loan request
get it
and do you know what the dollar amount be on the amount that you prefer
I do
but Chris I be go to have to get you that more accurately because I do not have that at my fingertip
Drew do you know at the top of you head
how many have fund
what the total loan request volume be
we will get to the number Chris
in unit
it be over
I think in dollar amount it be probably yes I do not know the number actually
I do not want to speculate
the other place where we be go to participate in PPP which be really the only way that we have the ability to do so be from a new tech we will or we do plan to purchase some of they sale of the PPP loan which it actually the duration of those loan match very well with the political run off cycle that we be anticipate
so that be a risk free short-term use of cash that we should be able to do too be kind of we way of help the ppp program work
get it
get it
and then if we could shift to the balance_sheet in particular loan
I think you mention in the press_release that there be some -lsb- loan -rsb- purchase this_quarter if you could just go through maybe the amount and what type of loan those be
and then just overall you outlook on loan growth for the rest of the_year give just the big shift in the environment from last quarter to now
yes
so in term of loan purchase first of all we do purchase $ 35 million of residential loan on the West
Coast which normally we have not be do but we be do that for CRA purpose
so those be go to be high quality residential loan
it be more about the geography that they be in than anything else
we do do some more solar loan purchase
I think the amount there be probably about $ 35 million
there be one transaction we have be work on for a while that do finally close
I think for residential solar purchase at least for now that be probably it for we in term of what we will be do same for residential loan purchase
and then sba as well we every quarter we seem to be purchase some sba or maybe more I should say sba and USDA
they be government guaranteed loan that show up in we C&I portfolio
so we do do some more purchase for those as well
we total government guarantee loan sit in C&I be now about $ 150 million
so it be a place we have like to deploy capital risk free
get it
Chris just to follow up on you past question
I email really quickly we Head of Commercial Banking
the total loan request be approximately $ 65 million under the PPP program
Great
and then just finish up on the loan side maybe dive into the outlook for the rest of the_year just give some of the change in the economy
yes outlook 's cloudy
I will be honest
I mean what we be see be I think there be more opportunity now in high-quality loan than there be before this begin
I think the multifamily space have loosen up a little bit
but obviously we be be very cautious there only do the highest quality deal
we be require six month of P&I reserve for anything that we be currently underwriting
but those deal be now move forward
Residential we have so much come through in q1 before all this happen as a result of just rate continue to go lower that we actually sort of effectively turn off we pipeline
I think we be now look at turn it on again in a very conservative manner
so I think that we should still see some growth there but it be probably slower than we anticipate
and pace will continue to come on as well in the security portfolio
I be actually pleasantly surprise with how PACE origination be go with we partner
it be certainly down but it be not out
so I think those will be some of we growth area
and then we continue to have a pipeline of C&I loan as well that we be look at
but we have obviously turn the dial several match in term of the risk that we be willing to put on the balance_sheet at this point
but we be also still in business to originate
get it
and then on the deposit side I mean obviously political deposit be really strong this_quarter and much stronger than I think even you guy be expect
do you have any outlook on kind of I mean it be be strong come into the_second_quarter as well it seem like
I mean be there any outlook I guess that you can provide
or be it still kind of murky give the election cycle
look one thing I would emphasize be we have see as we have in the past couple of quarter nice deposit growth across we sector not just in the political sector in we commercial banker
even though they be in a work home environment they remain active in term of talk to a number of we exist customer and look for new relationship
so that activity have not stop or slow at all
the election cycle obviously be also in a bit of a murky environment
it be get a little bit more clarity on the that piece of the race will start to see a consolidation of contribution there that will help in that
and we should continue to see some growth there
vulnerable democratic candidate who be in they first term have a very very good first quarter of fundraising
anticipate they have a good second quarter as well
but we should as in past year start to see a plateau start to happen where people as we have talk about before sort of raise and spend that a equal clip
and I think as campaign make adjustment to figure out how to spend money in this environment we should start to enter into a plateau phase and then again see the run-off of the deposit portfolio towards the end of the third quarter beginning of the fourth quarter as we have see in past election cycle
that be the best crystal ball I have at this point
I could be wrong by a little bit but I think that would be the general pattern that we will see Chris
Great
thank you
and then just one last one on the NIM
I appreciate the guidance
probably down next quarter and I know there be a lot of move part here particularly with the political deposit and kind of unknown how that might end up for the_quarter
but assume maybe they stay flat here for the remainder of 2q at the balance payout that you guy give in the deck just give all the movement in short-term rate can you give any look into just maybe a range or how that might factor into the_quarter over-quarter and nim for 2q
it be go to be it be tough to see where it be this early in the quarter give all the movement that have happen
I mean I think you be probably go to be look at just and it be a combination of a little bit of NII start to flatten or maybe drop a little bit and then the balance sheet growth just expand very rapidly because keep in mind the average that you be look at for the q1 nim be probably just give all the end of quarter activity be probably $ 200 million light compare to where they would be if you just take the April or the kind of end of March average if that make sense
but it be go to be on lower yield asset because of where we have deploy it
I think maybe in term of NII which I be a little more comfortable talk about at this point just give all the volatility when we model we obviously have we disclosure last quarter where it be I think about $ 13 million down for basis point drop which just happen
I think we be look at more like $ 7 million down when we factor everything in which be a pretty decent size improvement and that be a combination of I think a little better performance in term of prepayment speed LIBOR
that assume LIBOR come down a little bit from where it be which it be already do
and I think we deposit re pricing have be more effective than we think it would be in the model
and part of that be just how fast it happen and money market yield which be sometimes competition for we effectively go to zero

Mr. Clemmer
thank you Melissa and good morning everyone and thank you for join we for angiodynamic fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings call
join I on today 's call be Steve Trowbridge AngioDynamics Executive Vice President and Chief_Financial_Officer who will provide a detailed analysis of we third quarter financial performance
give the impact that the covid-19_pandemic be have on we company and we customer during this call Steve and I will take a tailor approach to assess we third quarter result and discuss we perspective on the business move forward
with respect to the_third_quarter we will discuss we forward we will discuss we perspective look through the lens of the fact as they exist today while acknowledge that the fact circumstance and situation for everyone remain highly fluid and dynamic and be likely to change significantly in the short and medium term
with that say I would now like to provide a overview of we operating and execution highlight for the_quarter as well as some commentary on the impact of the covid-19_pandemic on we company
we have a strong third quarter
we report solid top line performance during the_quarter
we revenue increase 6.5 % year-over-year and increase 9.3 % when exclude Asclera and it be drive by growth in all of we business
in addition we be pleased to report that we deliver adjust ep of $ 0.01 per share
we believe this clearly demonstrate we ability to simultaneously invest in those business that will fuel we transformation into a growth company while be thoughtful and disciplined about we overall spending
we believe these result provide continued evidence of we successful ongoing transformation into a more focused medical technology company deliver unique and innovative health care solution into larger and faster growth market
during the_quarter we remain focus on driver to continue this transformation internal research and development m&a and clinical and regulatory pathway expansion
let I update you on we accomplishment in each of these area
on the r&d front we continue to focus investment on we key technology AngioVac AURYON and NanoKnife while seek out way to increase the profitability profile of we other product
earlier this year we announce that we have launch NanoKnife and AngioVac
and we speak with you about expand we AngioVac platform through the continued commitment to focus internal research and development
I be happy to say that we remain on track to deliver new AngioVac product in the next 12 to 18 month and we look forward to share these development with you in the_future
in term of we recent m&a activity we continue to advance the AURYON technology and progress towards commercial launch through investment in primary area ensure a strong and robust supply_chain build position and sale training program and build a dedicated selling and marketing channel to take this product to the market in the proper way
additionally the integration of we recently acquire c3 wave picc tip location system be progress nicely and customer have already begin to express interest in this new product
M&A will continue over the medium and long term to play a important role in we transformation
however we be clearly in uncharted territory due to the covid-19 global pandemic
while we will maintain we disciplined approach of identify appropriate m&a target and will continue to assess opportunity we will also prioritize the strength of we balance_sheet amid this rapidly evolve macroeconomic climate
Steve will provide more detail and perspective on we liquidity position later in the call
give that backdrop I be comfortable say that we will be more conservative with respect to M&A opportunity in the current environment of heighten uncertainty
the_third_quarter the third driver of we transformation be clinical and regulatory expansion and data generation which be foundational pillar to we strategic transformation
I would like to update you on we most important effort underway PATHFINDER and DIRECT
while we continue to focus on these area the current environment obviously require flexibility
with CMS and hospital throughout the country seek to prioritize critical care procedure and seek to preserve treatment capacity additional site initiation activity and patient enrollment effort in both PATHFINDER and DIRECT have be pause
we be work internally to be in a position to ramp up these effort as quickly as possible once the situation allow we to do so
in mid-january we launch the PATHFINDER i-registry a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of we AURYON Atherectomy System
we believe this study will provide valuable scientifically back datum to further differentiate the AURYON System from competitive product in this space and build upon the excellent long-term result that patient experience during the IDE
the NanoKnife DIRECT IDE see solid progress through the_third_quarter
as of today study site have secure IRB approval
we remain very pleased with the pace at which leading institution have commit to we comprehensive clinical study and secure IRB approval
before I turn the call over to Steve I would like to provide a update on how the covid-19_pandemic be currently impact we business
we office-based employee be work remotely and do so efficiently and effectively
from a manufacturing standpoint we have employee on the manufacturing floor to ensure that we product be available to help save life
give the nature of this pandemic while we have effectively implement the business continuity and contingency plan that we have have in place we have also have to create some new one to help to protect we employee while they protect we supply_chain and ensure that production of we critical care product continue uninterrupted
in the interest of they safety at the request of we customer we have ground all of we field-based sale rep in order to help reduce transmission of the virus and free up hospital resource to focus on care for patient with covid-19
despite these challenge I be very proud of we team
they have do a terrific job in adjust and provide remote support to we global customer
we have be very proactive around CRM activity and business development planning so that we be prepare to spring into action once we customer be ready and have elective procedure resume
we have have great momentum head into this and we want to be sure we be ready to continue to build upon that momentum as we exit whenever that may be
from a procedural impact perspective we business include product that fall on both side of the critical care and necessary line
AngioVac case see strong growth during the_third_quarter and into the early day of the fourth quarter drive by AngioVac
but over the past few week we have see procedure slow as hospital have rightfully shift they focus to prepare for covid-19 patient
we have see some slowing of evlt procedure and even some lab close they door in the past couple of week
we anticipate that this business will be softer in the_fourth_quarter
Oncology procedure be straddle the line between acute and elective-like
we expect this trend to continue with some case proceed as plan and other see delay
we do believe that these be delay not cancellation as these be treatment that the majority of patient will proceed with
Laser atherectomy procedure with we AURYON laser have be continue in patch consistent with other procedure and be still in the very early ramp-up stage
and lastly sale of we va product include picc midline and port remain strong even over the past few week drive by we new agreement with Premier and a couple of new line extension for we picc
while the current environment be certainly unprecedented we be take the necessary step to prioritize the health and safety of we employee while also ensure that we be position ourselves for continue innovation in both as the environment return to normal over time
with that I would like to turn the call over to Steve Trowbridge we Executive Vice President and Chief_Financial_Officer
thanks Jim and good morning everyone
before I begin I would like to point you to the presentation on we Investor Relations website summarize the key item associate with we quarterly and year-to date result
I would like to reiterate something that Jim mention earlier which be that with respect to the_third_quarter we will discuss we result look through the lens of the fact as they exist at that time
with respect to we business move forward we will discuss we perspective look through the lens of the fact as they exist today
additionally unless otherwise note all prior year result and comparison exclude the contribution of we NAMIC fluid management business which we divest at the end of we fiscal year end May 31 , 2019
we net sale for the_third_quarter of_fiscal increase 6.5 % year-over-year to $ 69.8 million
exclude the fiscal revenue contribution from the Asclera sclerotherapy product which we stop distribute during the_fourth_quarter of_fiscal year 2019 revenue for the_third_quarter be 9.3 %
as Jim mention earlier all of we business post solid growth during the_quarter lead by strong performance by AngioVac and NanoKnife as well as we core picc and port product
we total vit business grow 4.3 % year-over-year and when exclude Asclera grow 10.5 % drive by higher sale of AngioVac which be up 44 % year-over-year and a second straight quarter of growth of we core product
AngioVac procedural volume remain strong with procedure increase 33 % year-over year represent we tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume and revenue growth
vascular access revenue increase 10.3 % during the_quarter drive by double-digit growth in sale of picc port and midline
we continue to integrate we recently acquire c3 wave tip location system and be already see positive impact of this product on we picc business together with the value picc distribution relationship we enter to in the_third_quarter
revenue from we oncology business increase 5.1 % primarily relate to growth from NanoKnife which be drive by both strong capital and disposable sale
total nanoknife sale grow 47 % year-over-year include growth in disposable sale of 21 %
total nanoknife capital sale be $ 1.4 million in the_quarter
this growth be somewhat offset by a continued anticipated decline in sale of we radiofrequency ablation product as well as softness in the performance of we BioSentry and balloon business
move down the income statement
we gross margin for the_third_quarter of_fiscal be 57.8 % a decrease of basis_point compare to a year ago drive primarily by product mix
as we discuss during we call last quarter this decrease be in line with we expectation
we research and development expense during the_third_quarter of_fiscal be $ 8.4 million or 12 % of sale compare to $ 6.9 million or 10.6 % of sale a year ago
we be continue to invest strategically in r&d and clinical with a focus on further develop we NanoKnife , AngioVac and AURYON product while focus on drive profitability of we other business
and prior to the current environment we continue to expect r&d spend to be between $ 32 million and $ 34 million in fiscal year_2020 include investment related to we acquisition of Eximo Medical now AURYON
in the current environment we be look to maintain investment in we key technology while be more measure in we investment in other area
SG&A expense for the_third_quarter of_fiscal increase to $ 31.1 million represent 44.6 % of sale compare to $ 27.1 million represent 41.4 % of sale a year ago
prior to the current environment we continue to anticipate SG&A spend between $ 126 million and $ 130 million for fiscal year_2020
we will support we upcome product launch as well as the need investment for a commercial release of AURYON head into fiscal ' 21
give the current environment we be continually assess controllable discretionary spend with a eye towards spend and cash management while maintain investment in we key technology
we adjusted net income for the_third_quarter of_fiscal be $ 0.4 million or $ 0.01 per share compare to adjusted net income of $ 1.9 million or $ 0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year
adjust ebitda in the_third_quarter of_fiscal be $ 3.8 million compare to $ 7.7 million in the_third_quarter of_fiscal
turn to we balance_sheet
in the_third_quarter of_fiscal we begin with roughly $ 41.2 million in cash and we use $ 17.8 million of cash in operate activity
during the_third_quarter we use $ 10 million of cash to fund the acquisition of the c3 Wave PICC tip location system
as of February 29 , 2020 we have $ 27.2 million in cash and cash equivalent and $ 15 million in debt outstanding
we enter this current environment with a strong foundational position have a net cash position and a revolver with meaningful available capacity
in addition inventory level be elevated in anticipation of complete we move out of the Glens Falls facility that we sell to Medline at the end of fiscal ' 19
in business continuity plan
we have be in contact with we strong and long-standing banking group and be keep a close eye on the environment
we be take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to we balance_sheet
we be focus on we collection
and while we will continue to keep a close eye on they we be pleased to say that commerce continue to be move
we be also pay close attention to we payable
we be not take a cynical approach and we have position ourselves to be a good customer while also be proactive
overall we believe we be in a solid position and we will remain focus on maintain dry powder and be proactive in the current environment
consistent with this approach we have initiate a modest draw of $ 25 million on we revolver
we believe that this be a prudent move illustrate both we focus on cash and liquidity and we strong foundational position
turn now to guidance
as Jim and I have discuss on this call we be please with we third quarter result
in addition we be encourage by we sale in the month of March both on they own merit and in light of the current environment
however we have see a slowdown and a shift in procedure during the last couple of week
give the reign uncertainty we do not believe it be possible to provide substantiate fourth quarter or full year guidance at this time
as a result and as note in we press_release issue this_morning we be officially withdraw we full year guidance
however I will discuss some directional color to help provide insight into what we be see in the market
as we have discuss throughout this call the covid-19 situation be incredibly dynamic which mandate and recommend change on a daily basis on both a national and state-by-state level with no firm insight no firm end in sight excuse I
the primary unknown at this point be twofold the first be the duration of the covid-19_pandemic and the impact it will have on elective procedure
the second be that we be unsure when we rep will be allow to get back on the road and gain access to we hospital and physician office
the potential range of outcome give these unknown be so broad and far-reaching that we be unable to provide a accurate guidance range at this time
as we mention earlier we have a strong third quarter and see that strength continue through the majority of the month of March
we be encourage by this but we see decline in procedural volume in late March and into the first week of April which we anticipate will continue throughout the_fourth_quarter
while this be incrementally more granularity on the current quarter than we would normally provide we feel it be important to share this give the context
as Jim mention earlier we establish exciting momentum through the end of q3 and we be work hard to ensure that we will be well position to sustain and build on that momentum once the situation allow
with that I would like to turn the call back to the operator to open the call for question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James
so just a few question
I be surprise with the strength in the vascular access business
can you just give we a little more detail on kind of the driver of the strength
and if you could maybe quantify the impact from the Premier agreement on the Port business
and also you mention some sort of value picc distribution agreement in the_quarter and I be a little unclear as to what that be
so a little detail on that would be helpful
a couple of thing
so in we VA business as we mention in the fall the Port win on the Premier business be important for we
but it be not the only piece of strength we see during the_quarter
because really this_quarter be more get those customer that be part of the Premier compliant agreement to get sign on with we and start the conversion process
so there be some growth there but not a whole lot
good news be the growth be balance
so we base picc business both we BioFlo and non-bioflo also experience a strong quarter
and a lot of that Jason too we have not talk a lot about it but we have a couple of really good partner in the mobile picc business
and these partner be commit to we BioFlo picc
and some of these partner have be gain market share over the past year or so build up they market as they provide that valuable service to many hospital look to outsource that technique and that procedure to these mobile picc team
so again they choose BioFlo in most of those case
and finally we do add some new product
we have talk a little bit about it just around we picc portfolio
as you know with BioFlo we have a high-end picc with unique capability but we have some gap in we picc line
so we just fill in a couple of the gap with some other product
Jason we expect the va business to grow with the area that we guide last_year
as you know be the first year of growth in many
and I think we anticipate growth about that same level this_year
and go forward it will be a business that be very well run and the portfolio be a bit more balanced
and now we make the acquisition of the c3 wave tip location system
again take out one more barrier that we have have there
Jason we do see strength throughout the VA portfolio throughout the_third_quarter
it be pretty balanced as Jim mention with we picc port midline and dialysis business all grow
so we hit a little bit on the value picc that Jim talk about fill in the gap in those line
we have mention c3 in the prepared remark
as we talk about before we do not really expect to see a big inflection potential from c3 until we get to the point where we be add navigation to that technology
so we have see strength in the base piccs business move in throughout this third quarter and we see that strength continue as we head into the_fourth_quarter
so one of the thing that Jim talk about in he remark be that line that we be draw between product that fall on the elective-like or those that can be delay and those that be clearly acute and critical care
we have be see the va business in those picc midline clearly fall on that line of critical care and we expect to see that strength continue throughout we fourth quarter
okay
so I guess just to summarize that point Steve the growth that you see this_quarter seem pretty durable at least for the next few quarter
we believe so yes
okay
and then I will just ask one more and then I will get back in queue
can you just update we on the status of the AURYON launch here
I be just a little unclear as to the rep build-out
be that complete
give the dynamic with covid when do you expect a full commercial launch
so Jason good point
it be be 6 month now that we have own the Eximo business and the AURYON product
so as we talk to you before the first part of the move be a supply chain build-out
so now we be manufacture the laser hardware to we spec and we supply_chain
we be also manufacture now the disposable catheter to we spec and we supply_chain
so we supply chain team have do a great job with we quality partner the last 6 month build this out
number two we need to build a sale training program and a physician training program
we have do those as well
so ready prepared to communicate those to the field
and finally number three be the dedicated commercial team as we communicate we would build
so today we have people dedicate to this auryon business
and over of those people be dedicated field sale reps. each of those have be hire
they have experience in they past life work for probably one of the other company in this space
so these folk be already experience atherectomy salespeople
they have relationship in they field in the area that we have hire they in and we expect good performance from they
as we get closer to full launch though Jason then we will give you a little more time line as to when we will add more people
so we be not at a full launch yet
we be right on track where we would be with this process
so we be excite on what we have learn
as soon as we get through a little bit of this covid-19 situation we can take a deep breath and we will share with you little more detail around the next phase of the launch
but it include have podium presence speaker to talk about the product how it work and how it be be receive in the market
be COVID the gate factor here
meaning once COVID be I do not want to say over but once this everything relax will you be able to launch the product
we will
Jason I do not think COVID have not change we plan
I think we tell you guy when we buy it we need about a 6-month window before we start to launch
in the last couple of week we have slow down spending here in a responsible fashion and slow down some of the investment we be make just to make sure we be discipline with we cash management and we balance_sheet
but COVID be not go to be part of the AURYON story
really we be build a story around those area
I can not wait till we can share more with you
it be really go at the pace we expect and we be excite to keep build the team there
Jason we continue to invest in AURYON
and so as we talk about we cash management priority we want to make sure that we be ready to hit the ground run when market dynamics allow we to do that
so we have continue to as Jim mention build up we supply_chain bring in the salespeople be ready to go
we do see the atherectomy procedure as some that be on that line tend to be delay during the current environment while health care system be look to build up capacity
so once that do ease a bit give the investment we be make we will be ready to hit the ground running as Jim say accord to we original plan
we next question come from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity
first maybe a 20,000-foot view question
the thing that strike we be quite surprising as we like everybody else be try to read as much as we can about what be go_on in the current environment in health care and procedural volume specifically be the extent to which procedure you would not assume would abate vis-à-vis a crisis like COVID physician be not see it
so stemi you be even see fewer stroke acute ischemic stroke come in to the hospital
and you mention pulmonary embolism
you say you have hear from physician that suggest that they be see fewer case
those tend to be acute case those tend to be case you can not delay they be life-saving case
have you see this as well
and what factor do you attribute to this
I think physician be scratch they head
and I just love you commentary on that as well as perhaps could you speak regionally
let we know be there any part of the country or the world where you be not see this phenomenon play_out where you be see sort of a normalize trend if you will of these case that you guy participate in that be acute like pulmonary embolism come into the hospital
and then I have a follow-up
Jason this be Jim
so Jason , good question
I have a conversation 3 day ago I think it be with a Chief of Surgery at one of the large Boston hospital who have mention for the_past or so week they spend so much time gear up to be ready to care for the covid-19 patient that they have ask some of the other doctor to stand down not just because they need to free up icu space but they want to free up PPE equipment to that level for the caregiver that be care for people in the critical care environment
so we have talk to many of we physician partner
and as we mention to you you see in q3 really dynamic growth with the AngioVac product and really well receive
but even here now we have see some case slow down a bit
I think physician be be tell to stay home stand down in many case
now we say that to you know the severe acuity that many of the patient that we product treat have
the cancer and ask they to go home and we will call you back with the treatment plan soon
in the_past they would have have a initial treatment plan we may have be part of those treatment plan
so Jason I think we like you be look for be look for that clarity from we customer
we be speak to a lot of we customer
because we be try to gain that clarity and be ready to support they
because we be also expect they expectation of we support may be different come out of this
we want to make sure we can align what they expectation be with we resource
you also ask about kind of geographic or regionally Jason
in the U.S. we have see the pocket that I think we have all see as a collective body around the hotspot
some be more severe than other
but really I guess even when I talk about U.S. only kind of all of we doctor and physician partner be tell we the same thing
they have be ask to step aside a little bit and to hold off treatment when they can not all case you can as we know depend on the patient acuity
but I think we be go to see at some point I think some hospital that we be speak with be also plan now to get back into a treatment protocol and to catch up for some of these treatment that have be delay
so I would expect at one point we be go to see not just a normalize treatment plan again but even a little catch up period I believe from we conversation with customer to make sure they can treat the people who have have to stand down for a little bit longer
and Jason outside of the U.S. as you know 80 % of we revenue be u.s.-based but we global partner be tell we similar story
we have even see a couple maybe situation where in Europe a couple of treatment have come back maybe a little sooner in the last week or so people be treat with we oncology product
Jason this be Steve
you have mention pulmonary embolism
we current AngioVac product be not really a pulmonary embolism product
for the most part we current AngioVac be use with tumble right atrial mass and tricuspid valve vegetation
what we the product the market that we play in I think be good example of what we be see in this dynamic environment
early on in this process early in March we AngioVac sale volume and the procedure volume that we be support with we clinical specialist remain quite strong
and so we be initially look at those right heart and tricuspid valve vegetation case as be on that necessary acute side of the line that we talk about
a trend that we clearly have see over the last couple of week be that line have move or the physician have define where that line be and that continue to change
and we have see a drop-off in those procedure
Oncology procedure be another example of one that we be see change throughout this time base mostly on what Jim talk about which be physician look to build up they capacity
but when you think about the oncology case and when you think about those case that the current AngioVac product play in we do see those as delay and not lose procedure that be come back
now as we mention in the_past and Jim talk about the AngioVac product extension that we expect to see in the next 12 to 18 month those be the product that we expect to be able to allow we entrance into the pulmonary embolism space and to get into that middle section of the thrombus management space where we think that there be a lot of case to be do
that be helpful both of you
and I want to get into a little bit more detail if you be willing on the new AngioVac product or at least targeting
and you sort of answer that to some extent but with pulmonary embolism
maybe talk about the target for those product
be they product that target separate anatomy i.e. pulmonary embolism for one deep vein thrombosis generally speak on the venous side on the other
or what detail can you give
and I guess lastly and I will get back in queue just back to the sort of macro discussion here because I be interested in the macro before we tackle the micro
I mean society have to tackle the macro
and the other need -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- as we can get on the frontline for COVID you be see hospital furlough health care worker tech et_cetera that would otherwise be participate in these elective procedure that as you mention be not happen as ubiquitously nearly as they be before
be that when we be on the other side of this will those hospital be able to rehire quickly enough so that there be not a lag and a delay in get back to some sort of a normalize environment
that phenomenon be interesting to I and I would be interested in you take on that as well as any detail you might be able to be willing to give on the new AngioVac product
yes
so thing
so again I do not want to speak for the caregiver and the hospital
I will not speak for how they be do it
but I can share with you the conversation we be have and the tone that we be get
because it be be pretty consistent Jason some of which be right exactly what you be ask for
so we have see some furlough as well some hospital
and I think if you see the root cause of that it be because some of the census be very low
some of the hospital be tell we that the patient census be down because they try to move people out of the hospital get they back home and they try to free up or create more icu or critical care space prepare for a influx of covid-19 patient
so I think that the care they be deliver on a routine basis be much lower than it be a month ago
they need less people
we hope again by talk to we hospital customer and partner that when this thing settle they can rehire the people back to get back to normal care standard that they would operate in
we also believe too even some of the conversation I think they be do some of that contingency planning now
if you speak to some of those hospital they tell we they be do some of that contingency planning of how they can get back in a rapid fashion
some people have tell we they may go to a 7-day operating schedule in they operating room to go back and treat people who have have to stand down for a little bit
so on a macro scale Jason I think we be all learn together of how we be go to treat this situation
but we be hear thing enough and we be close enough to the market that give we that hope that when people be ready to start treat people again in a normal situation we want to be they partner and we will be ready to partner as you have see with the momentum we have already generate this_year
now back to you initial question on AngioVac
we be not ready to discuss all the detail but we have talk openly in the_past publicly the next product we will launch
so angiovac that be launch in the fall be extremely successful in how it be launch
we redesign the funnel tip and do a few other thing that we physician partner ask we to do
the next version that come out which we be not good at name
AngioVac and we will probably have a better name for you by the time we launch it but it be a smaller version
we physician that say hey if you give we the same great feature and it be still on pump on circuit so can reperfuse the patient 's blood which make the procedure much less complicate from a patient recovery aspect
we be go to have the AngioVac will be different size to allow they to treat more people
and maybe open up a clinical pathway for we to get indication back to the area that you and I speak a few minute ago and Steve do with pe and other place
now the other product which be really special and unique we have talk about we want to also use some of the unique feature of AngioVac but take it off the pump and circuit that it be on today
so we want to be able to get to that larger space of people with maybe less acute situation of thrombus and we want to be able to treat a lot of those patient where we have see mechanical thrombectomy option in the marketplace be choose and select by physician as a better care of treatment
and some of that I think be due to some of the good option that other company have come out with
we think when we take AngioVac off circuit with its other unique feature will be a really really competitive option in that space
we think a lot of physician would like to try we product in that space
and we will get back to you soon with launch date there
but that be what we say Jason 12 to 18 month we expect both of those product to launch
we next question come from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc Capital Markets
Jim I just want to switch over to oncology first
I think you have a expectation come into the_year where you think you could do about 20_% growth in that area
definitely look like it be fall short over the first 3 quarter and really outside of just some very big number in NanoKnife it look like the other area be come in negative
can you go through the put and take of the balloon BioSentry and microwave as well
yes
Matt good question
a couple of thing
what we have learn during the course of this_year Matt we do set high expectation base upon we technology in these area
what we have learn let I get back to balloon and BioSentry right_now
I think we sale rep they probably put too much in they bag and I own that one
I think while we be there in some of the call point we be in we can have similar discussion base upon how these new technology be unique and work well
but in all case Matt the synergy be not there as much as we want to focus on speak about what NanoKnife do with we new registry-based approach and the IDE
so what we be do Matt differently now and we have learn these lesson we be go to we be invest in and create a new inside sale group that be go to handle the majority of we balloon and BioSentry business to take they out of the field sale bag
we know right_now how effective these product be when use for patient care and treatment
but we have get to do a better job of commercialize that conversation
so we have miss the boat a little bit there
so miss it
you be right
what be we do about it
we be change how we go to market
that be number one for balloon and BioSentry
number two for microwave we know and we believe deeply we microwave be better than the offering from Medtronic and J&J
what I think we have learn Matt it be not that much better to offset some of the market size clout and resource that those giant company have
so we microwave be better
I think if you match they up physician will say it be a great product
but same thing Matt I do not know if we can go toe-to-toe with these guy as the way we think we could because we be very encouraged about a year ago with some really good conversion some big medical center come over and buy we microwave versus some of the competitor
and that be still occur but not at the rate we think we could do it with
so we be take a step back Matt
and over the course of the summer -lsb- we launch you -rsb- whenever we can talk to you about we plan
we will show you how we be realign ourselves
what we believe Matt be over time microwave growth will probably be closer to market growth whereas the 20_% we point to this_year we think we could really exceed market base on how good we technology be and some initial conversation
I do not know if we can do that Matt sustainably
that be why we be go to bring down we own expectation for that product
it will grow nicely with market
it be a great product but we be go to shift more of we resource to make sure we support NanoKnife growth support those customer that be choose to enter we registry treat people and then collect the datum to do so
and then the final cusp there on NanoKnife we have already see how the version have be so successfully receive
you have see after 3 quarter we sell record amount of capital in either new nanoknife or upgrade to the new NanoKnife platform
that be encourage to we
people really love this new platform
but Matt we have get to go one step further
NanoKnife be really effective but it be also complicate to use and be tricky
so training and development of those physician practice be important
we also need to make the next step in technology to make NanoKnife easier to use and we have that design
it be call h-fire or high-frequency ire
so we be go to put more of the time and development to develop the next platform which we call h-fire and get this new platform to market as soon as we can that we think will then maybe match up really nicely with the culmination of we DIRECT study in a couple of year
and we see more and more people who want to use NanoKnife to treat maybe other organ over time
we want to have a platform that be ready to help support that and be easier to use
so Matt I give you a lot out there but some of that be show you where we miss why we miss and what we be do about it go forward rather than step back
yes go ahead
yes
like you say I think that be all fair and very helpful
on NanoKnife could you give we a sense of how do the number be very strong as far as the placement go and in the number of probe and the recur revenue
could you just give we a sense of how you be do with that in the U.S. versus you be like internationally
so it be a good question
I will look to Steve maybe Steve have more of a split on the geographic Matt
I think right_now we have see a balanced sale with we capital this_year both U.S. and OUS
it be be encourage though Matt some of the system that have be buy in the U.S. recently be full system
these be expensive product
I think people now be get interested in we DIRECT study and the ability for they to be part of the study and to set up a treatment protocol in they facility
so again as we tell you early this year we know that the q3 we just report this_morning have very strong disposable sale as you see on NanoKnife probe which be we expectation as we talk to you after q2
by sell record hardware in the first half of the year we know disposable would carry on
I be not I do not want to predict how we will be now in this_quarter in front of we but it be what we expect
yes
and I think Matt we be see strength both in the United_States and outside the United_States
you can think of we current breakdown at about 60 % in the U.S. about 40 % outside the U.S. we have see some particular strength in the Asia Pac area outside the U.S. I think we have modify a little bit mitigate a little bit by EMEA
but we think that that be a temporary trend and we expect to see EMEA catch up and also be a big contributor go forward
so we have see strength throughout the globe drive by the U.S. but definitely some strength ous as well
okay
and then on NanoKnife and AngioVac both do you need a clinically train salesperson in the procedure room to make those effective
or be the doctor that be perform they capable of do that without a Angio representative in there
so that be interesting Matt
before the world change recently I think the answer from both we physician as well as we in term of what we be see at the time to that question would have be yes you need clinical specialist in those case
as the world have change we have notice that both we customer as well as we own clinical specialist have be very creative in provide that case support in this dynamic environment
so I think the answer be at a very high level yes
I do think that these NanoKnife procedure as well as AngioVac be complicated procedure that there be a tremendous value provide by we clinical specialist and the knowledge that they have
I think what we be see through this new environment be the manner in which we support those case can be somewhat dynamic
and I think that there be a opportunity to be creative in how we do that support go forward
but ultimately in the type of procedure that they have with the different disease state and the complexity of we product there be a role that be necessary for some level of support
okay
and then just last question on the cash_flow
you be able to do breakeven on net income but free cash_flow be negative $ 20 million
so a little bit more color on really what drive that
and from here I mean if you have the level of inventory in place that you think how capable be you guy of manage swing while also preserve you current balance sheet position
yes
it be a great question Matt
and it be absolutely something that we have be focus on over the last 4 week
so I think you kind of hit the point that we be look at pretty critically over the last several week and look at the cash_flow versus the net income
there be a couple of point that feed into that change in cash that I think be temporary
and I think you would -lsb- chalk up as -rsb- temporary
so we talk about the inventory build that be actually a big part of it right
$ 4 million to $ 5 million of that cash usage be in inventory build
now as we talk about go into the current environment we be plan to increase we inventory in anticipation of move all of we line out of the Glens Falls facility that we sell to Medline into Queensbury
so we have a big build as we be come in
we have continue to build in the first several week of this process
the next aspect of that then be go to be okay now that you have get the inventory as a backstop to what could be some potential disruption depend upon what happen at least in term of we production process you want to then burn off that inventory and so we be focus on that
there be some short-term additional funding that be acquire during the_third_quarter relate to AURYON into the israeli r&d aspect there
I think that will pull back a little bit
there be also a lot of timing
$ 7 million to $ 8 million of that cash usage I would say be in timing related to the tsa and some of the disaggregation activity come out of the Medline divestiture
so that will not repeat
so we talk earlier about focus on we cash understand where we want to continue to invest so we do not lose momentum in area like AngioVac AURYON and NanoKnife but then be much more control in term of that discretionary spend the third-party r&d spend in all the other product
the other thing we be keep a close eye on you have get a whole bunch of expense that end up not be spend just by the very nature of the situation that we be in
the fact that nobody can be travel t&e go way down
so we be keep a close eye on that
we feel really good that we be go to be able to maintain we strong foundational cash position through this downturn
we talk a little bit about initiate that draw
as both a opportunity to keep we eye on the cash_flow and make sure that we have get the right cash balance that we need but then also illustrate we strength
we be not look to draw the entire revolver
it be not a prudent thing to do at this time
it be not something that we need to do at this time
so we feel pretty comfortable that we will be able to maintain that cash position by reduce we expense that we have talk about not cut into those area that we want to make sure be go to maintain momentum when it be time to come out of that
and then also see some of those onetime timing thing that we see in q3 not repeat as we head into q4 and then into the first half of we fy ' 21
Ladies and gentleman this conclude we question-and-answer session
I will turn the floor back to Mr. Clemmer for any closing remark

thank you
thanks for join we today
we begin by acknowledge the pain that be inflict upon we fellow citizen in country especially we friend in place like New York who have be hit especially hard
we support and appreciate the effort be make all across the country especially the work of we medical professional and first-line defender and we stand together to defeat and overcome the terrible pandemic
it truly it be a terrible time
it be also wonderful to see so many aspect of american exceptionalism come together
Government policy the treasury department the sba the USDA the state banking department the Federal Reserve everyone work closely with citizen in the private sector
we be grateful for everyone 's effort
I would like to take a moment to congratulate and thank the bank7 team member for they tireless work
we truly have a exceptional company
we plan to work remotely be put in place very quickly and have function very well
we operation and it group have we work seamlessly
we be very proud of they effort
I also want to thank Jason Estes we Chief Credit Officer and the entire centralized credit function
they quickly and professionally enable we to handle loan modification in the new PPP loan in a very efficient manner
last but not least we lender and they support staff in every location have do a excellent job and I personally have receive many call and e-mail from customer thank we and frankly noncustomer who bank at large bank but who have ask we for help the strength of community banking be reveal itself yet again
we be certainly aware that in a matter of week we country change from a vibrant and booming economy to one with severe economic stress
after all be say and do we expect to have experience the most sudden and severe recession in the modern history of we country
there be no consensus on how far we will fall and no one have ever predict or encounter the speed at which GDP and unemployment have be negatively impact
we also know that this pandemic-induced stress have cause a immediate and severe liquidity crunch which be now morph into a credit crisis
what be very important to remember be this stress begin as a liquidity event not underlie credit issue unlike when the banking system be burden with excessive leverage especially when you include off-balance sheet item
the industry enter into this period with extreme strength
clearly challenge be everywhere
we industry will face increase credit risk margin pressure stress to we customer and team member and additional threat relate to it intrusion and cybercrime
regardless we remain very focus on we credit book liquidity capital level expense discipline and internal operation
we have closely analyze we extreme stress scenario and be use those in conjunction with we deep transactional knowledge
that be what guide we
we be comfort most by the thorough involvement between experienced credit executive who work with lender and they customer
we stress scenario be very severe
and if it materialize we remain confident of we revenue stream and the shock absorption capability of earnings and capital
this be why we expect to continue to pay we dividend
however we will watch very closely as we move through the next week and few month
we will continue to provide timely quality information but we also know event be unfold and happen at a rapid pace so it will take continuous effort
now let 's move into we datum
we focus will be on pretax pre-provision earnings and how that combine with we already strong capital cushion to provide strength to we already strong balance_sheet
reflect back to the January earnings call we be very excite about 2020 which be largely due to we strong loan pipeline some of which have already be book
we project loan growth for the_first_quarter do in fact occur
therefore we result reflect what we have anticipate a very solid quarter
we pretax pre provision income be very high and consistent with we history
in we slide deck we have highlight one of the great strength one of we great strength we wide profit margin
it rapidly add to we already robust capital level
therefore even with the uncertain future we be comfort that we will continue to add to we equity cushion
we be very proud of we strength in this area
in the current financial market of environment of shoot first ask question later let 's start with a refresher on bank7 and how we be build on try and true fundamental
we be a company that provide commercial banking service to company and they owner
in fact 98 % of we loan be commercial-purpose loan
we deliver the product and service use a branch-like model
bank7 and its banker be very close to customer
we be relationship banker not transactional banker
we have virtually no participation or share National Credits
we have decade of successful improve credit discipline that have enable we to avoid meaningful loss
we typically stay away from prevalent throughout we loan book and that be one of the contribute factor to we historically low net charge-off
essentially it be more of a needs-based loan book not a flashy one
you can easily glean that when you review we home construction loan metric and we hospitality loan book
we consistently maintain a strong nim
and those factor combine with we superb efficiency ratio and revenue per employee metric to produce those wide margin and consistently strong profit which provide we healthy shock absorption cushion
the result be high level of capital with 98 % of we capital be tangible capital good old-fashioned common stock and retain earnings
I would also add that we remain debt-free
in addition we also maintain very strong on balance sheet liquidity
so now let 's take a minute and review just a few of those fundamental component and we will start with capital
we enter into this pandemic-induced period of uncertainty with very high level of capital
include in we slide deck be very important illustration one that illustrate a significant cushion of capital and the other be a comparison of we pretax pre-provision run rate as compare to of the smaller exchange-traded bank
you can see we margin be far better
again not only do we enter the current crisis with heavy capital level we strong margin rapidly add to we capital base much faster than most other bank
we be very mindful that the near-term future be full of uncertainty
nonetheless we remain confident in we capital strength
the combined effort from government the Fed private industry customer and teammate will enable we to successfully work through the upcoming month and prevent we from experience a negative impact to we capital base
we confidence be further evidence by the fact that none of the share own by we insider have be sell not one share
we have far more at stake in this company than anyone else
now if we move into another primary component we net interest margin
we constantly maintain a excellent nim
as highlight in we January call the fourth quarter nim be very strong and we have expect that strength to carry into
however none of we anticipate the sharp and sudden decline in interest rate
look forward into the rest of the_year the industry and bank7 will experience downward pressure on NIM with most of the pressure appear in the latter part of the_year
nonetheless we still expect to maintain we nim within historical range
and remember we achieve that by be discipline with we floor
in fact base on the most recent Fed rate cut 92 % of we loan be either fix or already at they floor
we customer relationship be strong and deep and we customer know we be reliable partner
and when absolute borrowing rate be this low there be less pressure from they to lower rate
we also do not allow lender to negotiate lower rate or floor without executive management involvement and oversight
each customer request a rate or floor reduction be log into a spreadsheet maintain by the finance department and each request be evaluate by the lender and executive management
for the_first_quarter we have $ 55 million of loan which be 7 % in the portfolio that be reprice downward at a average repricing downward of basis_point
and remember during this time the Fed drop rate by basis_point
so now let 's spend a minute on liquidity
bank7 have historically maintain very good liquidity typically hold between $ 75 million and $ 125 million of cash at the Fed which be a very substantial amount of money for a company we size and we continue to operate in that manner
this pandemic-induced stress clearly begin as a liquidity event which quickly morph into a systemic credit crisis
have say that this clearly be not you father or grandfather 's liquidity crisis
the U.S. government and Fed intervention be unprecedented far-reaching spread across the board and those action combine with a fully entrenched digital electronic currency system have clearly calm the market
for the consumer segment the ability to instantly and seamlessly provide fund to pay for goods and service have significantly reduce consumer panic which be a good thing as consumer sentiment be fragile but will be critical to help the economy recover
after all 70 % of GDP be consumer spending
lawmaker the treasury department the state banking department and the Fed have demonstrate they commitment to provide multiple backstop to the entire monetary system and that have add stability to the market
in fact when you look at the Fed be most recent h8 datum it be quite revealing
on a year over-year basis commercial loan be up in the 25 % range pretty much unprecedented
you may ask how the loan growth comment relate to liquidity and that be due to many company draw on credit facility and simply redeposit the money into the banking system
that same h8 datum show annualize deposit growth on a year-over-year basis that be also in the double digit the strongest anyone can remember
the Fed action and U.S. government program be temporarily prop up the economy
and ironically the liquidity crisis be quickly abate as evidence by so much money that be end up in the U.S. banking system
on top of all of that the global flight to safety have cause international liquidity to flow into the U.S. and we banking system with liquidity be sufficient the long hard work of economic recovery will soon begin
I would argue it be already begin
another tool to support liquidity be the new Fed funding facility for we PPP loan which we be utilize and take full advantage of and that allow we to preserve we liquidity for normal banking need
last but not least be credit quality
we be mostly in uncharted water
however there be a few moment in history that can help we understand what a recovery might look like
we can refer to the devastating flood in Houston event such as Hurricane Katrina
in those case the insurance industry provide a major backstop compare to today when the government program and tax policy which will be the primary driver to help with recovery
we realize this pandemic be far-reaching in different
nonetheless we remain confident that we asset quality will remain relatively strong as we underwriting principle and long-time customer relationship have always carry we through the toughest of time
we confidence be also base on one primary underlie assumption which be that the pandemic induce stress be a near-term to medium-term event with America return to a more normalize environment sooner rather than later
clearly a longer period of continued stress will cause or would cause greater uncertainty and we complete economic recovery will largely depend on how long it take the country and its citizen to emerge from they home and get back to work and they life
even when that occur there will be a new normal which no one can yet predict but it be certain that consumer behavior will change which will benefit some industry but harm other
therefore we expect a uneven recovery
one key factor and strength of bank7 that must be remember be we strategy of loan into more of the blue collar type of project and segment essentially a more needs-based segment
you can especially see that by review the stratification datum within the hospitality and cre segment
experience have teach we that economic downturn typically hit the more leverage and higher-end segment especially hard
we also know that past recession have reveal the strengthen in what we call the cycle-down segment of the economy
we be very confident of we loan book
be mindful of the heighten scrutiny surround credit quality we have provide enhance report to we energy , hospitality and cre segment
we enhance reporting be provide with a view towards maintain customer privacy as well as be aware that competitor also review material
so with that be say let 's ask Jason Estes we Chief Credit Officer to walk we through the credit book
thank you Tom
with all due respect to the pandemic and the challenge in the world we have a really strong first quarter in we loan book
we credit metric be in line with recent result
we have minimal past due loan no charge-off and a reduction in we npa
we also have a nice shift in we loan mix as we continue to decrease the energy portion of the portfolio which now stand at 12 % versus 18 % of balance a year ago and this trend be expect to continue
the largest increase be to we C&I book as we successfully add several client several large client
now as the month of March progress we market begin to be impact by the pandemic
be in the middle of the country it be a little slower than on the coast
we first loan modification related to the pandemic be do on March 15
and at the end of the quarter we only have loan that have be modify
I would like to dive in a little bit to slide and in the slide deck related to we hospitality portfolio
we all know this space be impact quickly by the pandemic
but long term we remain confident in we customer base about a month ago be that occupancy have drop all the way down to 5 % to 10 % in many case
more recent report be that they be already experience improve occupancy level with the majority of property of ours reporting that occupancy rate be already above 30 %
of we operating property report that the last 10 day they have operate above 50_% occupancy
now full recovery for this industry be expect to take 2 to 3 year
on average we operator need about 50_% occupancy in order to amortize they debt
we believe the recovery to 50_% occupancy will take much less than 2 to 3 year
as Tom state we remain committed and confident in this segment and we loan portfolio overall
now shift to the energy industry
we have continue to reduce we energy exposure and be well position to handle any loss that may materialize from this sector as we present on Slide
bank7 have be actively reduce we energy lending activity for over a year because the industry be already deal with a price and supply-driven slowdown
now the pandemic have destroy demand and the industry devastation be be well document
the energy recovery will be slower and it appear that there will be a lasting impact on company and the industry overall
consistent with prior quarter we continue to experience migration within the service industry portfolio
we borrower in the service segment now they have be through many cycle but this one appear to be more severe at least go into it
within we portfolio the e&p and midstream segment continue to perform at a high level in spite of current pricing condition
I would also like to add briefly on we commercial real estate portfolio
we construction portfolio concentration have be at multiyear low over the past couple of quarter
we continue to focus on low-to-moderate price home and also expect to see a reduction in we hotel construction activity as project be delay while the economy recover
we exposure to retail land and lot be minimal and will continue to be that way
and with that I would like to hand it back over to Tom
thank you Jason
it be a good report on the credit side of the bank
so as we move forward consumer sentiment be go to be the key to the recovery
people be simply not go to venture out unless they feel safe
this recovery will be different for that reason
over the past decade the gradual conversion of we economy into a service-based consumer-driven economy be highlight how critical consumer sentiment will be to the recovery
it also happen to be why modeling be more difficult as older metric just be not as reliable
a good reminder of that be that manufacture now only account for approximately 11 % of we gdp compare to 70 % of GDP from consumer spending
we focus will continue to be on we fundamental
we will continue to produce pretax pre-provision earnings to create that strong foundation
we branch-light model have hold up very well in the social distancing environment
it be not a big adjustment for we customer and staff
we be not say it be business as usual but we be able to easily adapt
we have always be very close to we customer
we have be very proactive talk to they make sure they know we be here for they
we strength of deep customer relationship and interaction have be obvious to we and to they and we will continue to do so
we also know that government stimulus program and flexibility on future tax rate and measure will contribute to help we emerge and more quickly recover and we will stay abreast of all those item
we also will pay extra attention to we digital platform
System uptime have be good and generally speaking have withstand unparalleled traffic spike
we will evaluate redundancy and system reliability metric as we know that many people be now access the digital offering and stress we platform
so as we wrap up we would also like to say that we be see green shoot begin to emerge
there be flow of capital seek opportunity
we intend to be vigilant but also pay close attention to smart opportunity
in fact we have a few opportunity right_now that be very strong and very safe
in these time be nimble yet prudent with additional long-term customer opportunity especially with company that have work with large bank and experienced lackluster response relate to the PPP could use if we have not yet be a new main street lend program but we will evaluate as they go forward
so wrap up we thank you for you time and we will open it up with any question you might have
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and the first question come from Brady Gailey with KBW
so buyback be notable in the_quarter
do you still have excess capital with tangible common equity at around 10_%
how be you all think about buyback go forward
Brady we have be consistent that we view of stock repurchase be base on factor First whether the price be a bargain and second be it consistent with we long-term goal which balance shareholder return and have adequate capital available for expansion future expansion
as you know we have comment that we have historically we have see many company buy back stock with a view of boost ep not necessarily base on buy at a bargain price essentially more of a short-term perspective
and we have also say that we understand that people be entitle to follow that type of program but we strategy be different
and so when this turmoil begin we observe a severe price drop and we know we strong earnings and capital cushion be sufficient so we begin execute on that strategy
so with that be say specifically to you question we be not go to deviate from that perspective and that strategy
we do not have a specific number in mind
we do not have predetermine expansion plan right_now but we feel really good about we company and where it be
and J.T. make a comment the other day regard opportunity
and we feel like that the best buy we could make whether look at buy a bank with we own stock absolutely right
all right
that be fair
and then you mention you activity with the p3 plan from the sba
maybe just update we how much how many pp loan have you do so far
I think most bank be enjoy roughly a 3 % fee on those loan
be that roughly the fee that you guy be expect here
yes
so the first wave we put on about $ 45 million of funding relate to the PPP program
and we expect fee generation I believe it be around 2.9 %
so really close to in line with you 3 % estimate from other
okay
all right
and then lastly for I just the hospitality portfolio
I mean it be notable with you guy at a little over 20_%
I appreciate all the color around ltv and what the vacancy can go to et_cetera
I mean just bigger picture be this a portfolio that you be concern about over the next few month
or do you think even with a shelter in place for another couple of month this book will still perform relatively okay
yes
I expect this book to perform relatively okay to use you word
we be confident in these borrower
they have get lot of operate history
we go and pull kind of the biggest group and there be not none of they have less than 23 year of experience
and so they be in this for the long haul
and so be we
I would say too Brady that the you can not underestimate the drive-to market component compare to the gateway city like the coast of East and West Coast
and you be already see there will be many many more people that will get in the car and they will drive to certain place
and we have get that leisure limited service
it be not business convention hotel
it be not dependent on people come in from international travel
and when you think about that you can easily see that the portfolio be go to do much better
and as Jason say in he comment I think it be property
I forget the percentage or so
there be property out of that we have that be already above 50_%
and it be people that say I can not go anywhere
Texas be open up
and so let 's go to Dallas for the weekend or let 's do this
and so that be we portfolio
and I would add on Page when you talk about concern and you go down that road to whether people want to speculate if it be 90 day or 6 month before we be back to pick a number 70 % occupancy 60 % look on Page
and we have a 62 % loan-to-value ratio
and so if you think about it in these term 70 % of we exposure be at Dallas-Fort Worth area which be a drive-to market
so just a typical hotel it be a Hampton inn in the Dallas metro area and the property be worth $ 5 million and the borrower owe we $ 3.1 million
and so be we worry if there be a 90-day to 6-month temporary hiccup to they cash_flow
absolutely not
and this be a example of the dynamics of a combination of more of a blue-collar perspective and the dynamic market that we be in especially the drive-to segment
now one final comment I would make
I read a piece this_morning that there be a lot of belief out there that the Americas national park be go to be really really busy because people be go to want to get in they car and go cross country and do thing
and so it be another example of the importance of be a drive to market and a leisure and combination market and not business convention or gateway city like the coast
and the next question come from Matt Olney with Stephens
I think you mention in prepared remark that the overall level of loan deferment and modification with pretty modest as of March 31
do you have anything more recently as far as the modification or deferment that you can disclose in the portfolio especially around the hotel and energy segment
yes
I will go I have get overall portfolio detail
and then I will touch a little bit on the other segment
but overall through the 28th of April which what be today 2 day ago approximately 10_% of we total note have be modify
now they represent about 30 % of we outstanding loan balance and that be make up of the hospitality segment
so of the operating property just the program be and all of these modification that we have do have be 2 to 3 month of either interest-only or 2 to 3 month of no payment
and so in that group the vast majority of that be the hospitality segment
get it
okay
that be helpful
and then within the hospitality segment any be there any past due or any potential problem loan before March
just try to appreciate if there be any kind of laggard in the portfolio that could be hit especially hard give that they be already hurt beforehand
right
of the there be property that be approximately 30 day past due go into the problem or the pandemic I should not say the problem the pandemic
and do that loan qualify for a modification under or I should ask it this way
under the current regulatory guideline do that loan qualify to be modify without penalty
it do
it do
and we will see what happen with that one property
the owner be work on a few different option
so we will see but yes it qualify
get it
and then on the energy portfolio can you just review what what you expectation be of the size of that book
I mean do you expect that to shrink as some of these loan amortize over time
or do you expect it to remain a similar size
just curious what you expectation be
my expectation be that the exist portfolio would shrink somewhat throughout the_year
but you have to be careful here remember through the last downturn we be present with several opportunity that make sense for we to extend credit
and though overall I expect energy to make up less of we portfolio long term it would not surprise I if we be opportunistic and have a few really nice opportunity that make long-term sense to extend credit
okay
get it
and then I guess switch over on think about the margin and with the Fed action in March I be curious what you thought be about keep that core margin ex the fee above the low end in that range that we have discuss before which I think be around 4.50 % to 4.60 %
we think we be go to be within we historical range where be the low point the last 5 year
yes
I mean we think we be go to be within historical range
and can you just clarify those historical range I be think 4.50 % to 4.60 % but be there something below that that it could be temporarily
if you look at the NIM page what page be it
Executive VP Chief Credit Officer it be 4.37 % for core nim if I remember right
the Page
yes it be 4.37 % ex fee
get it
okay
that be helpful
and then you disclose some good stuff in the deck around the construction book especially around single-family construction and development and lot exposure and it seem like a pretty small amount
but I be just curious how do you typically underwrite those loan in term of loan to value and loan to cost
on the 1-to-4 family house that be 100 % center in Oklahoma City and Dallas metroplex
and so standard 80 % loan-to-value
those builder I be try to think I think we have builder that be new to we portfolio in the past year but that be bank by lender that work here that work with other institution and it work with the borrower previously
so we really kind of have a stable group of builder that we support
and it be a segment that we do not have any significant concern within that portfolio
and what be the policy around the lot and the land development loan
in general we do not do much of that but the policy be 75 % loan-to-value max but I would give you specific datum point but there be really not enough in there to create a meaningful statistic to quote you
I mean we typically the development that we do would be for larger homebuilder that we bank that be build they own lot inventory to chew up over I think in term of 2 year maybe 3 year max for they absorption but typically it be go to be 12 month to 24 month of absorption and they be the specific end user
it be more of a means to a end not really a product that we go out in the market
okay
yes
and I appreciate it
it be definitely a smaller size
so I definitely appreciate that
on the energy book I think you guy answer all my question
great disclosure there on Slide
I appreciate you guy
give we some update stuff around how you guy view the risk of that portfolio
so great stuff
thank you
and the next question come from Nathan Race with Piper Jaffrey
just go back to the energy book not to beat the dead horse but just curious if you guy can remind we how that portfolio fare during the late 2015 downturn and just maybe how that portfolio have change in composition
it sound like you guy have be able to onboard some new client in the wake of that disruption that we see or 6 year ago
so just curious how you guy look at the portfolio today versus back then and just kind of how the book generally perform from a credit quality perspective during that period
yes
if I can take that Nate we lose $ 10,000 in the history of the bank on net charge-off to the energy book
and then as far as what happen between and we be opportunistic but they be very short-term in and out transaction while people be accumulate property
and so it be in and out in and out
then I would say finally the one significant change compare to 2014 , '15 and be we have a little bit more in midstream than we do back then
get it
that be super helpful
I appreciate that Tom
and then just go back to C&I growth in the_quarter obviously fairly strong
just curious maybe how much of that be line of credit draw
or be it just kind of typical blocking and tackle and take share
yes
virtually none of it be line of credit draw
that be new client come online
okay
it be great to hear
and then just general thought on just kind of the general lower-to-middle market commercial pipeline
obviously some macro slowdown and headwind on that front
but just curious on how you guy kind of think about that overall book grow
I imagine to you point maybe energy and hospitality slow a little bit along with construction in some place
but generally speak how you guy see the loan pipeline today and that kind of extrapolate out into net growth over the back half of this_year as well
if I could take that one it be quite interesting because you be really into people 's psyche
and I liken it to out
and so we have this long experience and we have this great confidence and we like we book and we like we market and we see opportunity
but honestly there be not that many people that be interested in ask
and there be as I say earlier there be people that be more opportunistic
and they be start to appear but it be certainly not a big a large group of people
and so I think that that be go to evolve over the next 4 to 6 week and it go back to the virus and the testing and what be it go to look like in 4 to 6 or 8 week and you people feel safe enough and we model work
and we be go to be there when people be ready but we really be keenly focus on opportunity especially not to pick on the larger bank
however we have some really interesting I would not say horror story
but clearly the larger bank just do not get it do the way the community banking segment do
and that have already create opportunity for we with really good group not desperate people not people that do not know what they be do but people that be really strong
and so we would say that any meaningful growth I would imagine would be later in the_year
get it
that be super helpful
and then kind of along those line core deposit growth be pretty strong in the_quarter
and it sound like you guy see some good opportunity in front of you to continue to take share as well
so just curious if you expect that to also translate into pretty solid core lending growth over the next few quarter at least just give some of that disruption that you speak to Tom
yes
we would think
we would think it would continue the way it have
and the government program have be very helpful to the entire country
right
and then so I guess along those line with we at rate and a lot of you loan book I think you say 90 % at floor that be float
be there the potential that we could see some margin expansion in the back half of the_year just as that core deposit growth unfold and you be able to maybe run off some higher cost source of fund
it would be really nice but I do not think anybody in the room be predict margin expansion
I do not know J.T. or Kelly or
no
yes
sorry just to clarify not in the_second_quarter but perhaps later on in the_year
no
I think when thing become more normalize I think you could see the other side of the coin and that would be people push and say can I get we rate lower
okay
Got you
and again really appreciate all the disclosure in the deck
Super helpful
but just to clarify on the hospitality and hotel book you may have allude to this but what be the most recent occupancy rate on average across the portfolio as you have it today
yes
so what we have be of the that we be operate over the last 10 day I do not average it
I go through and do different break of
there be that be above 50_%
and then so be whatever that math work out to be I can not remember what it be but I just have my note with I
so call it roughly or a little more be operate above 30 %
so between and or between more than and then of those be above 50_%
okay
and that be all the total hotel in the portfolio
Understood
okay
I appreciate the clarification
certainly
thank you
operator
the total that include under construction nonoperational
and so when I be talk about operate property that be the property set
thank you
and the next question come from Tim Abbott with two Lions Management -lrb- sic -rrb- -lsb- Twin Lions Management -rsb-
congrat on the strong result and thanks for all the disclosure
so I guess first question you mention that most of you hotel sponsor only need 45 % to 55 % occupancy to amortize they loan
I guess my question be what ADR be embed in that assumption
be it base on ADR
we it be historical and we tend to gravitate towards revpar and so and I do not have a revpar number either
just to say that under normal typical environment the we spend a lot of time when we make a loan
we do a stress test before we make a loan and we make these assumption
but when this pandemic hit we go out to the top that we have and these gentleman have be in this business for between and 40 year and second generation and some of they own property
some of they have
and we specifically say where do you need to be just give we a number to reach debt service
and the answer be it depend on if it be a limited super limited service call it a Motel 6-type property or Quality Inn
it be 45 %
and then if you get up to call it a Hampton inn or a Marriott Courtyard it be environment even if they only have 50_% of the hotel occupy they can drive enough of a room rate and create enough of a revpar to make debt service
get it
okay
and that be one of the reason it be a very interesting parallel
it be very similar to bank7
in we slide deck we have point out on Page the one of the great strength of bank7 be we margin fat margin compare or wide margin I should say compare to other bank
and that be datum that be just irrefutable datum
well we customer base be very similar
these be not people that be highly leveraged or people that be in property with a lot of staff
they have very wide margin
and so there be much less pressure on they to run at 70 % or 80 % occupancy
there be similarity there
get it
and then my other question be on rate floor
so I think you say that 92 % of you book be now at a rate floor after the basis_point of reduction
do you know what that number be what percentage of the book be already at a rate floor prior immediately prior to the most recent round of rate cut I guess like kind of end of February
Kelly have that number
yes
it be 83 % prior to the rate cut
I be good
you all do a great job
okay
Great
thank you
prior to the basis point rate cut
and that be already
okay
get it
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- all right
as there be nothing more at the present moment I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comment
no we appreciate the involvement today
we be excite to move forward and cautiously optimistic that we be go to all get past this terrible condition that we be in and work together and we appreciate anyone that be along for the ride with we and we be keep all of we money in this not all of we money but we be substantially invest in this company and we have not sell any
so we be excite to move forward
Brad do you have any comment
thank you

as you know the_future be impossible to predict
so I caution you that actual result may differ from those that may be project in we comment this_morning
for additional information concern factor that could cause actual result to differ from the information that we will be discuss this_morning I would ask you to refer to we prior SEC filings include we 10-q filings for the first second and third quarter of 2019 as well as for prior year we upcome 10-k for and for past year 2018 and and we 8-k
with I today be Steve Shea Chairman of the Board of Blonder Tongue Laboratories and Eric Skolnik we Chief_Financial_Officer and Senior Vice President
we remark will follow in the same sequence
follow we presentation all of we will be available to answer any question you might have during the q&a session
blonder tongue complete with net sale of $ 19,842,000 which be a decrease of 8.6 % below the $ 21.7 million we report for
these reduce sale result in a net loss of $ 742,000 contrast with a net loss of $ 1.339 million in
these loss be a direct result of reduce sale volume in docsis-compliant modem and cmts product as well as decline in a particular line of digital video and code product and traditional hfc distribution technology
those loss be partially compensate for by a increase in sale in we nxg digital video signal processing platform and we new CPE set-top box system initiative
these result be in no way acceptable to the company its management or to we Board of director
the company have already take a number of measure to improve we future performance and be plan and currently implement additional change some of which we will touch on during the call today
although the overall result in be not acceptable the company do have a number of specific positive accomplishment and success during the_year that we be build on for and that we consider significant towards achieve we short and mid-term goal
but before we get into specific action take as a result of we performance I would like to cover detail of the company 's status and what we have be deal with regard the current covid-19 situation
blonder tongue fall into a essential business category due to we U.S. base manufacturing engineering design and sale of telecommunications equipment
that equipment go out to a large number of telephone cable and municipal fiber optic service operator around the country both large and small
the company have be able to remain open for business through the crisis
begin in very early February the company begin implement enhance cleaning and disinfect process on a daily basis at we primary manufacturing and headquarters facility in Old Bridge New Jersey
the team have be update those cleaning and precautionary practice on a constant basis over the last 2 month as additional information about the virus and its attribute have be better understand and report
additionally in early March we move all role capable of be perform as work-from-home to be do from home company-wide and adapt we operational process accordingly
I would like to thank we Vice President of Operations and Head of Manufacturing Allen Horvath for he foresight on these topic and to all he staff for all the proactive action that they take while the pandemic be in its early stage in the U.S.
I would also like to specifically mention and say a special thanks to we manufacturing , warehouse and shipping staff to they direct management and to we process and industrial engineer and we service and support team for they extraordinary effort during this difficult time keep we factory run and fulfil order
these be all clearly job and position that can not be accomplish work from home
and I would like to thank those staff for adapt to the difficult situation impose on they during this ongoing crisis
it be these critical staff who have allow we to keep run
also we thought and prayer go out to the family in New Jersey in nearby New York and all around the country who have be directly impact by this horrible disease
as a result of we poor performance during the company begin a active program in q2 last_year to identify and implement operational expense reduction and find way to operate the business more efficiently
at the same time we implement significant sale team reorganization and increase marketing effort to support the range of new product and product feature that we release during the year last year and prepare for those plan for
during the second half of the year last year we incrementally reduce we opex by approximately $ 200,000 per month and we have continue this work further in q1 ahead of the current COVID related situation
although this work be not yet complete we continue to develop further initiative for balance we opex with we project revenue stream in and we be prepare to implement all possible action towards ensure the company return to a predictable profitability as soon as the current market condition allow
as covid-related business impact go it be be a daily and weekly develop situation over the last 2 month
and we begin to see a small but specific sorry we begin to see a small but specific attributable slowdown in sale during the last week of February
that small initial impact grow each week through March and ultimately yield a approximate 30 % to 35 % reduction in revenue last month versus we forecast
we have immediately respond to that impact with a combination of short-term-oriented expense reduction include voluntary compensation reduction by all the company 's management team and we have delay investment and cost
we have also begin a process of renegotiate several supplier agreement for the specific purpose of allow we to preserve operating capital and maintain higher liquidity in the short term to help we through the immediate health and social crisis
on a positive note the company have continue to be in very active and open and encouraging discussion with most of we service operator distributor and integrator customer
by we last count over 90 % remain open for business and actively engage with we on new purchase new product and clinical discussion as well as prospective new program many of which be be plan be plan to deploy during the recovery period we expect
further to this the company separately announce this_morning about close yesterday afternoon of a $ 800,000 financing round in the form of a subordinated debt 100 % of which have be commit by a combination of company management and Board member
we be also in the process of evaluate additional financing option
we CFO Eric Skolnik will cover detail of this raise and associate benefit we have gain with we senior lender and more precise detail follow my remark
the company have additionally be focus on understand all potential government resource and program recently make available for company just like blonder Tongue Labs deal with the current crisis in the financial market
we complete over last weekend and submit a application this past Monday for the federal government 's CARE -lrb- sic -rrb- -lsb- care -rsb- Act Paycheck Protection Program for a request amount just over $ 1.7 million that number be base upon calculate by we base on government guideline
that application include a complete package of extensive support documentation
I do need to caution that the Paycheck Protection Program detail rule and requirement and the individual bank underwriting policy have be fast-moving topic
both the company and local bank who be administer the program on behalf of the federal government have be on a steep learning curve since early last week
we can currently offer no assurance or guarantee to ourselves or we investor that blonder tongue will be supply with any of these fund or any other government fund yet
because of the material amount involve in this program we will be provide additional status and other information in the appropriate form filings press_release or both as we learn more
and I want to emphasize that we will be run the business now and go forward in the most conservative way possible under the assumption that we will not receive any additional funding source
during the company do accomplish a number of strategically important item include expand direct sale of we nxg digital signal processing platform to a number of large and medium-sized service operator as well as product qualification and significant progress in the sale process with additional Tier and Tier 2 operator
we also complete and begin to ship at the end of q4 we world-class ClearView line of IP video transcoder that deliver fantastic video quality high reliability and digital television compatibility feature at a extremely competitive price point
those be be actively ship into a number of headend facility around the country and we anticipate that the ClearView product have the potential to regain at least a portion of we diminish sale in that sector that we lose in
we CPE program begin ship product to customer in February of 2019 and over the follow 10 month we secure direct business with over different service operator
although CPE have not yet contribute material profitability to the company it have be important in reposition the company more squarely as a provider of system above and beyond we extremely high-quality and reliable transmission and signal processing equipment
we have since be in the process of promote to those new customer the wider range of Blonder Tongue equipment for manage they future video and high-speed datum service delivery need
for we have begin program aim at streamline and greatly improve we work relationship with all we major distribution channel and integration company customer
these be great company that Blonder Tongue have in some case multiple decade relationship with and who continue to be key partner in we potential future growth
these program be in progress now with a fundamental goal of increase the predictability of those portion of we revenue stream
now I would like to turn the call over to we Chief_Financial_Officer Eric Skolnik
Eric

the company plan to file its annual report as soon as practicable
in the annual report the company expect that the report of its independent registered public accounting firm will include a going-concern qualification
although the company have actively take step to address operating_expense and liquidity and announce today completion of a financing and a favorable modification to its agreement with its senior lender there can be no assurance that those action and other the company intend to take in the_future will be sufficient to address the concern relate to the going-concern opinion
regard the above-mentioned financing effort and as Ted have mention the company enter into a senior Subordinated Convertible Loan and Security Agreement the loan agreement with certain investor the lender
pursuant to the loan agreement the lender have agree to provide the company with a term loan facility the facility include a initial aggregate Tranche A loan commitment of $ 800,000 of which $ 600,000 be advance at close on April 8 , 2020 and $ 200,000 will be advance at a later date

a different conversion price may apply to amount loan under the facility follow the date of the $ 800,000 initial tranche
the conversion rate be restricted to limit the number of share issuable upon conversion until the company receive stockholder approval pursuant to applicable NYSE American rule
the company expect to obtain stockholder approval at its June 11 , 2020 annual meet of Stockholders

removal of the block be subject to certain condition include the company secure additional equity or debt financing with the financing under the facility describe above meet the requirement of such removal
also we would like to report that the company have apply for a loan for approximately $ 1.7 million under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP
the PPP authorize up to $ 349 billion in forgivable loan to small business to pay they employee during the covid-19 crisis

the loan would be unsecured and bear interest at 1 % per annum
there could be no assurance that the company will receive a loan nor can there be any assurance that any proceeds of the loan will be forgivable
now I would like to open the call up to we question-and-answer session
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and we first question be from -lsb- Gregory Irvin -rsb-
wow what a difficult time
yes
for everyone
let 's see where to begin
number one I hope we can get the Paycheck Protection loan give that it be
we have make a combination of operate expense reduction include target efficiency-oriented layoff last_year and we continue those in the early part of this_year
they be very selective and very target towards we efficiency goal
and those all precede we come to understand the potential and now real impact of the COVID situation
since we recognize the impact of the COVID situation we have since take very specific nonefficiency-oriented but very specific target short-term layoff and furlough relate to match the level of business that we continue to see through March that I mention earlier in my remark
so yes we have
would the ability to get the loan from the Paycheck Protection Program would that cover I guess it would not cover the layoff or reduction that may have occur last_year but the one that you may have to implement now
so again all the action we take that be specific to the current covid-related situation we take they short-term action
the PPP program be give we the ability to potentially receive some relief in the short term to potentially get we through the I think in theory the bulk of the potential impact to the market
so at least I believe that be what the government 's intention be
so we planning revolve directly around that intention of the program
and it also wrap directly around what we will be commit to the government in do if we receive those fund and that be to run the business reverse all of the short-term-related action that we have on we current staff and run the business at full capacity for the period to help relieve the pressure on the economy and work towards the state goal of try to get the economy recover as quickly as possible
that be we plan and all the action that we have do in the short term related to furlough and short-term layoff be reversible with very short notice
well that be good to hear
have in the cutback of operating_expense have have that have you have to cut into the r&d that may affect the ability to design and roll out product need product in the market
we have do some but we have be extremely careful to ensure that the impact be minimal and we have do a lot of work talk to we employee relate to those reduction
they have be take with incredible care to ensure that the impact be exactly what it be intend to be which be very short term very target and that we can recover rapidly after we see the ramp
when we can better predict what we think the ramp be go to look like on the other side of this we will be able to recover that capability as quickly as possible
I do not want to go into specific detail but we have do it in the smallest way possible and in the most careful way possible
the do we relatedly do we have the product to match customer need now
I know there be some discussion of this on the last call
give that change the technology transition that I assume be still occur be we still able in the feedback that you get from customer and potential customer able to meet they need with the current product line and the line under development
well we believe we be meet they need and we be finish up what we believe be the final sort of straggle feature and function of we nxg product line right_now
those extend to the support of traditional analog television for output on we nxg
they extend to some other sort of affiliate
frankly I would wrap a lot of they up into sort of loose-end category
the we will be come out with that capability approximately midyear
we be work on a hd-sdi capability
so all the remain feature and function of nxg in particular be all base on specific both large and medium-sized customer request
so we know there be a immediate market for every one of those feature and function we be develop now and we will be able to ship those product as soon as they be finish in the r&d cycle
so if you fast forward to the q3 time frame we be roughly expect I can not foresee any additional feature and function of nxg that will remain on the road map after q3 this_year at the current time
so that really get we to a big milestone which be not that we can not sell NXG today but because we be and we be make great sale progress with customer
we be make good actual sale progress with customer
but there be those couple of loose end that be sort of check check and check box that qualify we for finish some sale cycle that we be in the middle of right_now
I think beyond that then we be mostly focus on wrap up the transcoding feature and function
we launch a great product line at the end of last year call ClearView
that be be we have have a great initial success with that
a bunch of customer have line up current and potential sale
so that be all look good
so do I answer you question fully
yes
what do you think will be the major driver go forward as far as product line go
I ask this might have show incremental growth over the_quarter but fail to do so
that be why I ask what be you bank on as far as product line go for growth over the next let 's say the remainder of the_year
right
so I will break apart banking on versus upside potential
so what the company be bank on be that we newest video and datum transmission equipment in the form of we nxg we ClearView product we bida product we cmts product and some other product show good sign of growth this_year and those be the thing we be currently bank on in the current internal company forecast and planning
the other product such as CPE bring a lot of strategic value
they have the potential for be a interesting business on they own
and we be work on those actively but we be not rely on reluctant those to happen in order to fund the business or fund the growth
go as you mention go to the CPE sale there be one sentence in you paragraph today that let I read that
it be provide a material it have not yet provide the material impact that be expect but it be better position the company for future system sale versus individual or function-by-function sale
could you elaborate a little more on that
sure
I mean the history of the company put really simply the history of the company have be to provide really high quality high reliability great value-oriented u.s.-built transmission equipment
and so when you be a system operator like a big tier or Tier 2 cable or telco or municipal fiber company you be deliver a entire system you have to put a whole system together in order to deliver service to customer
and if you be deliver datum service you have get to look at how that datum get through either you hfc or you fiber optic network all the way to the customer home or in the case of wireless operator they be do that wirelessly in some case
and if you be video if you be provide video service you have get device in the home
if you be provide datum service you have get some device in the home as well
so they the operator who be the end user of we equipment they think of they service offering as be deliver by a complete system
we have traditionally as a company pick choose choose individual feature and function of that system that we believe we be particularly good at design and build in mostly traditionally in the transmission side
and so it be in amplification and DOCSIS technology and it be be encode video encoding mpeg encoding audio encoding
we have pick different piece where we believe the higher value the company can bring to shareholder in the_future be by position the company to have both the transmission side the distribution side and some selective element of the in-home side where there be a high value and a high sustainable business
so that way when a customer look at we a service operator customer look at we they see more of a company who be look at the total picture and be more aware of the kind of challenge technical challenge and financial and service operating challenge that that customer have
so they tend to treat a system provider with a little bit higher regard and a little bit closer relationship than they do individual company who provide individual feature and function
so over the long term that be where we be try to do bring higher value and change the kind of relationship we have with the end decision-maker in the industry
I assume then that that be mean some reorientation of marketing sale marketing as well as manufacturing in-house manufacturing as you change you focus or you presentation to various customer
it be quite frankly it have not be a huge change within the company and the cost that we take on revenue
so I mean I think what we have what be help we in that transmission we in that transition I should say which be not complete yet
but what help we through that change be we have a number of staff that have background at the system level
so we already kind of have some untapped resource to apply from a knowledge base perspective in that area
incrementally we only add a few staff
final question I think final for now be the write-down in inventory
could you comfortably say what that be
what line that be or that those be and whether you anticipate anything approach the significance of this write-down in the_future
well I will tell you first but I want to hand part of this off to Eric but I want to make sure you understand
we have do significant effort since we recognize this issue last_year to make sure it will not happen again at this kind of level
so I can not give any guarantee but we have take significant effort to focus we attention to the problem reduce it work specifically at the kind of operational activity that will in the_future lend themselves towards the possibility that we have higher number of inventory turn on a yearly basis
and that be fundamentally the kind of the same kind of activity that will reduce we risk of be in that situation in the_future
but to answer you specific question on product line Eric do you have some datum you feel like you can
yes
I would prefer not to move down to the actual detail of that
but I agree with everything that Ted say from a prospective basis that we take in step necessary to assure that this level will not occur in the_future if we be able to succeed we goal
right
well it be obvious to I or seemingly like it be go to have to happen at some time because the inventory be just climb over the last 3 5 quarter
so it be no great surprise
just hope do not have anything as large as that again
and as you say get thing down to where the turnover be a little greater
it be a critical metric go forward it really be
yes
well you will have to excuse my I feel somewhat handicapped by not have the Q or the 10-k but so but I assume that will be out before you report again in or 6 week
yes
along with perhaps the proxy
we be not sure of the timing of the proxy yet but it will be the 10-k will be first and the proxy will be after that
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and it seem there be no more further question at the moment
so therefore I will hand it back over to Ted Grauch
actually I be sorry we do have one more question
we have a question from -lsb- Lloyd Sim -rsb-
a question on the sublease
where do we stand on that
the sublease be execute and it start in March and it be a 2-year deal
and so far we tenant have be it be be successful
okay
good
and just on the sba loan what be the total dollar amount
be it $ 7 million
$ 1.7 million yes
it be a number just over $ 1.7 million -lsb- Lloyd -rsb-
okay
and I guess look so the initial tranche on this loan it be on a 5-day look-back
so do that assume that we be somewhere in that $ 0.50 to $ 0.60 conversion rate I guess
well yes
we be in the process of compile the datum
so we just get to we want to make sure that we have the correct datum before we talk about the exact pricing but yes
okay
and I be just look here
so do any of the management team participate in the loan or be it just Board member
no no no $ 1.7 million $ 1.7 million
$ 1.1 million
it would be 5 day prior to April 8 correct
that be correct
that be right yes
yes
they both do
yes go ahead Ted
I be just say both management and Board member yes
okay
because I be just look at the 8-k here I do not see anyone on the management side
I do not know if it be under a different entity
I assume it be
perhaps we can talk offline about that
yes
it be there be different vehicle that be use to make the investment
okay
Great
the so total amount here 12 % per annum have you think about do a shareholder rights offering
no
we have not
how come
we have we have to raise the money fairly quickly
a rights offering be a very expensive endeavor and it require mail the shareholder and print out the legal document
probably have to do a s-1 that be $ 0.25 million
that be not in that be not in the card right_now
but you be go to be mail out the proxy and the annual report anyway so it could be contain as part of that correct
yes
but a s-1 filing be a different story
there be all kind of rep and warranty and legal work that go in that
it be a minimum cost of $ 0.25 million to file a s-1 and that be what you would have to do for a rights offering
in term of allow you shareholder to participate I guess in the upside without get the dilution any suggestion there or anything that you would be look at
well accredited investor we have a investment banking firm that be handle this for we
and if there be a accredited investor that meet the criterion of participate in a reg d offering that investment banker can contact that individual or that institution
okay
maybe you can supply that information
I can but I do not want to do it on this call
no
I understand
so you can call we afterwards if you meet that criterion
and it look like we have reach the end of the question-and-answer session
and I will now turn the call back over to Ted Grauch
Great
thank you for the question
and so I will kind of wrap up here
as we have in prior year myself and the whole management team and the Board would really like to thank all the dedicated Blonder Tongue Labs team member for they continued effort and accomplishment especially for continue to work through these very difficult current covid-related circumstance that have be impact everyone in the company in different way

the quote may you live in interesting time which some consider a blessing and some curse often arise in time of crisis
and those of we who will have live during some very interesting time know there be a beginning a middle and a end
we certainly empathize with those who be suffer physically emotionally or financially at this time
but we also challenge every day
at we last earnings call on January 30 while the coronavirus pandemic be on all of we radar screen we be not consider a near complete shutdown of the worldwide economy unemployment claim surge into the million on a weekly basis interest rate go sharply to near again and the need for trillion of dollar in fiscal and monetary economic assistance
on February 1 Massachusetts confirm its first case of coronavirus a University of Massachusetts student who have just return from Wuhan
Massachusetts be the second state in the nation to report a case
on March 1 Rhode Island confirm its first case which be relate to a return school trip to Italy in February
on March 9 Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo declare a state of emergency and that be follow by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker on March 10
as of today both Massachusetts and Rhode island be operate in a stay-at-home environment with only designate essential employee permit to report to work
all nonessential retail business remain closed and those that be allow to open be do so with restriction in place
I will touch on just a few area and initiative relate to we preparation and response to this pandemic and you can see that on Page in the presentation
the most important thing be the health and safety of we employee and they family
we be able to shift to a work-from-home policy very early on due to we strong VPN and Zoom capability which we be fortunate to have in place well in advance of the current environment
we remain as flexible as possible to accommodate those who have child at home or caring for a family member who may be ill
at present approximately 81 % of the company 's non-retail employee be work remotely and effectively
while traffic in the street be quite low you would not know it from look at the drive-up at the branch
we initiate a bank by appointment approach with minimal lobby access to further promote social distance for both the banker and the customer
we also stagger staffing schedule to minimize employee exposure while ensure business continuity

all customer-facing employee and those who be require to travel to company office have be provide with mask to minimize health risk to both employee and customer

a company 's culture be the sum of its action and attitude on a day in and day out basis of those who make up the organization in good time and bad
I be very proud of we company 's culture which be one of empathy for customer and colleague in everything we do and what we also call we core of accountability teamwork adaptability and leadership
they have truly be on display
I will now turn you over to Carl who will review the company 's first quarter result
thank you Paul
we company enter this_year and this crisis in a position of strength record 2019 earnings strong growth in commercial and consumer banking and a fortress balance sheet define by excellent asset quality strong reserve and a robust capital base
in many way we be head for a promising start to solid loan origination support by good deposit growth and fee income
we also successfully complete the merger and consolidation of First Ipswich Bank into Brookline Bank in mid-February
soon after the weekend of we datum conversion we preparation and response to the global pandemic become we highest priority
on slide we have provide summary income statement for the_quarter prior quarter and prior year
we recognize a net loss of $ 17.3 million for the_quarter which be drive by a provision for credit loss of $ 54.1 million
the significant increase in the provision be due to the potential deep and rapid decline in economic activity as we community practice social distancing school and many business close and nearly all event and activity be cancel
also significant be we decision to continue forward and implement the new accounting standard commonly know as cecl which shift from estimate probable loss to estimate loss over the life of the loan use model base on future economic forecast
we pretax pre-provision net revenue decrease $ 2.6 million from a very strong performance in q4 and as net interest income decline and operating_expense increase drive by higher professional fee FDIC insurance and seasonality associate with compensation and benefit
as illustrate on Page net interest income decline $ 2.2 million as we net interest margin compress basis_point
the yield on the loan portfolio decline basis_point as the pricing of over $ 1.8 billion in adjustable rate loan be significantly impact by the sharp decline in prime and LIBOR rate
link quarter decline in prepayment fee of $ 1.3 million and $ 153,000 in purchase accounting as well as a increase of $ 337,000 in amortization of deferred fee contribute basis_point in the decline in loan yield for the_quarter
overall we cost of interest-bearing liability decline basis_point which consist of a basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposit and a basis point decline in the cost of borrowing
if you could follow I to slide you can reference we comparative but summary balance_sheet
in the_first_quarter we have solid loan growth of $ 85 million or 5 % on a annualize basis and deposit grow $ 60 million or 4 % annualize
also notable be the $ 52 million growth in the allowance for loan loss and related $ 16 million growth in the reserve for unfunded loan
we also add significantly to we cash and security to prudently position ourselves to meet the potential financial need of we client
the loss in the_quarter as well as the modest stock repurchase activity reduce we tangible book value per share by $ 0.31
slide reflect the growth and composition of we significant loan and deposit category
in the_first_quarter we continue to have strong net loan growth in commercial real estate while net deposit growth be drive by noninterest-bearing demand deposit and savings
commercial real estate which include both investor and owner-occupied commercial real estate make up 55 % of we loan portfolio
dda represent 20_% of we deposit base
if you follow I to slide we have illustrate the near-term impact of the implementation of cecl in estimate the allowance for credit loss
at year-end we total reserve for credit loss be $ 62.9 million represent a reserve coverage of basis_point of total funded and unfunded loan commitment
there be component the allowance for loan loss which be $ 61.1 million or basis_point of reserve coverage on loan outstanding and a reserve of $ 1.9 million for unfunded credit
Accounting renewal be base on incur or probable loss in the portfolio formulate on historical performance
the new accounting standard which be implement on January 1 require estimate for loss to be forward-looking over the life of the loan base on economic forecast
we choose to use Moody 's ImpairmentStudio as well as Moody 's economic forecast to develop we estimate
we also choose to prudently calibrate the loan loss model to the performance of a peer group of Northeast bank since we historical loss datum be consider too infrequent and too low
at year-end we use the economic forecast as of December 14 , 2019 and determine the total reserve for credit loss also know as the allowance for credit loss or acl to be $ 78.5 million or basis_point of total funded and unfunded loan
this be a increase of $ 15.6 million or 25 % from the prior accounting methodology
at March 31 we decide to wait for the most update Moody 's economic forecast as of April 4 instead of use the mid-march version which be less severe
the calculate acl be $ 130.4 million a increase of $ 51.9 million from we day 1 estimate
this increase we coverage on total commitment from basis_point to basis_point
on slide we provide detail on we reserve coverage on funded and total commitment by key segment and select subset of we portfolio
the construction component of we commercial real estate portfolio experience the highest change in coverage rise from to basis_point at March 31 require a additional allowance of $ 14.7 million in the_quarter
we have also provide some of the key economic variable from the forecast drive we loss estimation model
it illustrate the significant expect deterioration from December to April in the economic forecast
unemployment for the full year be expect to be 3.6 % in the December 2019 forecast as compare to 6.3 % in the April forecast which have unemployment peak at 8.7 % in the second quarter before come down to 6.5 % at the end of the year
the commercial real estate price index also show a significant 14.3 % deterioration between the forecast
on slide we have provide industry breakdown for we major loan segment
note we have include owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial loan and also reflect $ 64 million of commercial real estate loan within we equipment finance business
investment commercial real estate of $ 3.2 billion comprise 47 % of we outstanding loan
apartment represent we largest segment
you can provide comprise 29 % of we investment cre portfolio follow by office at 20_% and retail at 17 %
we commercial portfolio be $ 1.2 billion or 18 % of we portfolio and within commercial food and lodging represent 15 % follow by manufacture at 12 %
Equipment finance at $ 1.1 billion represent 16 % of we portfolio which be lead by a focus on laundry tow truck and fitness equipment
consumer loan of $ 1.2 billion be comprise of point family residential and home equity loan
note we have no direct exposure to airline auto lending consumer credit card student loan or energy
we have also include some information in the appendix for the presentation of the presentation provide various metric and detail about the portfolio include loan to value and vintage which illustrate the strong culture of credit underwriting underlie we reputation for asset quality
we have maintain the same portfolio segment on Slide to provide insight into we loan payment deferment activity as well as illustrate we commitment to prudently respond to customer need during this crisis
we have provide 90-day relief on loan payment on either principal or principal and interest
and these short-term modification have no impact on we internal credit rating relate to these credit or accrual of interest or accounting for these asset at this time
in total loan with outstanding balance of $ 1 billion be grant a loan payment modification for approximately 15 % of the portfolio as of April 17
the largest impact category be in we equipment finance unit
we also provide deferred payment information by some select segment we be track
as I mention earlier apartment be we largest component of we investment commercial real estate portfolio
it be a area we pay close attention to
we have see little need or request for deferment
another category we provide here be health care also with few request for deferment where as a example dentist office be basically close and only do emergency procedure at this time
we certainly expect that activity to accelerate as office will need to catch up on cleaning and other procedure
as the stay-at-home restriction be lift we also expect coffee and donut to bounce back folk to be focus on they health laundry to be busier and unfortunately traffic accident and breakdown to resume
I want to highlight these be well-run business and we be all in good standing before the economy basically shut_down
we have also be very active facilitate access to the sba payroll protection program for we client before the first round of funding close on April 16 which we show on slide
the company-funded its first PPP loan on Friday , April 3
and as of Friday the 24th the company have originate loan with balance of over $ 518 million
portion of these loan will be eligible for forgiveness over the next several week and we will also be track and report on the activity next quarter
we be very proud of the tremendous teamwork adaptability commitment and pure do-whatever-it-takes attitude we see at every level and in every department across the organization
when the program reopen on Monday as you would expect we be back at it
however the volume will be significantly less since we be very successful in help we customer during the first round
as show on Slide the company continue to be very well capitalize exceed all regulatory requirement as well as we own internal policy and operate target
at March 31 we have capital buffer of 2.6 % or $ 183 million over regulatory well-capitalized standard
during the_first_quarter the Board expand the previously announce stock buyback plan from $ 10 million to $ 20 million
the company announce on March 24 it be suspend any further purchase and at that time have complete the repurchase of share for $ 10.4 million
slide provide a history of we regular dividend payout which continue this_quarter as the Board approve a quarterly dividend of $ 0.115 per share which will be pay on May 29 to stockholder of record on May 15
we dividend remain constant for the remainder of the_year
full year per share dividend would be $ 0.46 a 4.5 % increase over and currently approximate a 4.4 % yield
this conclude my formal comment and I will turn it back to Paul
thanks Carl
join we for the question-and-answer session today be Robert Rose we Chief Credit Officer and Michael McCurdy we Chief risk Officer and General Counsel
Brookline be very fortunate to have the expertise and experience of these gentleman particularly during this time and I be happy to say they represent the commitment and leadership I see across the organization
and now we will take question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and we first question today come from Mark Fitzgibbon from Piper Sandler
I wonder if you could first off you guy give great detail on the slide
so thank you
it make we life easier
I wonder if you could share with we maybe the area or segment of the portfolio where you be most concerned where you feel as though the borrower be most distressed and/or area where you think the potential loss content would be greatest
Bob
it be hard to pinpoint extremely precisely
but when you think of the thing that will return to health relatively quickly and thing that will not in we equipment finance segment I would be a bit concerned about a portion of we exercise studio
planet Fitness and other low-priced component such as ymca and jcc be about 50_% of that and they tend to not have fallout in difficult time
it be the middle price and the higher-priced one that seem to have that fallout
so I would say a segment of the fitness portfolio would concern we a little bit
we hotel exposure while modest in size at about $ 126 million be about 58 % vacation-oriented recreation-oriented
it be all in New England place where you can get to in a car or a ferry
and we have those customer have observe some cancellation of summer plan but we be hopeful that they will benefit from people cancel airfare fly to type vacation where people want to be closer to home and be able to get home quickly
the other part of that portfolio would be business hotel but they be all in this area
there be not that many of they
so those would be that stand out
okay
Great
and then and I know this be very difficult to answer
there be a lot of move part and such
but how be you think about the provision say in the_second_quarter
and any guidance you could provide would be super helpful
well I be not a fortune teller and I be not a health care expert but we be pay close attention to how we customer be do
we be talk with they all the time
we be especially talk with they in the key segment that be highlight on Page
we have also institute a program of try to project forward and 180 day out as to what the customer be think
so I really can not say
I do believe that this level of provision that we have hit because we take a very late forecast the latest one we could find I think this gain in altitude that we have achieve will be helpful in come quarter
I would add a little something to that Mark which be that cecl be new for everybody
it be new for we
and we take Moody 's model as they come through the door and we do not try to match it up with we actual experience in we portfolio and say we have get these exposure here which Moody 's be treat be harshly but it appear ours have be in very very good shape
we certainly take it as they come with that harsh outcome
okay
and then Paul base on what you know today do you feel like you have enough capital to sort of ride out the storm
yes
tax rate
okay
and then lastly Carl just thing on modeling
I would be curious as to you thought about the outlook for the margin and the effective tax rate
sure
regard the margin we have get a lot of internal model that we have be run
there be just so much uncertainty and so much variability here
I be not go with out with any external guidance on the margin at this time
as you can see we have grow the balance_sheet quite a bit with cash and security
we be also put on quite a bit in loan and offset that with a lot of deposit as well
so we will you can kind of try to work up you own number in that but there be a lot of variability and I be not really comfortable try to give you a estimate on what the margin be go to be
tax rate tax rate be go to be right around 25 %
we do have a discrete item that be a benefit this_quarter of about $ 750,000 associate with the CARES Act
so we be able to recognize that which have a impact on tax this_quarter
we next question come from Laurie Hunsicker from Compass Point
just want to echo Mark 's comment
this deck be amazing
I really appreciate you transparency
it be really helpful
just one quick question here
just kind of look back and forth between Slide and Slide I just want to make sure I have get this right
so Dunkin' Donuts exposure of $ 165 million be that primarily C&I
yes
yes it be
okay
and so that be what be find I guess embedded in that $ 180 million on Page
be that correct
Correct
Correct
Food and lodging be dominate by Dunkin'
and I will say to the extent that there be some real estate Laurie sometimes Dunkin' operator the better one like to buy little strip for themselves but the part of that that they operate would be include in there
but restaurant exposure outside of Dunkin' be rather small
Laurie thank you for the comment on the slide deck but you do catch something on Slide that 78 % exposure
it be really more like 90 %
it represent 90 % of we restaurant or food exposure
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from Collyn Gilbert from KBW
just start on the reserve
you guy take a really big reserve build and it obviously sound like you take a very conservative stance which be great
but just want to dig into that a little bit more
I guess the one part that I find interesting be just the assumption within the cre assume the reserve build on that book what kind of be the think there
and I understand and maybe it be as simple as just use Moody 's forecast
but I do not know I just I be surprise by the reserve build specifically within the cre book
if you could just give a little bit more color to the thought there
actually I may have be more surprised than you
I will let Bob answer it
it be really as simple as you describe
but Bob do you want to give a little color there
as you know it do surprise we as well
and if you notice it be a little punitive on commercial on construction and that surprised we
I think that they be assume that when you finish something and offer it up to be use that no one will come and you will have to take some form of loss
there be nothing particularly odd or difficult in that portfolio
in fact there be about $ 70 million of it be build to-suit that be go to be use by people when it be complete
so that part I do not think make a lot of sense
as to the other part of we real estate portfolio when you go through they they appear to be behave fairly well in rent collection activity the part that might be student the part that might be workforce-related the part that might be a and b the range of collection be close to 100 % down to as low as 75 % in that workforce range
so we be please with the way thing be hold up
the retail segment or the slightly mixed use segment mixed use be usually retail and other thing begin to see some request there but we do not think there be anything particularly not good about we real estate asset Collyn
it be we legacy business and we do have a lot of expertise in real estate around here
yes
okay
okay
good
and then any chance you guy have what the number would have be the reserve differential between adopt the April Moody 's baseline versus have you adopt the March
most of you peer adopt March
so as you say you may be one step ahead of everybody
I be just curious if you can quantify what that difference would be
it be virtually the same
as to the January the number that be the middle bar in Carl 's slide we be surprise that it have not move much at all Collyn
okay
okay
and then I guess just to round out the comment
I mean it be interesting
so you stock be down a fair bit today but yet it seem as if if I take a step back that a lot of these disclosure be just be really err on the side of you guy be ultra ultra conservative
even with you as you kind of segment where you have industry exposure that be not necessarily where you be see trouble
I think that be right Collyn
and when you think about a great fourth quarter a pretty robust first quarter put the provision aside for a second a little bit of a margin squeeze which be identifiable and manageable as we go forward everything be in place to repeat we past performance except for the pandemic and the new kind of provision policy the CECL if you will
that be what be different
okay
one last question before I get to a nim question be the I be just look sorry I be just look through this now
but I guess perhaps the one area of concern be to how higher education be go to look as we move into the fall
I mean you guy be on the hot bed
obviously you have a lot of academic institution
do you have a sense of what exposure you have to that segment
I know you mention it on that you be still see rent be pay on that part Bob
but just other exposure you might have to kind of academia student housing and all of that
yes
yes
look I be go to give you a couple of number here but I be go to tell you that this be a dragnet
we have look at the zip code for in and around the college in Providence Boston
Cambridge and Tufts over in Somerville
so it be a pure dragnet of exposure
and that dragnet of exposure would pick up about $ 220 million worth of apartment in those zip and about $ 100 million of so-called mixed use cre which would have a retail component to it
so you might call that and what $ 320 million roughly
but I will tell you that that be a pure dragnet and mixed in with student who go to Harvard Square and there be lot of people who live over in Cambridge that have nothing to do with education
so it be not correct to think of that as pure exposure but that be sort of the nexus of thing that we will watch closely as the_year unfold
okay
Great
and then just lastly Carl I understand you be not really desire to give any kind of nim guidance but on the funding side which seem like one segment that you do have a little bit more control over how do you see that trend
I mean you guy be still sit with cd I guess at like 2 22
it just seem like there would be a lot of room still to move on the deposit side
well that be true and we will see that benefit go forward
certainly we have a lot of thing that be mature but and we will be reprice down
okay
can you tell we where you either where you cd rate be at the end of March or where you be put on new cd today 1-year cd
Chief Financial Officer 1-year cd I think we may be in about basis_point in that range and maybe even lower at this point
we get with a little bit of special here and there with the we be not even we be see the appetite for cd disappear
folk be more or less get more and more liquid as we look at deposit
just to give you a little sense on that we look at we deposit account individual deposit account and break it up into decile
and we be see basically every category grow significantly since February
and that be really I think you be get a lot of the government stimulus money that be come in as well as people just be very conservative and save more and hold more liquidity
and we be see people move out of cd and basically put it in the money market or savings
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and lady and gentleman at this time show no additional question I would like to turn the conference_call back over to Paul Perrault for any closing remark
thanks Jamie and thank you all for join we today and we look forward to talk with you next quarter

participation detail be available on we website in the Investor Relations section
now I would like to turn over the call to Anthony Ambrose President and CEO of Data I/O
thank you very much Jordan
I would like to comment on q1 and we recent development and I will turn it over to Joel Hatlen for more detail on specific number
I will start by first address the covid-19 situation
for datum i/o the coronavirus pandemic have impact we customer supplier and we facility
we have develop plan for each of these while focus on we priority number one be keep we people and they family safe number two be keep we facility safe and secure and three be serve we customer
as a essential supplier to the medical and aerospace industry Data I/O remain open for business
we have be vigilant in keep we employee and we facility safe
we require most of we workforce to operate remotely while maintain a core on-site group to staff we manufacturing , service and support operation
we global team follow recommend best practice in accordance with and often in advance of local government mandate
local health authority be report steady progress in each of we operating location
and I would like to take this time to recognize the effort of we entire global workforce who have rise to the occasion and keep we workplace they community and family safe while continue to support we customer
we believe we business and operational strategy have prove helpful as we manage the effect of covid-19
we remain globally diversify which provide competitive advantage as well as a inherent hedge to location risk
this diversification span manufacture for a multi-source supply_chain engineering as well as in we customer base vertical market and customer support
from a financial perspective we enter the crisis in a position of strength
datum i/o be the largest company in we industry and we have the strongest balance_sheet
we be debt-free
at the end of the first quarter we have $ 13.8 million in cash or about $ 1.68 per share of cash
we believe we be better prepared than anyone else in we industry to ride out whatever may come forward and be take proactive step to keep it that way
begin q1 and early in the second quarter we implement cash conservation and expense management initiative include reduction and deferral in executive and Board level compensation
we also reduce work week for certain location and function
we will continue to evaluate on a case-by-case basis all government program worldwide that help we preserve we workforce and cash_flow at the same time
at this time however we do not plan to accept funding from sba ppp program in the United_States
meanwhile we remain committed to we long-term business objective
unlike other industry we believe the long-term electronics industry will recover and require a secure high-quality device programming as it recover
Data I/O have consistently be at the forefront of the industry
first quarter be no different as we continue to invest in we lead datum programming and security provision platform
we innovation and ultrafast performance and reliability be recognize in the_quarter
in addition we be honor to have receive the coveted Service Excellence award for device program support for the second consecutive year
we engineering innovation and comprehensive customer support seem to be resonate with customer around the world
during the_first_quarter we global sale channel and world-class product enable we to win system order at new automotive customer location in Asia North_America and Europe as well as be select by a global ventilator electronics manufacturer to ramp they production of very important ventilator to fight covid-19
we be very proud to be support the medical manufacturer and they EMS partner and announce the target program to provide we fastest support to customer build covid-19-related product
economic time and market may change but the reason we be select by customer remain the same outstand product great customer support financial stability and global capability
overall worldwide the automotive electronics market from which we have generate about half of we revenue for the past several year have be materially impact by plant closure
we have see China factory reopen although the U.S. Mexico and Europe remain shutdown
guidance from lead customer indicate Europe and America location will be reopen soon and ramp output later in the_second_quarter with the expectation of normal production by the fourth quarter of this year
within automotive electronics we continue to believe that the sector track a substantial multiyear increase in content per vehicle and complexity and design and programming requirement include the transition from emmc to ufs flash storage
you will recall that UFS be the next-generation flash memory use the latest automotive design to support they project growth and programmable content and performance
while we be still in a very fluid situation with short-term sale funnel put and take we conviction remain that the industry will need to reinvest
when that happen whether or not we be the last one standing Data I/O will be in a position to gain market share with the most robust programming innovation
for we other key target market and internet of thing the rapid adoption of work-at-home policy amid covid-19 underscore the importance of security at all end of the connected electronics ecosystem
you see report of hacking incident be way up not just with home worker but with the associate iot device as well
we sentrix platform a highly robust and flexible cost-effective security provision and datum programming deployment system for authentication device secure element and secure microcontrollers have experience steady interest despite the recent stress on the overall economy
the low capital investment sentrix model be become even more attractive to company to require solution on tight budget
we marketing mix be shift as well in response to covid-19
while some of we key conference have be cancel we will continue to look for way to expand we market and other venue and through other channel besides trade show with enhancement in we digital marketing platform
we strategy for sentrix be to continue to expand its presence and simplify and scale the overall platform in
we strong cash position maintain by rapid action combine with we long-term view of the market give we the financial flexibility and a launch path for growth as condition improve
in these uncertain time it be we intent to remain agile improve we process follow we product road map protect we superior financial condition and grow relative to the competition
with that I will turn it over to Joel Hatlen we Chief Operating Officer and Chief_Financial_Officer provide more detail on the_quarter
Joel
thank you Anthony
good day to everyone
net sale in the first quarter of 2020 be $ 4.8 million as compare with $ 6.1 million in the_prior_year 's period and $ 5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019
first quarter booking be $ 4.3 million as compare with $ 6.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $ 6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019
on a geographic basis international sale represent approximately 94.3 % of total net sale for the first quarter of 2020 compare with 94.1 % in the period
total capital equipment sale be 54 % of revenue and adapter and service revenue be 28 % and 18 % respectively of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 compare with 61 % 24 % and 15 % respectively of revenue for the first quarter of 2019
Gross margin as a percentage of sale in the first quarter of 2020 be 58.2 % as compare to 60.8 % in the first quarter of 2019
for the first quarter of 2020 gross margin be primarily impact by fix cost be spread over lower revenue and a 2.7 % reduction that relate to tariff on U.S. and China trade
the revenue mix shift to increase percentage of adapter and recur revenue sale as a percentage of total revenue benefit gross margin as these generally have higher margin as compare to equipment sale
operating_expense be down both compare to the_prior_year and the prior quarter period
the year-over-year change be primarily relate to variable expense include substantially lower incentive compensation accrual and sale commission as well as stock-based compensation
cost control measure also significantly contribute to the reduction
with most other expense category lower than in prior period
although r&d spending of $ 1.6 million be down compare with the prior year period it come in consistent with the fourth quarter spending as we continue to invest in lead the industry and provide improve solution for we customer
in accordance with gaap net loss in the first quarter 2020 be a loss of $ 554,000 or $ 0.07 per share compare with net income of $ 26,000 or per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019
backlog at March 31 , 2020 be $ 2.3 million as compare with $ 2.9 million at the end of the year and up from $ 2 million at March 31 of 2019
Data I/O have $ 1.5 million in defer revenue at the end of the first quarter consistent with the end of the fourth quarter of 2019
Data I/O 's financial condition remain strong with cash of $ 13.8 million at March 31 , 2020 approximately $ 100,000 less than at the beginning of the year
we day sale outstanding or DSO a receivables collection measure at March 31 be below we target range with the receivables reduce by $ 1 million from good collection effort from the end of the fourth quarter
payable be reduce to $ 3.6 million at the end of the quarter compare to $ 4.1 million at the end of the prior year
net work capital at the end of the first quarter be $ 18.4 million down slightly from $ 18.5 million at of
this benefit from the Cares Act acceleration of we alternative minimum tax refund from tax reform back in
finally we have share outstanding of at March 31 , 2020 as compare with $ 8,288,000 at March 31 , 2019 with the difference primarily relate to the share buyback that we complete during the third quarter of 2019
that conclude my remark
I will turn the call back to the operator to begin the question-and-answer segment
operator will you please start the q&a process
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question will come from Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street
just curious if you could comment what you be see from a order pattern standpoint in the month of April compare to the end of March
so Jaeson that be a good question
I will not get too quantitative
I will just say this
we be not see the end of the world out there okay
people be still buy thing
capex be down in q1
when we put we internal number and forecast together for q2 we assume capex would be impact as well
but it be not the end of the world
we have definitely see a impact but it be not like we have fall off a cliff or anything
okay
that be helpful
and then as a follow-up I know in the script you mention a order for a electronics manufacturer in the ventilator market
just curious if this be more of a one-off win
or if you have see sort of sustained inbound interest from the health care medical market as a whole
well we we have not talk too much about in the_past
we actually have a pretty good medical business
we have not break it out
it be be consider part of we industrial business up till now which be run between I do not know Joel 20_% and 25 % of we overall business for several year in that range
yes
it fluctuate 15 % to 25 %
yes
and then probably more in the programming center as well
but we call out the specific win because number one we put together a program for medical customer to make sure that they could quickly repurpose equipment to support new medical need
that be actually one of the big advantage of the Data I/O technology be with we pre programming you can convert from a part that might be support a ventilation system in a car and in 30 minute you can be reprogram now to support a ventilator for a hospital
we can convert the line that quickly
and so a customer come to we they have a problem
they would actually prototype on a alternative programming solution and find that the performance be terrible
they come to we with lumenx and we be able to get they about a 8x performance game
and they move very rapidly to place a order with we and get that to support they ramp
and the end customer we do not have the permission to use they name
but if you Google big government order of ventilator you can figure out of the company
we next question will come from Pete James with LJ Capital
can you discuss the margin profile by revenue type for capital equipment sale adapter maintenance and software upgrade and per click fee for SentriX programming please
yes
I will not go into too much detail
but in general the software obviously carry higher margin
Services tend to carry pretty good margin as well
the capital equipment it really depend on not only the type of system order but the channel
and I will give you a example
so if we sell-through a direct sale channel we will tend to have a higher gross margin and also a higher sale expense because we will pay commission
if we sell-through a distributor we will have a lower gross margin on that equipment because we provide the equipment at a discount to the distributor
at the same time we sale commission will be much lower because the commission have be take in the form of a product discount
so it be fairly variable
but within those broad parameter that be the pattern of we business
okay
I have one other question as well
you have mention the transition from emmc to UFS can you talk more about what this mean in the automotive electronics sector with near and longer-term perspective
and where you technology stand relative to what else be available in the market from you competitor
sure
so as you know the semiconductor industry from time-to-time adopt certain standard for widely use component such as flash memory
emmc be that broadly deploy standard in the pc industry the mobile phone industry automotive electronics for the better part of a decade
start in mobile phone probably or 4 year ago there be a transition to a new form of memory interface call UFS
without drill down too far it provide a much higher read capability a much better nonsequential read capability mean if you switch around from application-to-application you get the datum faster
and it also be able to operate at lower power
that be very attractive for the mobile phone industry and they adopt it first
and as the industry in general move towards UFS the cost pattern and reliability characteristic be consistent with what be require for the automotive industry
and they have be move a lot of the high-density flash memory application such as infotainment in Dash computing display thing like that to UFS
that be actually very good for datum i/o because we be one of the handful of supplier that can actually program we in the market
emmc pretty much anybody could do it
we do it better of course because it be much faster
but right_now we be of or supplier that have announce the capability to support UFS
and when we be able to sit down with customer we can explain why we approach have some very important technical benefit that maybe some other do not
so the move to UFS we view generally be very favorable to datum i/o because we have a unique technology position
and also very cost-effective for the customer
we next question will come from George Melas with MKH Management
Anthony you mention in the press_release and also in you remark that you have win you have new automotive win in Asia America and Europe
that seem pretty impressive
can you talk a little bit about that
I do not know how much detail you can provide but how big those be
and I imagine these be competitive win
exactly George
and I call it out specifically for that
what be otherwise a pretty dismal quarter for capital purchase
people just be not add capacity
there be still nonetheless new application
we talk about infotainment
we have talk about advanced driver assist
one of they be also in the area of electrification okay
which be a nice win for we
we hope it be the start of something very nice long term
we will see how it play_out
but we have instruct we sale team to continually to go after not only the customer they know but to pursue the new application
and the good news be in automotive there be a lot of new application and we have a very good reputation in that industry
okay
can you explain a little bit what electrification mean
what kind of application be that
so battery-powered car
okay
and be that some of you first win in that space or not
no it be not the first one George
but you would recognize the customer 's name
okay
Great
Great
that be great news
well do
it be amazing to get new customer in this environment
quick question about service and maintenance sale that have hold up quite well
can you help we you sort of remind we kind of what that be
and how be that hold up as well
well that include thing that be not capital equipment purchase and not adapter sale
so for example we offer software contract
we have customer pay we nre to do development of algorithm and other thing like that
we have maintenance agreement and thing like that
and of course sentrix fall in there as well
okay
and it tend to be a little more stable because we will tend to get a order for a annual contract and we will make up if it there be $ 12,000 for a contract we take a po for $ 12,000 and then amortize it $ 1,000 a month
so it tend to be fairly stable
okay
Great
Great
and then just on sentrix
can you sort of point if there be any sort of meaningful progress in the_quarter or some relationship that be deepen
and how do you expect centric to play_out in
well the interesting thing about sentrix be you would be hard-pressed to if you look at we inbound activity to understand there be any covid-19 effect go_on at all
we unfortunately lose a couple of we marketing venue that we be plan on in q1 and also in q2 and q3
a trade show be not likely to be a good thing from a marketing perspective maybe for the rest of the_year certainly through probably September
so we be look at other way to promote it
the we have have good progress work with semiconductor supplier good progress on the underlie technology good progress on new device support and good progress on end customer and channel partner come in with new opportunity
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question will come from Mark Spiegel with Stanphyl Capital
well as you you may remember we be value guy
and so we sell basically the stock on the way up but we be in pretty good now
so here 's my question and it be a general question
how much of you business be dependent on the volume of the end product
and in other word let 's just say hypothetically that they be use you machine to program the new Mercedes s class
and because automotive sale be go to be terrible this_year they sell I do not know of they instead of do that affect you guy
or do you basically just sell they the tool and after that it be it do not really matter how many of they they sell
well we be somewhat insulate on volume but we be not immune to volume effect
so automotive sale be potentially down would definitely have a impact on the people that buy for capacity
okay
and but as we mention earlier we have new win primarily where there be new technology involve
so for example if you be make a major model changeover and you be add a lot of new feature they have to put in place the capability to produce the car whether they produce as many as the guy forecast 6 month ago or not
now what we be see be customer that may be buy to a certain volume level or think they be and they be cut back they forecast
they be still go to buy but maybe they do not buy as much
maybe they try and squeeze out machine instead of add a third that type of thing
so we be not immune
but in general it be volume
but also remember it be the amount of bit program so if the feature set double the amount of software code then we have get to program twice as many bit which mean programming demand go up
and then finally the type of bit really matter
Security obviously carry quite a premium over standard programming
so yes it will have a impact
no it be not 100 % deterministic and there be other factor involve
how many machine do you typically sell for a give model
I mean be it like machine can handle car and or or
I just I do not have a grasp of that really
yes
it really depend on the application
for example if you be talk to infotainment you might need a couple of machine to support infotainment
and remember we be work with the electronics model from one end customer or many model from different end customer
so it be hard to draw a one to-one correlation that I think you be look for
I just can not give that to you
well be you typical last question be you typical order multiple machine to the same customer for the same application
so they might need five
and in this case they only buy four
I mean be it something like that
it be not just machine per application
I think the typical order be probably depend on how you define application probably or per application
but over time the factory end up with multiple version of we equipment because they be deal with mutiple model year multiple application et_cetera
of course -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- go back and forth
well that they could not avoid that
so if there be a new model year be they force to buy a new machine or I be try to I guess it go back to my original question
I be wonder and I know you say it be not one-for-one but let 's say the auto market be down now 25 % this_year what would that typically well I understand thing get more complicated and you do more programming
I mean off the top of you head what do that do to you automotive business
be it down 5 % 10_%
be it flat because there be more programming go_on
I mean I be just try to get a grasp of that
yes
that kind of number would not be good
I will just put it that way
I would probably have a disproportionate impact in the capital equipment
we would still sell adapter
we would still sell service thing like that
but the it be not a one-for-one correlation
and I do not know that I can give you a whole lot more detail authoritatively right_now
okay
last question I know I say the other one be
you say thing be not fall off a cliff but they be be affect
the_quarter you just report be sort of off a cliff a small if anyway relative to the year ago quarter
do you see this let 's call it low level of activity continue
or be it worse than this
well I think from a automotive perspective I think the electronics industry bottom out probably April be the bottom just in term of they overall impact
they be tell we they be go to be reopen
we have be get supplier letter give we some guidance on what they ramp be so the auto factory appear to be reopen in Europe and the United_States
I understand middle of next month
so that be a good sign
and generally they close probably the third week of March
so that would be a 2-month hiatus
so we be go to have to work through that
and they be not go to come back to 100 % right away
so the range of forecast that we be look at be extremely wide
and that be why we have take step to be ready save we cash
but at the same time if it turn around quickly we want to be ready
well okay
so again I will try to pin you down a little and you can try to unpin yourself
we next question will come from Mike Donovan Private Investor
Anthony and Joel I trust you and you family or safe
I be a longtime shareholder
my question be around I think a sentrix specifically
and it have feel like over time or at least at the outset that the sort of the picture around sentrix be one of a machine centric some reconfigure go_on some relationship develop with the semiconductor company in term of provision and then a little a different business model not a little bit of a different business model a very different business model in term of pricing per unit versus the capex
in some of the recent document I have read I read this term security deployment as a service
I also follow some of the headcount and the personnel the advertisement you have for skill set that you be look to hire
and I guess by try to jump to the end my sense be you have learn a lot about the need for security in the marketplace and you strategy and you execution approach be shift
would that be a correct assessment on my part
and if so what can you share about what you be see in term of what customer actually need beyond the equipment
well I think you raise some good point there
and remember as we learn we position the market get refine we have a very strong Head of Marketing and Business development Michael Tidwell who bring more of a software frame of mind to the table
and so he be be able to adjust we product position accordingly
to get to the basics what we talk about last quarter be the need to have what we call simplify and scale
the premise that people need security I think be be more and more understand at a slow pace okay admittedly but people be get with the program on security
the big challenge be how do they want to do it
and what can they afford
and what be the type of customer profile that we can best support
and what we have discover be customer want the whole security process end-to-end to be simplify
we do not control that entire process
we work with a number of partner and with the whole goal of be to simplify it
and I would be happy to walk you through the or so parameter you could decide to change on a fully configure secure element and it would take we a month to figure out what you want to do on that
or you could simply say I want to onboard this device to the cloud when it turn on or I want to authenticate it when it turn on and make sure that I can manage software update in a secure manner
and so what we be try to do be explain to customer as well if that be what you want then pick this pre-configured option over here or we have get a use case for you or a profile that might make more sense
and so we have begin the process of educate customer on and hopefully speak they language be a little bit better than we have in the_past
and that be really what I think you be see on sentrix
and sentrix fall underneath this 18 % of revenue when you look at a portfolio split between capex and adapter and software
we next question will come from Avi Fisher with Long cast Advisers
I be sorry to mention this how many sentrix unit be deploy
okay

and be you offer any onetime discount or financing option
no
it be a interesting point
we be really try to be frugal with we cash right_now
if I think we be go to go jump in and out of a v-shaped or section or something I might get more aggressive on something like that
we be go to choose to keep we powder dry at least for a little while
awesome
and one last question
this be we third straight quarter of grow consumable revenue
and I be just try to understand what takeaway to read from that
it seem like I know sentrix be in that line
that be correct
we still have deploy Avi
Avram Fisher item but I be not sure that be material yet
I know it reflect capacity utilization by some of you customer
be there anything you can offer to help understand this sort of positive trend
yes
it be a positive trend
but I would caution you not to draw too much or infer too much
we be in crazy time right_now
and as I have indicate before the number in any 1 quarter can bounce around
it be clearly a trend we want
we want the recur revenue to go up
that be part of the business strategy behind sentrix
and obviously sentrix be contribute to that
but the what I be say be do not read too much too fast
be it grow because of sentrix
or be it probably just because you customer be use program a little bit more and use more of you product
I think it be grow because as a percentage remember the CapEx have go down as well
the other thing that cloud that a little bit be we have a very rough q3 in term of we business level
and you see that that be be recover since then
Correct
so that be a grow use of but that be a growth do that mean you customer have work off the excess inventory they have
I think it what I be say Avi be do not draw too many conclusion over the last 3 quarter
Fair enough
and yes it be come off of a very low base as well which I be aware of
but I appreciate the color
at this time I be show no more question in the question queue
this will conclude we question and-answer session
I would like to hand the conference back over to Anthony Ambrose for any closing remark
May 18
thank you very much Grant
as there be no further question I would like to close the call by thank everyone for they participation today
I would also like to remind everyone to vote electronically in the upcoming shareholder meeting may 18 Joel
May 18
and I hope everyone remain safe and productive
thank you very much
the conference have now conclude

now I would like to turn the call over to Stan Ross
thanks everybody for join we today
I have get with I Tom Heckman the company 's CFO
Tom will do a quick recap of last_year 's number and fourth quarter number
and we will probably move rather quickly on into visit about what we still believe look like in regard to we exist product and also touch on we most recent press_release that we announce today concern the disinfectant that we will now be market to we first responder as well
so Tom I will let you do a little quick recap and then we will get into the forward-looking stuff
all right
thank you Stan and welcome everyone
I appreciate you join we today
I do want to let you know that we have file we form 10-k with the SEC this_morning
and it be a full recap of the year 2019 versus and I certainly refer you to that
I be not go to go through that in any significant detail
I will try and hit some of the high point
and I know with the current environment and everything that be go_on seem like ancient history with what we be deal with right_now
so I will not spend a lot of time with it
we will talk about what be happen recently include in the_first_quarter here and where we sit today
so anyway with that in mind I would tell you that on a bottom line about $ 5 million better than the previous year
and that be primarily due to the patent litigation settlement that we enter into with WatchGuard where gain $ 6 million in funding through that
offset by a $ 3.3 million increase in we patent litigation liability the fair value of that
so in essence that contribute about $ 3 million a little less than $ 3 million to we bottom line
so we have good improvement elsewhere
if you look at the top line really I think it be more indicative of factor
number one we be try to move people more to a service plan and platform rather than a product sale a hardware sale program
in that regard we overall sale decline 15 % but we service and other income increase by 25 % not income I mean revenue
and it be clear why we be do that
we margin we gross margin on service hit 77 % in versus 76 % in
so we overall plan seem to be work from that standpoint
we be shift more sale to the service channel rather than the hardware sale
and the second reason for that be we do introduce evo-hd in the middle point of last_year
and as expect we customer take a pause to look at that and evaluate it
it be a revolutionary new platform that we be very proud of but it have take some time for we customer to review it test it and adopt it
and in that regard we do do a press_release I think last week about a pretty nice order we get for evo
I would tell you also the domestic order that we get for evo
I will tell you that we have a rather large international order in the hopper to ship in March of 2020
that be and be delay because of the coronavirus outbreak
country and certainly foreign country have they hand full with the coronavirus
so I think the bottom line here be that we be see some very good traction
customer be very receptive to the evo-hd and the new platform and the connectivity of that platform
and I believe it will be the bellwether for year to come
with that in mind it do hamper we hardware sale in as well
so let 's talk about a few other thing that have happen more recently
we do complete a $ 2.5 million underwritten public offering in March at $ 1.15 per share
Gross proceeds of roughly $ 3 million
we be very happy to get that do before the coronavirus epidemic really become problematic in the capital market
so we get that do in early March and we be glad we do that
we first quarter revenue I will say be very similar to last_year which I think give the situation most people would be pretty happy with that
but for I would think for myself and I think even Stan we be both very disappointed in that
we start the year , January , February with double-digit increase over prior year revenue
we be see good traction
the EVO be start to hit a little bit
and in March we have several large international order as well as domestic order that be set to go out
we even have they on pallet ready to ship at one time
that get delay because of the impact of the coronavirus
so although first quarter be go to be very similar to last_year we be disappoint in that we do not get the opportunity to ship order that should have be ship give normal time rather than what we be currently experience
so also I would tell you that the Axon litigation we do a press_release that announce the oral argument be suppose to happen today
and because of the coronavirus thing and other factor the appellate court issue a order that they be not go to do oral argument that they be go to rule upon the briefs as submit by the party
Stan and I really look through the tea leave and it be only we judgment be we believe that be good news but we do not know until they actually issue
and quite frankly we do not know when they be go to issue with what be go_on when they be go to meet and go over the briefs and determine a outcome for that appellate hearing so
yes
but it be my understanding Tom that the briefs will be submit today
so that be still take place
in talk to we litigation team we believe that maybe because of the fact that they be not now go actually move a little quicker
so we still think at least from what we be hear unless there be they shut completely shut the court down and do not allow they to make any kind of ruling that we should see something I would say within the next 45 day
so it could be rather quickly as they be not have people walk through in and out of the courtroom
they could be sit around the table right_now and all party look at it and say what you thought on it so
but we do think that the fact that they do not and they do elect to go ahead and instead of postpone it go ahead and do a what do you want to say just say hey guy you do not need to come here
we have get enough or believe that we position we can get to a position to rule on it by just use the briefs
we look upon that as somewhat favorable
we would have think that if for some reason they be not interested in hear we side of it as we be the one that actually file it they would at least postpone and give we we day in court
so we be hopeful that it will continue to move forward and we will get something on that in the next 45 day
okay
thank you Stan
and I just get a couple of other thing I will mention
we be deficient with the NASDAQ listing requirement continue listing requirement
we file several 8-k and release that describe that event
Stan and I meet with the NASDAQ Board in February and present we compliance plan which we be happy to announce or I think we have announce already that the NASDAQ be very receptive and approve we plan
and give we until June 30 , 2020 to achieve that plan
now with the current environment we kind of expect that that will be delay because of everything that be go_on with the coronavirus and I know there be a lot more NASDAQ company with deficiency issue as well as we that the NASDAQ be deal with
so I hope that that get delay but I do not know that it will get delay
and we do not and we will certainly appraise the market when and if we hear from the NASDAQ on the exact date if that be go to be delay at all
I would tell you from a coronavirus perspective we have make some change in we operating plan include have people work from home
and I think you guy have see hopefully you have see the press_release this_morning
we have take on a new line of product to help we first responder deal with the coronavirus onset to disinfect car any kind of surface jail table whatever it be the product that I be sure you guy will want to know more about have be around for a number of year
we have a distributorship for that and we be go to hit we customer base with a e-mail blast today and we expect and we hope that we will get a very good response from that because this be a exciting product
it be nontoxic and it be approve by the EPA to fight the coronavirus as well as a number of other contaminant and bacterium and virus include hiv MRSA I can not remember c. diff salmonella
there be a ton of they
if you go to we website and can bear with we that it be get more and more information put on it virtually every hour
but you could get on there and get a pretty good understanding and there be some link that take you to the I think it be the FDA and the EPA the appropriate government site to give you a little more understanding of what it be capable of do
and just touch on it Tom since we be on it right_now be the product itself we have be knowledgeable about it and setter and do a little bit of preliminary I would say marketing and talk to a few of we key customer if they would have a level of interest in the product
and we be overwhelm with those that clearly say they have a interest
and in talk to we team and we realize that this be go to be a situation for sanitation the cleanliness on and on that be go to be look at scrutinize
even we government have say that they be concern about if we get past these next month or so that still need to be on high alert on cleanliness and stuff as we go into the flu season later this year that it could come back around
and until we really get a vaccine for it it be go to be with we
so with the thousand of department they currently buy from we that could utilize it the amount of taxi cab just there be multiple customer that we have and have all show very strong level of interest in the product
I would be we just literally launch it today and tell we sale team and we do have we e-mail blast go out here in a few hour
but just really surprise by the amount of interest and relationship with the bottle company or let 's say the master distributor that we work very closely with and have have a relationship with for some time
so we be excite about it
we think that this be a area that really could have a impact in we number
and we will update you all in the form of a press_release as we see how thing play_out for let 's just say the month of April
we will give you a update and let you know how many gallon or thousand of gallon or whatever the magic number may be we will let you know
but we be very excite about this product
yes
and I would just add a couple of comment and then turn it back to Stan to I be sure you guy have many comment and question about where we be head
but we be look at this as a new channel for Digital Ally to help first responder not only first responder but it really fit in well with the rest of we business
we have the event solution business the taxi cab the cruise ship
ambulance
ambulance
so it really fit like a glove with we current customer list
and obviously we be go to exploit that
but we believe it be go to bring in new channel as well and give we avenue to also sell they hardware and service surround we recording product
so anyway we be excite about it
we be look for other one too
I mean there be other product that we be look at that we may take on in a similar category
but look for we to try and improve revenue through other channel as well
so with that I will turn it back to Stan and I be sure you guy have more question for we
yes
and Tom as everybody should know that be on the call that we also have be make quite a bit of headway in regard to we new breathalyzer that have we patent associate with it that continue to come along real nicely in the development and we still anticipate be able to have that out later this year
so yes we will continue to look at mainly different product
I do not know if I want to say channel different product that can really easily fit into the exist distribution channel that we have
and then that will have a ripple effect lead into other area
obviously with we relationship and partnership with a lot of the entity from football to NASCAR those be avenue that will continue to we will be able to expand on with some of we product
and we also will be actually bring in sub distributor in regard to a couple of we product that have they own channel and network in place too
so I be excited about what we have ahead of we and really would just like to see like all of we thing get back to normalcy so that we can all be shake hand again at some point in time and be able to talk business across from the table versus over the phone
so anyways we will go ahead and open this up for the Q&A side of we call
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- the first question will come from Brian Kinstlinger with Alliance Global Partners
with the current revenue base how be you address overhead
and can you talk about with you business be essential but volume down where you can take operating_expense
it look like you be at about $ 15 million in which I assume include the $ 3 million in litigation expense you discuss
so where can we take that to right_now
yes
overhead wise we have pare down I would not say substantially but we have pare down in the area that really be flat or actually not existent in this economy right_now with coronavirus on thing like event solution and likewise
so we have make cutback both employee and overhead in those area that make sense
but I would tell you that certain area of commercial be rev up
private security seem to be do real well as well as we regular law enforcement business
so there be area that we have cut back in because those area be dead in the water right_now until the economy really open back up
as far as what to expect from a overhead perspective it will go down
but I can not tell you how much depend on where else we cut and what else we do
but we be look at every overhead expense obviously and try to make it right versus what kind of revenue we be generate from those channel
yes
a lot of it some of the expense as you can imagine instead of we go to trade show and other event I mean even all we outside rep be basically consider inside reps. I mean they be happen to keep the relationship by phone
we do a tremendous amount of webinar to try to keep everyone educate and get new business through those means but the expense of be out on the road be nonexistent pretty much right_now
so there be a lot of area that the expense come down dramatically let alone the area where we really do have to pare back as Tom be say that because the opportunity be nonexistent for a while
Great
and then in term of the disrupt supply_chain what supplies be you have trouble procure
where be they procure from
and be there any communication from supplier as to when this might improve
yes
as you might expect we do get some of we camera product from the orient specifically China Philippines South Korea
those supplier obviously have be affect but it really have not hurt we that bad
we have have some delay but we have eventually get the order quantity and product
so yes we have be affect
it have slow down
but we be get product from those company and supplier and we do not think that that will be a ongoing problem once the coronavirus thing kind of pass
Great
and then last question can you expand on the press release comment that you be evaluate acquire distribution rights for several product
just some more detail on what this might mean
yes
as we look at and see the level of interest in the current product that we be out there with it be clearly open we eye up to other potential product such as even hardware that we have the capability of be able to produce and could implement and sell-through we exist channel
so we be look at what all not only the current product but additional one along this line how we can expand on that
and again as I mention we be still excite about we breathalyzer hit the marketplace
we do have a next-generation of body camera that we have not pump the brake on at all
we be still go full speed ahead for it to get to development
we have the what we call the in a box or the fleet that be for over-the-road trucker
and that product too be right around the corner
so there be several additional product that we have we have be work on and other that we believe now with sort of the change environment that we clearly have the capability to get into
and again one I just need to wait a little bit longer and explain on but there be some even medical device that we have the capability of design and produce
I hope the family and all the friend out there be be safe and everyone be healthy
as you know I be on the island and we be become the hotspot
so my thought and prayer be out to you guy and you family put it that way
the next question be from Bryan Lubitz with Aegis
yes in you way as well Bryan
all right
so first thing I want to touch base on and then I will segue back to obviously covid but I want to start on the service revenue for the_quarter and obviously for the full year go up substantially from last_year as you guy be segue from be more of a product-based sale company to have that residual sticky business if you will
can you guy give we a mix of how much of that be actually from generate off of the datum plan monthly storage fee and how much of it be actually from I guess warranty and service
yes
the lion 's share of that Bryan be from extend warranty service and installation service if you will
the datum plan as you might expect they be cover over 3 to 5 year
so it be a much smaller number but there be really no cost associate with it
so if you look at shared number the warranty revenue the extend warranty revenue be larger and the installation revenue be larger
but there be virtually no cost very little cost on the datum plan
and that be so it be a little misleading from that standpoint
okay
so now off of that Tom in regard to gross margin and be that there be very little cost in the datum how do we get that number up
be it just by you guy sign new contract
or be that 3-year deal do it kind of preclude you even with new contract get that number higher and higher
no
I think the major effect on this_year and even last_year 's gross margin number be some reserve we take against inventory of the older product
we be introduce the evo-hd and so we know that the older product line would really dissipate
so we take some necessary reserve in order to get we inventory in line with bring on this new EVO business
so that be really what be affect that
I think now that we have pretty much get that behind we we know where we be head there
I think you be go to see some growth in the gross margin just from the standpoint that we have already take we hit on obsolete and excess inventory
okay
as far as you sale team be it I do not want to say a mandate but be it of utmost importance that they sign up customer with the datum program be that the margin be so good there
yes
well we be this new evo-hd platform be a connected platform Bryan
so by definition you sell on evo-hd you be generally sell a connected program a cloud-based program
we be also move full speed ahead on we body camera because we just do not make much money on the hardware for body camera
the real money be in the datum plan and the storage
so we be move head long into that and we be try to phase out the older storage requirement which would be local in nature
so we be move posthaste into that type of scenario
okay super
now I also want to touch base with Stan I believe you mention that you guy even have product on the skid to go out on the pallet and then you kind of have to pull it back
be that base upon international order where we border be be shut_down they border be be shut_down
what be the reason why that order do not actually get ship out
it be Bryan
I mean because of the virus they say look we want to put everything on hold
you mind just hold that until we see where thing ramp
because it be one thing to sit there and have the product sit on we dock versus sit on theirs because they still need to have we come over and assist in the deployment and get they all set up
and so it be not that the opportunity or the order be go away
it be just a matter of timing when the travel open back up for we all
I mean just to give you a example Bryan
I mean unfortunately we have one of we key employee be out in Colorado and just to Kansas have to be self-quarantined for 14 day
so it be just one of those that stay at home be even though we be somewhat exempt and have the ability to come into the office we be still try to do the best we can to keep those people that can work from home at home and safe
so it just get push back a little bit
okay
so I just want to be clear
no order have be cancel they have just be delay
yes
so here 's where I be at
I mean one of the thing as you know we give guidance of the $ 13.5 million
and I know that a lot of people have be pull they guidance
we have still see law enforcement to be somewhat strong
we also realize with some of the new product that we have come in and the strength that they could add to we overall number
I be reluctant to pull we guidance at this point as I believe that we still clearly have the capability of hit we number
and that be go to be a big year-over-year number as you can tell I mean we be still say that we will exceed $ 13.5 million
now you let I get another 90 day down the road and we continue to see thing put on hold then I may on we next call be a little different
but at this point in time I be pretty excite about still very excited about 2020
okay
so you be still confident in the number and that be good and obviously you guy be essential
one of the thing I can tell you just as a fact it be be report here in New York by the Wall Street Journal that over police officer actually have the virus
it be so I do not know obviously they be still work
they be still out there as a whole but those at home
the body camera order that you guy get from the police force down I believe in South America be that something where as we be see disruption with they as well be that they be international
or be that something that be move the full speed ahead
no
with they be international it be slow up a little bit
okay
so that be for that
but again that one be never in the in what I want to say the Q in regard to we number
we never have that one in that be not even on the radar in regard to we $ 13.5 million number by the way
yes
when you guy give guidance in October of last year what you be say be that guidance for $ 13.5 million do not include the body camera
yes
we do not know how that be go to play_out
okay
and one other thing Stan you have mention back in the_third_quarter when you give guidance and I have also see you on bloomberg and give some interview and radio dial in and thing of that nature that you guy be you expect the_first_quarter to be really big with new contract
obviously we have have some but you guy be really close to a nationwide fleet in term of a trucking company
can you elaborate on that at all
so that still the work
this be still look like it be come together
and what we do and have be do be work with a couple company one in particular that really have I would say the last ingredient that we need to finalize the recipe that we be put together for the over-the-road industry
we have pretty much everything and they be actually miss what we have
and so we look to try to get that still finalize right away and then that would be a very big launch that we would anticipate because of we partnership in a lot of area would have a very good and quick significance to we number this_year
be specific Stan be that related to the partnership you guy announce with mobile insight datum
that be absolutely one of they absolutely
okay
and now that guidance come before that announcement of that contract
so obviously if you announce something with the partnership with they that would be in addition to the $ 13 million as well
we know this be come into play
we just do not know how big it be
so we have be work on this for some time
so we just we have to see
let I have a good quarter of be able to be out on the street and then I will have a better sense of how to give some guidance
okay
and the last thing I would say to you be with you press_release today again everyone be be affect by coronavirus
obviously you guy be move into a new revenue stream potentially with the partnership and distributing of the DanaLite solution
be you guy go to just be a distributor and you be use you channel that you already have with you customer i.e. the ambulance and the police station and taxi et_cetera
be you actually go to be send in crew to do the disinfect in all of the work related to that product as well
right
at this time we be just be what I would call more of a master distributor
we have relationship with other that will be sub distributor that have different marketing channel that could utilize the product as well
but we clearly have a very nice agreement and with room to bring on some additional sub distributor
and at that point in time that will be we role
now some of these end user would be those that would be utilize the product for clean facility and as such
but we do not see we walk in there do that at this point
so you do not have to worry about obviously get you workforce suit up and mass up and actually fly around the country you be just go to ship the product via you partnership with the solution DanaLite
right right
I think what we will do be continue to provide the product
and then those that have a lot more experience at it than we let they go ahead and do the actual application
okay
and now as far as that market be concern obviously here again Long Island New York be kind of a epicenter
we be all kind of get it be very fluid let 's put it that way the whole situation of the coronavirus
but you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out thing that America need to get back to work be go to be testing and obviously cleaning
how big do you see this market be for this type of a product
I mean do you guy see it move into school and hospital
or be it just go to be police and ambulance
Bryan we have have number that we believe if they play_out because you do know that we do have relationship with school taxi cab ambulance police cruise ship on and on and on that I do not want to say something that be just crazy
but I mean you guy can put and together
I mean it may you may see it at least for reinvent the company in some fashion and I would hate to say this but to where you guy be call up and say how many ten of thousand hundred of thousand gallon do you sell this_quarter versus how many body camera
I mean it be the hot item right_now
and some of the preliminary number that we hear that some of we end user be go through and would like to give we a shot be just mind-boggling how big they can be
so right I do not I really do not want to touch it
you guy be go to have to put and together on that one
I will make sure and again I will try to give a update at the end of the month when I have get the number and just do something in the form of a press_release as ask everyone that we have be very pleased with the launch
to date we have see order and shipment in excess of x whatever that may be
so that will give you as much visibility as I can give you
the next question be from Allan Lyons with Vestal Venture Capital
Stan and Tom I be glad to hear you guy be all safe and healthy at this tremulous time for sure
the question I have I notice you have $ 4.8 million warrant outstanding assume you can have you give any consideration to reduce the exercise price for 1 month and that people exercise that let 's say at the current price they can do it
and if they do not it revert back to the original term
that some of that be be throw around as a option
and instead of do anything new and additional dilution for be something new come off the table I think what sort of where we be postured right_now be just really want to see how a couple of event play_out
I mean let 's just say that we be fortunate enough to have ruling and fortunate enough that the ruling go in we favor in regard to the appeal I would think it would have a very very very strong impact on the stock
and so a lot of those warrant would be get exercise at I believe at full price
so we have take into consideration what you be say and how to play the card every day
but that be a great comment that you make there
I understand
and you do not want to do it prematurely
but obviously cash be king here and depend how these turn out you do not know
so I be glad you be think about it and that be for you guy to decide
listen I want to thank everybody for call in today and all the great question
on behalf of Digital Ally and all of we employee we too wish everyone the best and to be safe and I can not thank we first responder and all we healthcare worker and so many people that be still out there on the front line do what they can for the betterment of we all
so we appreciate everybody 's effort and we will do the best to keep everyone inform on how we be do
and everybody be safe and we will talk to you soon
thank you

we volume exclude Hydrocarbons & Energy decline 1 % reflect the impact of reduce economic activity in China with the onset of the covid-19_pandemic and containment intervention
we volume in China be down 25 % sequentially as seasonal decline due to the chinese New year be intensify by the sudden demand reduction due to the virus
cash_flow be again a noteworthy headline
we generate a solid $ 1.2 billion in cash from continue operation a 79 % conversion of operate ebitda to cash from operation and we free cash_flow increase by $ 240 million year-over-year
this be underpin by action one we quick response to shift trend in global energy price and regional demand which enable we to liberate cash from work capital two tight capital and expense control include more than $ 30 million in stranded cost savings and three a nonoperational cash inflow as we recover a $ 259 million tax withholding from the canadian tax authority relate to the judgment against Nova
we end the_quarter with approximately $ 12 billion of cash and available liquidity and we take further action to reinforce we financial strength and flexibility
early in the quarter we opportunistically execute a eur 2.25 billion euro-denominated debt issuance achieve a weighted average coupon of about 1 %

turn to slide
safety be always we first priority at Dow
and protect the health and safety of we employee and community be the first thing we do
we rapidly deploy we crisis management framework and activate site-by-site plan to maintain business continuity and secure safe reliable operation
today of we workforce be work from home and Dow site continue to operate with reinforce health safety and security protocol
in fact close to 100 % of we site be operational
in addition we business and government affair team be work with federal state and local official and agency to share best practice and help unlock solution to enable the continued flow of critical goods and product as well as recommendation for how to get the economy reopen safely
move to slide
as a industry consider essential to global infrastructure the chemical industry and
Dow have a critical role to play

the outpouring of support from we workforce have be inspiring
and we be give they creative way to provide they time and expertise above and beyond the thing that they be already do to help Dow and we customer
I will close my comment on the_first_quarter with a quick review of we segment result on slide
packaging & Specialty Plastics operate ebit be $ 580 million down from the year-ago period
the benefit of consumer-led packaging demand growth and additional stranded cost savings be more than offset by lower polyethylene and global energy price as well as reduce equity earnings
the packaging & Specialty Plastics business deliver a 1 % volume growth support by strong end-market demand particularly in health and hygiene rigid packaging and flexible food and specialty packaging application
the business deliver volume gain in Asia Pacific versus the year-ago period despite the demand reduction in China from the onset of the covid-19_pandemic
Hydrocarbons & Energy report both lower volume and price
volume decline be primarily due to reduce ethylene sale from increase internal derivative consumption
Industrial Intermediates Infrastructure operate ebit be $ 175 million down from the year-ago period as demand growth in the Industrial Solutions business be more than offset by margin compression in polyurethane application as well as equity loss
the segment also benefit from lower year-over-year plan maintenance turnaround cost
the Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business report lower net sale primarily drive by lower global energy price and decrease demand particularly in furniture and bedding automotive appliance and aircraft deicing application
Industrial Solutions report volume growth support by strong demand in surfactant and solvent use in cleaning application
volume grow in all geographic region except EMEAI which report a modest decline
and finally Performance Materials Coatings operate ebit be $ 162 million as volume growth in coating end market be offset by a decline in silicone application and local price decrease
Consumer Solutions report demand growth in upstream siloxane and home and personal care end market in the U.S. and Canada
however these be more than offset by volume decline in other region which include the impact of covid-19 in Asia Pacific
Coatings & Performance Monomers report volume growth primarily drive by increase demand in Performance Monomers
Coatings volume grow in the U.S. and Canada lead by road marking and wood coating but be more than offset by reduce architectural coating demand in Asia Pacific and EMEAI drive by impact from covid-19
finally I want to showcase the swift and early action the Dow management team continue to take as these unprecedented event play_out
we be actively work to preserve we financial strength and flexibility while also maintain business continuity
and so today we be announce another set of proactive measure which be summarize on Slide
let I be clear Dow 's operational and financial playbook have put we in a very good position
the action we be announce today build upon we focus to provide additional agility drive cash generation and adjust we spending to current reality
to that end the follow near-term intervention be already underway and will gain momentum as we move through the remainder of the_year
we have target a further $ 500 million release of cash from work capital
we be reduce expense by $ 350 million and we be decrease we capital expenditure target to $ 1.25 billion a reduction of $ 750 million versus last_year
we be achieve this further reduction in a way that will maintain we long-term competitiveness and we most attractive growth project
also we be take action to idle facility or reduce operating rate in line with demand trend in the U.S. Europe and Latin America
we be work with we customer to get order place with enough lead time so that we can make the best asset decision across we network and manage bottleneck in the supply_chain to deliver product where it be need
in plastic to balance production to current demand we be temporarily idle polyethylene and elastomer production unit for at least 30 day
the plant have a aggregate annualize capacity of approximately 2 billion pound and be located on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Argentina
this equate to approximately 10_% of the business global annual capacity
we polyurethane business have strong participation in durable goods segment such as automotive furniture and bedding appliance and construction
these segment be be heavily impact by government-mandated shutdown around the world
as a result we be run we polyurethane asset include propylene oxide and MDI at reduce operating rate
and in silicone we be run reduce rate across we global grid of siloxane train and we Zhangjiagang production facility in China will remain down on a extended planned turnaround into May
we also benefit from full flexibility at we silicone finish asset allow we to quickly respond to demand in all formulate silicone application around the world
we be take these action with a thoughtful approach that will allow we to quickly respond as demand improve when economy around the world reopen
and while the timing and shape of a recovery remain uncertain these action position Dow to emerge even stronger when the global economy rebound
with that let I hand it over to Howard
thanks Jim and good morning everyone
turn to slide
I will start with a update on a key milestone reach at Sadara
on we last earnings call we share that Sadara be very close to sign its final logistics service agreement
I be pleased to report the jv have now achieve that milestone
this agreement be important as it be the final substantive step to project completion
as a result Sadara and the jv partner have now begin the debt re-profiling process and be in parallel currently engage in discussion with its lender
we expect this dialogue to advance over the course of this_year and we will provide further update as that unfold
while that financing discussion be progress Sadara be make good progress on execute its longer term operating structure improvement
and from this_year Dow remain on track with its planned loan to Sadara which remain in the range of $ 500 million
move to slide
net sale be $ 9.8 billion
at the company level local price decline 8 % year-over year drive primarily by lower global energy price
Currency decrease sale by 1 %
volume decline 2 % year-over-year or 1 % exclude the Hydrocarbons & Energy business
equity loss be $ 89 million primarily drive by lower result at the Kuwait and Thai joint venture
operate ebit be $ 843 million and operate ep be $ 0.59
positive driver during the_quarter include demand growth in food packaging health and hygiene and cleaning application on resilient consumer purchase trend in response to covid-19 as well as continue stranded cost removal
these gain be more than offset by year-over-year margin compression notably in the polyurethane and silicone chain as well as lower equity earnings
overall the financial impact of covid-19 and the substantial decline in crude oil price be in line with we expectation of a approximately $ 200 million headwind in the_quarter
move to cash_flow
we generate $ 1.2 billion of cash from continue operation and increase we free cash_flow by $ 240 million versus the year-ago period
we earnings to cash conversion of 79 % represent a significant improvement year-over-year
all of these metric be help by a solid release of cash from work capital lower transaction cost as well as the cash inflow from recovery of $ 259 million from the canadian tax authority related to the judgment against Nova
finally we allocate we free cash_flow in a balanced way in line with we capital allocation priority
in addition to the dividend we repurchase $ 125 million of we own share
go forward as a prudent measure give the economic uncertainty we be temporarily suspend we share repurchase for the balance of the_year
we will however continue to reevaluate this lever in light of macro trend and we free cash flow generation
move to slide
Dow remain well-equipped to navigate the current environment and ensure we financial flexibility through the cycle
we end the_first_quarter with nearly $ 12 billion in total liquidity include $ 3.6 billion in cash and equivalent
in the_first_quarter we prudently draw down $ 800 million on we uncommitted line to further bolster we cash position
recall that last_year we extend we $ 5 billion revolver out to
and importantly all of we more than $ 8 billion of committed facility remain untapped
with we solid liquidity position we have clear capital allocation priority to maximize value ensure safe and reliable operation continue to be we # 1 priority
and financially the dividend be we top priority follow by additional debt paydown
in fact over the past year you have see we take proactive liability management action include over $ 3 billion of gross debt reduction in and extension to we maturity profile and we continue this practice this past quarter
we opportunistically tap the Eurobond market issue eur 2.25 billion of debt at a all-in rate of approximately 1 %
we use the proceeds to repay debt and further extend we mature profile
as a result today we have no substantive long-term debt maturity due over the next 3 year
these action have also benefit earnings as we net interest expense run rate be now more than $ 100 million lower than and $ 200 million lower than
as you can see we financial strength and flexibility provide we solid foundation to navigate the current environment
and you should expect we to continue be active and opportunistic in further fortify we financial position
before I move into modeling guidance I want to take a minute to discuss how we view the_quarter ahead and the range of potential scenario we be plan for
these be clearly uncertain and unprecedented time
and due to the limited forward visibility we feel it even more critical that we provide a assessment use the best information available to we year-to-date how the_second_quarter and the rest of the_year could unfold and the assumption behind we range of potential outcome
we forward guidance be base on we expectation that virus containment will continue in the come week and the global economy will gradually and sustainably resume as industry and business return to work and global government stimulus take hold
the progression of containment and recovery that we see in China be now play_out in Europe and we expect similar pattern to evolve in the U.S. and other country
so we corridor of potential outcome assume that the_second_quarter will show the largest global economic and chemical industry impact from covid-19 and the collapse in energy price
use China as a reference we modeling guidance assume recovery for Dow begin as economy reopen
report suggest that overall activity in China do improve quickly year-over-year in February to March but improvement have be uneven across industry
should the restart of the global economy be materially different than we assumption we intend to provide you with update as the_quarter progress
with that be say let 's move to slide where we highlight adjustment to the full year item we share in January base on current reality
as Jim mention in he comment we earnings should benefit from tailwind of $ 350 million of expense reduction
we expect higher equity loss as we jv also face similar trend as we core business
and we now expect a higher tax rate due to shift in the geographic mix of earnings in we core business as well as lower equity earnings
to preserve flexibility in this slower macro environment we have reduce we capex spending target by $ 750 million versus
we will have a cash tailwind of more than $ 400 million related to lower integration and separation cost for the balance of the_year
and as I mention before we have put further share repurchase temporarily on hold at least until we get better visibility on cash_flow
get into the detail of the_quarter ahead let 's please turn to slide
we see second quarter sale in the range of $ 7.5 billion to $ 8.5 billion on we assumption of demand production peak in the_second_quarter with the spread of covid-19 and slow economic activity globally
we have outline on the slide we current sale expectation by segment in we normal fashion
we be also provide corridor this_quarter along with high and low-volume estimate so you understand the range of scenario we see as possible for each segment
this be a attempt to give you a level of forward visibility in a very difficult period of forecast
let I please reemphasize though these be estimate only
as usual we be highlight the key ebit driver in the_quarter on a sequential basis
in the packaging Specialty Plastics segment while we expect continue robust consumer-driven demand for we food health and hygiene and packaging application we see this be more than offset by demand softness in automotive and infrastructure application as well as lower average energy price
with the dramatic shift in oil dynamics we expect naphtha crack to continue its advantage which should support we european cracker margin as well as keep demand relatively resilient there
and we action in the Americas to idle capacity should help balance supply and demand until the economy around the world reopen
in the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment we be see high demand in the Industrial Solutions for we solvent and surfactant that make cleaning product effective to combat covid-19
however we expect that to only partly offset trough mdi spread and weakness in end-market demand for we polyurethane product particularly in consumer durable , construction and automotive application
and finally in Performance Materials Coatings we expect demand softness for industrial application and coating as well as weakened fundamental in we upstream siloxane and acrylic building block which be experience a challenging pricing environment on weak supply and demand fundamental
during the_second_quarter we also anticipate we will begin to feel the positive effect of China continue to slowly reverse the decline of the_first_quarter
and as the global economy continue to come back online beyond the_second_quarter we also expect to see the discrete impact relate to the virus begin to reverse globally
I would like to just stress again that the near-term guidance you see here be base on we assumption for how the covid-19 containment and recovery could play_out as we move through the_second_quarter and be base on the outline assumption
give the limited visibility we will remain strongly focus on cash_flow and protect we enterprise priority
with that I will turn it back to Jim
thank you Howard
turn to slide
I want to emphasize several factor that we believe set Dow apart and support we competitive position
give we more than 120-year history Dow have a strong track record of successfully navigate period of uncertainty
and as a result we have build competitive position and asset flexibility to be prepare for situation like those that we be experience today
we call these we point of distinction
and today I will highlight a few point that set Dow apart
on slide Dow 's unmatched feedstock flexibility and superior product mix be key factor that underpin the higher and more resilient margin that we deliver across the cycle
we also have a geographic mix of asset that provide a structural hedge to feedstock dynamics
for example in today 's environment we be able to capture improved crack margin in Europe and Southeast Asia which offset some of the margin compression we see in other region
we have a lead packaging Specialty Plastics portfolio with asset design to be flexible and adapt to feedstock volatility
we feedstock flexibility enable we to crack a wider mix of feedstock
for example we have 2 to 3x more propane capability than we peer
we can implement this at a furnace-by-furnace level in we cracker
as heavier feedstock like naphtha become advantaged another limitation could be co-product
if not manage adequately ethylene unit may be force to cut rate or switch feedstock
and we have see some sign of these strain in the industry as demand for co-product be tie to automotive and fuel end market which be currently experience weak demand
but here too Dow have advantage
we have aromatic process unit in Europe and on the U.S. Gulf Coast which give we flexibility to consume and process Thai gas from the cracker
we have capability of handle increase c4 stream from the cracker which include co-cracking to reprocess the c4 in we furnace
in short we feedstock flexibility and co-product management capability prove they worth over the cycle time and time again and this period be no different
these capability preserve we low cost-to-serve position regardless of which feedstock scenario be advantage
further downstream we product mix be another differentiate factor
we mix of polyethylene and functional polymer product deliver a more resilient and higher-margin profile which begin to stand out in softer period like we start to see in and we be see today
the benchmarking we have deliver over the past 2 year have highlight this performance as well
you can find we benchmarking datum in the appendix of this earnings slide presentation and on Dow 's investor website
another point of distinction come from the market segment that we have be target and the consumer orientation that we have in we product and solution which I will cover on Slide
with we primary market vertical of packaging infrastructure and consumer care we business portfolio be tilted towards the consumer
and in today 's situation we find that a substantial part of we business be essential to some of the most critical end market that consumer value
relate to the pandemic Dow have a breadth of solution that be in high demand
we see a strong pull in application such as intermediate for cleaning product pharmaceutical ingredient packaging and nonwoven for gown wipe and mask and food packaging to secure the freshness and safety of we food supply
these be moment when we material science expertise and technology prove they worth and play a significant role
for example in the pharmaceutical and health and hygiene market alone the follow be example of just some of the product enable by material science innovation and we diverse set of chemistry silicone technology that enable disposable glove and tissue detergent and hard surface cleaner soap and shampoo plastic that be vital for syringe medical tube vial hose valve device and pharma packaging drape glove and gown polyurethane solution use for hospital bedding rigid insulation for medicine refrigeration and transport and safety issue coating application for medical device and tape potable water pipe paper food packaging and paper cup and we Industrial Solutions team recently find a innovative way to reconfigure exist underutilize asset to increase we volume of isopropyl alcohol by up to 50_%
this be a critical raw material for hand sanitizer
out of period of change new way of living work and stay healthy be develop across the diverse market that we serve such as improve the performance comfort and convenience of PPE smart building and infrastructure solution for multipurpose space restaurant takeout food packaging home and surface care solution and antimicrobial
Dow 's material science know-how and strong design collaboration with customer can help enable new solution to these develop market need
on slide the last point of distinction I want to highlight be the global scale of we operation
this be something we often take for grant but the_year so far have emphasize just how much of a advantage it provide to we ability to meet customer demand rapidly adjust and innovate and take advantage of with well-developed agile regional supply_chain and a deep understanding of the need of we customer in all of we market
we geographic diversity serve as a natural hedge for we business operation and uniquely position we to shine in time of crisis and uncertainty
in fact all of these strength be on display in the_first_quarter as we team rapidly work through regional and global supply chain complexity manufacture limitation and shift consumer trend
and as we move through the rest of the_year I see these strength continue to provide Dow with unique advantage
altogether Dow 's point of distinction unmatched feedstock flexibility a superior product mix participation in critical end market and geographic diversity set we apart and give we a competitive edge today and throughout the cycle
in summary Dow be prepare for what be ahead
we balance_sheet be strong and we have plenty of liquidity to meet we obligation with no significant long-term debt due over the next few year
we continue to take proactive and thoughtful action both operationally and financially with a focus on safety and cash_flow which we firmly believe will serve we well through this period
we have unique point of distinction that differentiate Dow and position we for upside when the economic recovery begin
we have a remarkable team who continue to inspire and deliver every day and we be focus on navigate through this challenging time emerge even stronger and continue to execute we growth playbook
with that I will turn it back to Colleen to open the Q&A
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and we will take we first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley
maybe I could just ask about how you be think about in packaging Specialty Plastics
if you look at the price decline that you guide to for 2q could you just talk about how much of that be come out of do you think it be go to come out of the U.S. market versus it be just the weak export market or the EU
and how be you think about ethane and propane through the_quarter
there be be some volatility in ethane over the last month and propane seem to be pretty be pretty stubborn relative to the move in crude so far
Vince everybody be do great here and thanks for ask
we hope you be too
most of the pricing and I think what you be say on pricing be that you be see thing kind of come to a global kind of a price right_now and that you would expect that with what be happen
I think you be go to see a little bit more come out in Europe than in North_America
a little bit less in Latin America a little bit less in the Pacific
actually we have start to see export to China step up pretty dramatically
China have reduce the tariff come in
and the chinese economy be start to rebind versus March
I would say we start to see activity there in late March and through the month of April so the industrial part of the economy be start to get roll again
Consumer part still a little bit uneven
and then obviously we do what we do on supply just to balance off demand
so we have a good strong first quarter
volume be flat slightly up in packaging Specialty Plastics but we be go to see some impact on volume in the industrial part of the sector in the_second_quarter which be why we tighten up some of the supply
and that be primarily due to industrial shipping industrial application automotive application
we be start to see the automotive industry talk about come back here in the month of May and also in the month of May in Europe
so hopefully we will see the May June turn in the economy on the industrial side here in North_America Latin America
and next we will move to John Roberts with UBS
can you comment on other industry closure you might be see
we do not usually think of Dow as high cost although ethane have kind of slip here currently
but be we see other closure we have not hear about yet from competitor in the marketplace
yes John thanks for the question
we be not close high-cost asset
we be close to balance demand
so look all of these be reasonable cost asset but the reality be there be be a pretty significant amount of industrial capacity shutdown on the downstream
and so we do not feel like in this environment really plow a lot of material into inventory be the right thing to do
so that be why we be dial back the capacity
I have see some delay and indefinite suspension of project
there be one this week in Ohio the Thai project that be go to go ahead
so we be start to see some of those kind of announcement
we be see reduce rate across polyurethane across the globe basically and we have get polyurethane
mdi capacity down in China right_now not we but competitor do really to balance out the fact that downstream automotive and appliance and construction for insulation material have be slow
so I think that be what you be see
I think it have less to do with the cost position and more to do with supply demand
and David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have we next question
on the same point the idle of the Americas ethylene polyethylene plant be you decision be influence at all by the cost competitiveness of these plant give the recent drop in oil price
and if not be you concern about lose any share to competitor who be not be as discipline as you be
CEO Chairman across we plastic business
and ethylene cost be still very low in the U.S. Gulf Coast so we have not idle anything on the ethylene side
in fact right_now probably 9 % to 10_% of ethylene production capacity be out on the U.S. Gulf Coast
so we will balance that out
we have be operate very well from a working capital standpoint
and I think what we be try to do here be just make sure that we do not plow a lot of material into inventory until we see a good demand signal come on the back end
we be start to get good sign
we be start to get positive sign out of many state in the United_States for a May opening and some part of Europe like Germany Austria Switzerland
and then I think as confidence build testing come along people be go to be more certain about go back into manufacturing and consumer will be back in the market
and at that point it be easy to fire these polyethylene unit back up and meet that demand
and next we will move to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein
a follow-up on the previous question there
the 5 % to 10 % lower ethylene that seem to be higher than the industry average
how much of that be refill you own inventory from tx-9
and maybe a sort of a hypothetical if tx-9 have not be down do you think you would have be force to reduce rate more in line with industry average
yes
thanks Jonas for the question
texas-9 be back up so it be at the $ 2 million run rate right_now
most of that expansion on texas-9 be for MEGlobal for they consumption for MEG
and so they have be buy ethylene in the market to really get themselves start up and run so this supply they in the marketplace
and I have not see any reduction in volume there
I think the other thing that be happen be as you have see the automotive industry go down people that be crack naphtha or crack heavier do not have much place for some of the aromatic and some of the off-grade to go
and so the rubber industry have be slow
Automotive industry have be slow
so that have bring rate down in some other cracker and then you have have some more turnaround and outage in other cracker
so as we go into the_quarter we feel like the toughest quarter here be go to be q2
and so we want to make sure that we balance supply and demand through q2 and position ourselves to be able to turn thing back on and come up as the industry start to come back
and we will move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan
what be you cash tax rate
be it between 30 % and 35 %
or be it lower or higher
and in the United_States how will you feedstock slate in produce ethylene change versus
in what be you rough percentage of ethane propane and naphtha
and what do you think they will be this_year
let I get Howard to cover the tax rate while I have to do some CEO math on you crack question
all right
I will wait for you to do CEO math
hey Jeff so look the tax rate the P&L tax rate that we publish this_morning for q2 and for the full year be between 30 % and 35 % slightly higher than what we have guide to earlier and really issue lower equity earnings different yield mix of earnings and then some discrete item
but I would say on you question on cash tax it be lower than that rate
I would guide you to something in the mid-20
and to you question on crack Jeff and I will just focus on U.S. Gulf Coast here because that be where the bulk of the flexibility be
yes I would say we be in the 75 % 80 % ethane crack through the_year
the balance would be propane and butane and very little talk for the back half of the_year
it be on naphtha
naphtha have come down but honestly ethane be still the best crack
and so if ethane get tight and we start to see price rise and propane come into the slate we will swing over to we propane flex
and as you know we can swing 70 % of the capacity over to propane
so we have get that flexibility build into what we be modeling
and I be optimistic that this be a more resilient gas market than people be estimate
and we will move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global
just want to sort of continue with this theme of the feedstock side of thing
let 's just assume for a second that the feedstock environment that we be in right_now be the new normal in term of roughly where crude oil pricing be this assertion that in this lower crude oil pricing environment obviously you will see curtailment and cut on the shale side of thing
maybe ethane be not as advantaged as it use to be
so now sort of beyond the extreme near term if that be the feedstock cost environment how do you see the second wave of cracker and derivative sort of unit play_out
I mean in theory the cto/mto side will not look that competitive maybe naphtha look a bit more competitive
certainly whoever have flexibility will be better off than those that do not
and then you have this whole sort of notion of a lot of capacity in theory come online eventually in China
a lot of the facility here in the U.S. just be pure ethane-based facility
I mean how do you see those all of those sort of different factor play_out if feedstock continue to act the way they have over the last couple of month
thanks Hassan
that be a lot in that question
but I would say right_now if thing continue where they be today we would say there be about 21 million metric ton about 11 % of c2 capacity that be at risk
that be either due to age or the scale or the high conversion cost or they feedstock crack capability
I think one of the assumption that everybody make with naphtha come down be that the whole world be go to switch to naphtha crack
but what people forget be that you make so many byproduct on naphtha and there be no home for those byproduct
so those byproduct credit go away
at the end of the day ethane and propane still remain the most competitive crack and we think that be go to continue
the other assumption that go into this then be what happen to oil price and oil have respond to just a unbelievable slowdown in demand which be primarily because we tell everybody to stay at home and nobody be travel
but what we be see in China be people be go back
traffic rate in China for car traffic and truck traffic be back up to 80 % of what they be pre-covid
and I think when people come back here they be go to come back into they car
that be go to tighten up the demand side or the demand side on oil
at the same time some of these supply adjustment be go to come back in
so I be not predict that we be go to go to this be the oil demand for the rest of the_future
I think if you look over a long long time that oil demand growth track population and what be go_on around the world with the development of the economy
we will get back to that
the question for everybody be just what be the time frame
be people go to if we get a test and we get a treatment be people go to get optimistic and go back faster
or be this go to take longer than people think
and Hassan on you cto/mto question I would say about $ 6.5 million of that $ 21 million be cto/mto which with oil below $ 50 that be those be really stressed asset
and we will move on to PJ Juvekar with Citi
just a quick question again on these co-product
you mention that there be no demand for co-product and price be come down
how would that change naphtha margin
and then can you compare current today 's ethylene margin in U.S. versus Europe
you be in a good position to do that
and any thought on new China ethylene cracker that be come online
I think what we have see so far PJ in term of the cost curve on ethylene be that naphtha have come down but lighter crack ethane propane crack be still advantage to $ 100 or maybe more than $ 100 a ton
and so that be a byproduct of the byproduct credit
and when you run these naphtha cracker typically market and net that back against the ethylene capacity
when there be no margin on the byproduct there be no netback credit
and so that be what we be look at be there be no place for the c4 to go the butadiene demand be down rubber demand be down
and so at some point you flip those market upside down
and at that point people just slow down rather than crack more naphtha
so that be what we be look at and I think that be what we be go to see play_out
and we will move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets
on the cost side can you speak to the $ 350 million cost asset that you be look to pull out
how quickly that can be phase in
and then I guess also in term of the cost and efficiency improvement that you be look for in Sadara how can we be think about that play through throughout the_year as well and if that may be expedite in any way
yes
let 's Howard can put a good time frame to that
yes
yes John on the $ 350 million I would say I would look at about 20_% of that realize in the_second_quarter
and then the 80 % pretty evenly split between the_third_quarter and fourth quarter maybe a little bit of a lighter third quarter and a heavier fourth quarter just as we continue to take those cost out
relative to Sadara look if these naphtha margin hold you will actually see a margin expansion in Sadara as the_second_quarter progress
and then on the cost out the team continue to do a good job of reduce cost pretty evenly through the_year
in fact if you look at we equity earnings in the_first_quarter it be the one jv that actually be flat or up on same quarter last year or prior quarter basis and that be really because they see the same thing that all of the other JVs see which be some margin compression because of the demand disruption but they be able to offset that with the cost
the other thing that they be also work on be just the sell up
remember we bring unit operation on pretty much in about a 12-month period
so we sell they out but now we have get to sell they up
and so the team be work on that
that be not go to be a or 2-quarter activity but that be over the course of about or 4 year
and we will move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research
and Jim I would like to echo you appreciation and congrat to Neal and offer a warm welcome to Colleen
so Dow have speak in the_past about multiple Monte Carlo simulation and I be not sure if you factored in a pandemic or oil collapse in those simulation
but here we be if I be look at the first half of 2020 we be run at a run rate below $ 6 billion in EBITDA
so I guess my question be at what level decline in profitability do you start to get concern about the dividend
and if you could offer any comment regard that that would be very helpful
sure
let I have Howard do that because he go through a tremendous amount of this work pre-spin as we come out of spin
Howard
yes Frank
look we be really smart
I do not know that we factored in a pandemic into the Monte Carlo simulation
so let I use the current most bearish Wall Street number that be out there on we earnings around $ 5.1 billion $ 5.2 billion of ebitda
if you take out interest and tax that leave you with about $ 4 billion
and then from there you have get a $ 2.1 billion dividend
you have get what we say today be $ 1.25 billion of capex and $ 500 million of Sadara
so you have get plenty of room even at that bearish number to do it just with operating earnings and more than cover the dividend
we be also work on the nonoperate side of the house
so part of we cash_flow in the_first_quarter be the $ 250 million that we get from the Nova judgment on the tax side
obviously if earnings be that kind of depressed and oil be down we be go to see at least a $ 500 million release in cash on work capital
and then we have get some of the other nonoperate thing that we be work on which be the Olin payment that be expect and contractually obligate at the end of the year of about $ 500 million
so even at that level we be more than comfortable and adequately able to cover that dividend
and we have get $ 12 billion of committed liquidity include $ 3.6 billion of cash on hand
and we will move on to Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse
can you just walk we through you various Sadara assumption just regard the structural op improvement you reference and just also update we on you debt re-profiling discussion
sure
Howard do you want to hit Sadara all of we assumption and we debt re-profiling
yes
so look I mean what we say in the prepared remark this_morning we be very pleased that Sadara get that last remain rail agreement logistics agreement sign
that be the final substantive step to achieve pcd
now we have a series of what I would call administrative step that Sadara have get to work through thing like registration of they security document for the lender verification of the project cost and some of those other thing
those should be well underway as we approach the end of the second quarter if not completely do
as a result of the logistics agreement be do the Sadara Saudi Aramco and Dow treasury team have jointly begin the lender re-profiling discussion
in fact those discussion get actively start this week
I would say for modeling purpose it be go to take the balance of the_year to make that happen
you have get eca in the mix you have get sukuk financing and you have get international bank
so it be go to be a complicated discussion
that be why we say look $ 500 million of cash this_year in line with last_year make sense from a modeling purpose standpoint
but we be pretty focus on make sure that we get that do by the end of the year
that be the goal
and if you see Chris Sadara 's first quarter result be relatively flat with last_year
we be take lot of action Sadara and Aramco and Dow to make sure that they can continue to deliver performance similar to last_year
and we put in the model $ 500 million which be we contribution to repayment of principal for the_year
so that be how much cash we will be look at put in this_year
and we will move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America
I want to drill in a little more on the $ 350 million of cost cut
can you describe what functional area and business these come from
and perhaps you can talk a little bit about the learning from you benchmarking analysis
any specific productivity initiative that have come out of that
yes Steve
so let I try to hit it and then ask Howard if I miss anything to come in
so it be not I think most people will go to this and say that it be headcount-related
we have try not to do that
obviously we have get almost all of we plant run today
so we be try to support we customer
we be idle some capacity but we be not lay off people in order to do that
we have cut discretionary spend
and then obviously big bucket of spend like travel and other thing be near
and so there be be a shift in some of the spending
we have move out some turnaround activity
that carry with it obviously some discretionary expense that go along
and so we have look at different type of activity like that where we can cut discretionary spend out and we have get that model out for the rest of the_year
but we have not give that this be a pandemic and one of the biggest challenge around the world have be the number of people that be unemployed we have not try to add to that because that be a burden right_now for a lot of government around the world
we have also do a fair amount of digitalization as we bring the DuPont asset in and set up for regional back-office center one in China one in the Netherlands one in the U.S. here in Michigan and then another in São Paulo
so we have be able to do a lot of streamline as well
and next we will move to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets
I guess I just want to ask about both polyethylene and polyurethane
both market have go through some structural change here polyethylene on the feedstock side and potentially demand side polyurethane on the demand side with maybe reduce demand for consumer discretionary item
I guess would you agree with those characterization
and I guess when you think about that think longer term do you foresee any change in you strategy
in polyurethane you have talk about add system house and pe you talk about sell up
be those still valid in this environment
have you see new customer trade down or change they strategy as well
Arun I think we will get back to the growth playbook as we mention in the script
and I think it be just a matter of timing here
so it do not make sense right_now to continue to plow cash and the capacity when the demand in Europe and North_America and Latin America have slow down because people be stay at home
so that be why we be take some of the action that we be take right_now it be just to balance that demand
but that demand will come back
people be not go to stay at home forever
we be help government right_now with safe way to return to work
and we be operate safely Dow people go to the site every day and we be operate safely and people be healthy
so we know it can be do but it be just go to take some time before the consumer confidence to come back
and that be why we be do what we be do
downstream expansion in we Industrial Solutions and in we functional silicone product be still continue
Systems house will come back as the automotive business and the installation and construction business come back and we will continue to look at downstream on plastic
and that will conclude today 's question-and-answer session
at this time I would like to turn the call back over to Colleen Kay for any additional or close remark
thank you everyone for join we call today
we appreciate you interest in Dow
for you reference a copy of we transcript will be post on Dow 's website within 24 hour
this conclude we call and have a safe day
and that will conclude today 's call
we thank you for you participation
you may now disconnect

Ms. McDonnell
thank you and good morning
earlier today we announce first quarter revenue of $ 8.7 million which be a increase of 2.8 % over the first quarter last year
we also report GAAP net income of $ 0.14 per diluted share and non-gaap net income of $ 0.18 per diluted share
these result be negatively impact by the covid-19_pandemic and similar to the current discussion be have across much of the of
regard we ability to sell we product in the current environment much of the sale cycle for product recognize in revenue during the_first_quarter be complete in the fourth quarter 2019
additionally as we progress through the first quarter 2020 and the impact of covid-19 continue to spread throughout the world we experience a acceleration in the decline of order for we product as we customer focus they effort on prepare for and treat those infect with the virus and defer decision to purchase we product into the_future
also during this time many of we hospital customer begin restrict access to health care worker only diminish we ability to generate sale which may delay the timing of future order
we may be further impact if hospital choose to maintain they restriction on hospital entrant and limit they capital spending plan until they operation have stabilize
so despite the significant uncertainty create by covid-19 we believe that this be a shorter-term dynamic and that higher demand for we product will return
during the_quarter there be several bright spot for we to focus on
the first be revenue from we international channel exceed we initial forecast and total international revenue grow almost 73 % over the first quarter last year
second we receive covid-related order for we iv pump for some customer because of its remote control capability and its use as the primary infusing device in a isolation room configuration
we be really proud to be able to contribute to the overall treatment effort for this virus
and third revenue from sale of we iv set also exceed we initial forecast in part due to covid-related demand
during the_quarter we learn that some customer be use one version of we iv tubing set to infuse patient locate in a isolation room utilize a pump that be position outside that room
with the current shortage of critical care supplies iradimed want to do more to help health care provider combat the increase demand that COVID-19 have place on they
so we be use we clean room and iv set manufacture expertise to build standard extension tubing that can be substitute for any iv extension tubing we customer be have trouble finding
it be just a simple iv tube use the same quality material and component we use in we regular tubing
and we expect sale of this new tubing to begin within the next few day
during q1 we fill key leadership role in sale regulatory affair and quality assurance and r&d as part of succession planning and to continue build out we capability that will help support the growth we anticipate in the_year ahead
we also continue make progress on we product road map and have not see any significant change to time line at this point
however I will point out that there be step in the new product testing phase that require the use of third party
and give the stay-at-home restriction implement by many government authority there may be shift to we original testing schedule
now from a supply chain standpoint we be not experience any delay in obtain the material for we product at this time
overall we be experience significant change to we business due to COVID
during this time we be focus on the thing that we can control and continue to make investment in the company that be supportive of its longer-term health with the goal of emerge from the pandemic even stronger
in we effort to manage through this environment we be look through lens
the first one be product innovation for future growth
as mention we have recently fill key technical leadership role and continue to make progress on we product road map
the second one be serve we customer whether through modify a version of we iv tubing to facilitate infusion from outside a isolation room or supply we iv pump for its remote control capability or provide virtual product training
we stand ready to support we customer delivery of critical care for covid-19 patient
the third lens be take care of we employee
we have a highly train workforce and have implement several policy that support they health and well-being during this time
these range from enhance cleaning procedure at we headquarters facility to remote work arrangement where feasible
the fourth be cost containment
we have already take several step to contain cost include implement reduce hour in some department and comply with travel and entry restriction by we field sale and clinical support team
we will continue to look through these lens as the situation develop and we will evaluate take additional step if need
now I will turn it over to Chris to summarize the financial result
thank you and good morning
as always I will be discuss we financial result on a GAAP basis as well as on a non-gaap basis
we non-gaap operating result exclude stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effect
infrequent tax item be consider base on they nature and exclude from we provision for income tax as these item be not indicative of we normal provision for income tax
Free cash flow be cash_flow from operation less cash use for purchase of property and equipment
we believe the presentation of these non-gaap measure along with we gaap financial statement can be helpful in provide a more thorough analysis of we ongoing financial performance
you can find a reconciliation of these non-gaap measure to the nearest gaap measure on the last page of today 's press_release
as we report this_morning , first quarter 2020 revenue increase 2.8 % over the first quarter last year
revenue from domestic sale decrease 10.6 % to $ 6.3 million during the current quarter while revenue from international sale increase 72.7 % to $ 2.4 million for the current quarter
the decrease in domestic sale be primarily drive by lower pump sale and the increase in international sale be drive by higher pump and monitor sale
revenue from sale of we device decrease 6.8 % to $ 5.6 million for the first quarter 2020
this decrease be drive by a 36.4 % decline in iv pump revenue that be partially offset by a 63.5 % increase in revenue from we monitoring system
the average selling price of we mri-compatible iv infusion pump system during the first quarter of 2020 be approximately $ 29,900 compare to approximately $ 35,800 for the same period in
the decrease in asp relate to higher international sale of we infusion pump recognize in revenue when compare to the first quarter last year
the average selling price of we mri-compatible patient vital sign monitor system during the first quarter 2020 be approximately $ 35,400 compare to approximately $ 37,400 for the same period in
the decrease in asp relate to higher international sale of we monitoring system recognize in revenue when compare to the first quarter last year
revenue from sale of we disposable service and other increase by 30.7 % to $ 2.7 million for the first quarter 2020 from $ 2 million for the same quarter in 2019
and lastly revenue from the amortization of extended maintenance contract increase 4.5 % to $ 0.5 million for the current quarter
Gross margin be 74.5 % for the 2020 quarter and 75.7 % for the 2019 quarter
the decrease in gross margin be a result of higher international sale as a percent of total revenue partially offset by unfavorable inventory cost adjustment recognize during the first quarter last year
operating_expense be $ 5.7 million or 66 % of revenue compare to $ 4.9 million or 57.8 % of revenue for the first quarter last year
on a dollar basis operating_expense increase due to higher expense for payroll benefit and stock compensation due to higher headcount higher employee recruiting cost and higher legal and professional fee partially offset by lower sale commission
we effective tax rate for the 2020 quarter be negative 111.7 % compare to negative 14.9 % for the 2019 quarter
the lower effective tax rate be primarily due to discrete item relate to stock compensation we to carry back we net operating loss to year prior to the enactment of the tax cut and Jobs Act which increase the benefit to the previously enact federal tax rate of 35 % versus the current federal tax rate of 21 %
net income on a GAAP basis be $ 0.14 per diluted share for the first quarter 2020 compare to $ 0.15 for the 2019 quarter
on a non-gaap basis net income be $ 0.18 per diluted share for the current quarter compare to $ 0.13 for the first quarter last year
from a cash flow perspective we generate $ 1.2 million of cash from operation compare to $ 700,000 for the 2019 quarter
for the 3 month end March 31 , 2020 cash provide by operation be provide be positively impact by cash inflow from account receivable and deferred revenue and negatively impact by prepaid income tax inventory and accrue payroll and benefit
for the 3 month end March 31 , 2020 and 2019 we free cash_flow a non-gaap measure be $ 1 million and $ 600,000 respectively
and lastly we exit the_quarter with a combined cash and investment balance of $ 47.4 million and no third-party debt or other restrictive covenant
and with that I will turn the call over for question
operator
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- you first question be from Scott Henry with Roth Capital
a couple of question
I guess first just a big picture question
I recognize you do not want to give guidance but can you talk qualitatively about how we should think about 2q relative to 1q give covid-19
well Scott this be Leslie
I will maybe start off by provide a little of that qualitative context for the kind of short to medium term and then Chris can add to my comment
when we think about how have that return to growth what be it go to look like the time frame which just happen be go to be uncertain
but when we think about we portfolio it really be well position with its remote capability MRI safety and transportability
we have a nice mix of equipment and critical care disposable
we be geographically diversify so in different country around the world recover from this pandemic at different rate
we will see benefit from that and be able to participate in that
and probably finally we believe the need to do mri on critical patient and those need sedation will absolutely continue
in fact there be accumulate evidence suggest that patient with severe covid-19 may be at risk for encephalopathy which be actually cause a increase in critical care patient need MRI exam
so these be just a few thought to kind of put some qualitative context around that path back to higher growth
and I guess just to kind of follow up and I know you do not want to get too granular but I mean be it reasonable to think of business be down 40 % to 50_% in 2q
just try to get a sense of the magnitude
and along that line could you give I a sense of how you business typically perform
and if there be a recessionary environment I would think it would be relatively defensive but curious of you take
so Scott I mean I think you be hit on a lot of the uncertainty that really cause we to withdraw we financial guidance in the beginning
and to Leslie 's point the duration that be impact or the duration of the pandemic itself when be the country go to reopen how be that go to look when be other country go to reopen and how do that play_out I think there be a lot of the uncertainty exist around and try to quantify that be quite challenging at this point
could to you question could revenue be down 50_%
I be assume you be talk about 50_% from the_first_quarter
that would put we somewhere around I do not know call it $ 4.3 million $ 4.4 million
and I mean my sense be that be a pretty drastic move but certainly not out of the realm of possibility
but it be challenging try to answer you question specifically
okay
no Chris that be actually really helpful
I appreciate just kind of the context behind that
and then I just want to ask in first quarter the monitor sale be very strong relative to expectation
I mean they be strong in q4
typically q1 maybe we drop back down but it be a really solid number particularly give the background
but then pump get hit a little more which not totally unexpected
but can you talk a little bit about those trend between the strong monitor sale and a little more weakness in the pump sale in q1
I think part of this go back to just we international channel perform very well with both pump and monitor
domestically we struggle a little bit more on the pump side than I would say when compare to compare to the international side
but I think part of this go to how the hospital restriction be roll out
the March or I would say the third month in every quarter be always the most important month for we when it come to booking
and for really we start to see restriction on we ability to access hospital in mid to late February where those rumor be start to float around and isolate instance of hospital really shut they door to vendor
and then of course as we progress throughout the month of March that really become the norm
and it impact we ability domestically
so I can not there be not anything out of the ordinary related to pump but other than the impact from COVID and hard to put a finger on anything else other than COVID
okay
Great
and just a final question just can you just clarify
it look like the tax gain in be not exclude from non-gaap ep
be that correct
that be right
it be not mean it be not pull out
it be not pull out
that be right
the next question be from Lisa Springer with singular research
during you remark you mention that covid-related order for iv set
I be wonder if you could do you have a sense of how much of the increase in disposable be relate to covid-19 type demand
so Lisa this be Leslie McDonnell
we be not we do not have a good enough sense of that to be able to break that out
we see the biggest surge in the iv set business in what we call we extension type set
now those be typically use in critical care environment
so I think there be definitely a positive impact from customer buy ahead as well as see a opportunity to use that tubing for patient who be in isolation room setting and they want to control the pump from outside that room
okay
and you also do in you remark you mention cost containment be one of you the leg of the company go into
could you give we a little more detail around what area you might be look at
and have you set specific goal for cost containment
well I think at this point we be look at a lot of thing
we have take some step already regard reduce hour where possible restrict travel thing like that
we be sort of play-booking a lot of different option
but at this point it be too early to carry out any of those plan so soon
okay
and do you have any sense in term of the mix between domestic versus international go into the_second_quarter
be it go to be stronger internationally again
or do you have a sense of that
I mean Lisa I think that really will depend on how fast the U.S. hospital open up to manufacture partner come in in support they
it be we be see into that report of that in different place in the United_States
it be kind of hard to gauge that relative to the pace of recovery in other country
I think we international business will continue to stay strong
the comment I make before about that geographically diversified revenue base I think it be go to play in we favor because of all that uncertainty
at this time there be no further question
I will hand the call over to Ms. McDonnell
I would like to thank everyone for listen and participate in the call
these be unpredictable time and we be take step that come out of this pandemic stronger than ever
to manage through this we be focus on the thing in we control and be vigilant in the area of product innovation serve we customer take care of we employee and assess the impact of covid on we cost structure
wish you all continue good health and we look forward to speak with you again after q2
thank you
this conclude the call
you may now disconnect

while management believe that its assumption expectation and projection be reasonable in view of currently available information you be caution not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statement

at this time it be my pleasure to turn the call over to Lisa Conte Jaguar Health 's President and Chief_Executive_Officer
Lisa the floor be yours
thank you thank you very much
we thank you all who be on the phone very much for join we call today
my name be Lisa Conte
I be the founder and ceo of Jaguar Health and we wholly own subsidiary Napo Pharmaceuticals
I may use the name Napo and Jaguar interchangeably throughout this call
first I of course want to send my warmest wish to everyone as we all navigate through these unprecedented time
we feel grateful to report that everyone at Jaguar and Napo be fine
we be all stick at home do this call remotely
and as such we will not be take Q&A today
of company have be together for over 10 to 25 year of we have be work together for over 30 year
that trust familiarity and continuity allow we to work well together even when work remotely
now we literally finish each other during sentence
thirty year ago we be in the middle of another pandemic hiv/aids
and for Napo we be on a mission to find naturally source plant-based medicine to meet urgent global health need
we successfully bring mytesi from a tree that we would possibly harvest from the Amazon rainforest to the first and only oral plant-based prescription medicine approve under botanical guidance by the FDA
today we find ourselves in the middle of the covid-19_pandemic work with the FDA to determine if
mytesi may be appropriate for emergency use authorization for symptomatic relief of diarrhea in patient with covid-19
nearly 38 million people with hiv globally and nearly 25 million people use antiretroviral therapy base on datum from UNAIDS at the end of June 2019
as a reminder mytesi be a first-in-class antisecretory agent currently fda-approved for the indication of symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patient with hiv/aids on antiretroviral therapy
we have a essential product with mytesi we be in essential business and we would anticipate stock up and take step to ensure that patient live with hiv who rely on mytesi have uninterrupted access to this first of its kind oral plant-based prescription medicine
Mytesi as we say before be a product in the pipeline
we be actively develop multiple potential follow on pipeline indication focus on gi indication the most advanced be cancer therapy-related diarrhea which we refer to as ctd
other potential gi indication include irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease and crohn 's supportive care functional diarrhea and pediatric rare gastrointestinal disease indication
there be primary topic we will be cover for today 's call with participate speaker from the company the same speaker
I will begin with a status update regard we ongoing business development effort and provide a update on covid-19-related activity
next I will turn the discussion over to we senior vp of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer Carol Lizak who will recap financial for and provide a comparison to
after Carol we will introduce Ian Wendt we Vice President of Commercial Strategy
Ian will discuss the multiple facet of Napo 's enhance market access strategy for mytesi for the currently approve indication of hiv related diarrhea which be a initiative we be quite excited about and occur real time
Dr. Steven King we Chief of Ethnobotanical Science and also the project leader of we cholera development program will provide information regard recently approve funding support from the National Institute of Allergy and infectious disease in support of the cholera program move forward
Steve will also discuss the role that traditional medicine have play and potentially be currently play in the fight against global pathogen scourge
and finally Dr. Pravin Chaturvedi we Scientific Officer will speak to the regulatory development relate to crofelemer for the potential CTD indication and potential pediatric rare disease indication for congenital diarrheal disorder and short bowel syndrome
let 's jump right in
look forward we believe have the potential to be a transformative year for Jaguar and Napo
we core goal for include initiate the pivotal trial in the second half of this year for mytesi for CTD cancer therapy-related diarrhea and complete the rollout of we enhance market especially during this time of global crisis
the majority of people live with hiv/aids in the United_States be older
as Tez Anderson the founder of the nonprofit organization let 's kick ass AIDS Survivor syndrome point out to I recently it be not we first pandemic Lisa
the community be resilient as be Napo and we believe we enhance patient access plan will help expand mytesi access among hiv patient which you will hear more about from Ian
key to we business model this sustainable-based commercial business effort support the company 's strategy to become a stable cash flow positive business support primarily by growth in mytesi sale
simultaneously and as I state before we be confident that by mid-2020 we will forge a regional ex U.S. business development deal possibly more than to bring in nondilutive dollar to support the pivotal trial initiation and/or key clinical development activity for pipeline follow-on indication for mytesi
we mantra at Napo be pipeline pipeline pipeline drive by business development business development business development for that pipeline mobilization
we have a remarkable risk-mitigated product pipeline a pipeline within a product I can not say that enough which contain multiple novel and important follow-on indication for mytesi
let I remind you it be a drug product that be already approve by the FDA for chronic indication and therefore support by chronic safety package gmp commercial manufacturing be in place for mytesi and several of the follow-on indication for mytesus be back by strong phase ii and/or proof-of-concept datum
the depth of we pipeline provide potential supportive care solution for a large patient population across multiple disease indication around the globe
and we believe this pipeline will fuel long-term value creation for investor and provide nondiluted funding opportunity for partner collaboration around the world
Diarrhea related to cancer therapy continue to be the core focus of we pipeline development effort
a significant portion of patient undergo cancer treatment experience diarrhea
novel target cancer therapy agent such as epidermal growth factor receptor antibody Herceptin for example and tyrosine kinase inhibitor Herceptin for I be sorry anyways tyrosine kinase inhibitor with or without standard chemotherapy agent may activate natural chloride secretion pathway in the gastrointestinal mucosa potentially lead to secretory diarrhea
accord to datum appear in treatment guideline for cid which stand for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea a component of CTD and this be in the April 2004 issue of Gastroenterology & Endoscopy News diarrhea be the most common adverse event report in chemotherapy patient
Diarrhea in this patient population have a potential to cause dehydration
OTC antimotility agent such as the opioid imodium or loperamide cause constipation and lethargy
and many cancer patient with diarrhea require drug holiday or dose reduction in they life-saving cancer therapy
better management of diarrhea allow for better potentially allow for better compliance with the therapeutic dosing of target treatment for cancer
and as we have show in relevant animal model potentially lead to better clinical outcome for cancer patient and in particular for cancer patient on long-term adjuvant therapy
to continue I want to mention we effort to make mytesi available for supportive care related to covid-19
we submit a emergency release authorization request on March 21 , 2020
the request be base on and accompany by a letter of endorsement submit to Dr. Janet Woodcock Director of the FDA 's Center for Drug evaluation and research and cc to FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn from a world leader in the field of infectious disease and epidemiology
the letter of endorsement be base on information and publication with key opinion leader have be review real time which indicate that there be adequate information to document that diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptom be early symptom of covid-19 prior to the pulmonary symptom
he review of datum also support the tenet that the virus can be shed from the dress and be thus potentially transmissible via the fecal-oral route
decrease fecal volume by change the stool consistency from watery to form stool be key to the mechanism of action and the result of mytesi would not only support patient 's care but could thus also reduce the contagion risk to health care provider
as we have hear from the FDA they expect to get back to we in day with respect to this potential off-label use of mytesi
we be so pleased to have the FDA 's attention for a request to provide possible support to covid-19 patient and potentially reduce contagion among patient and health care worker
and we be grateful to and proud of the many Napo stakeholder that have take the initiative and perseverance in the time to chaos to play a meaningful role in seek to address the weak during this pandemic
back to we major core business
we will now move along to the financial result
the company file its 10-k on Friday , April 3 with the SEC
the 10-k can of course be view on the SEC 's website and on the Investor Relations section of the Jaguar website
I will now turn the call over to Carol Lizak Jaguar 's senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer to review top line financial result for the_year end December 31 , 2019
Carol
thank you Lisa and thank you all for join we call today
key financial highlight for the_year end December 31 , 2019 be as follow Mytesi net sale be approximately $ 5.7 million a increase of 36 % in year-over-year
the mytesi total prescription volume increase to 62 % in the year 2019 over the year 2018
the total operating_expense for the year 2019 be $ 34.7 million as compare to $ 35.2 million for the year 2018 a 1 % or $ 500,000 decrease year over-year
the decrease in total operating_expense be primarily due to the write-off of goodwill of $ 5.2 million in the year 2018 offset by a impairment of long-lived intangible asset of $ 4 million and $ 600,000 in the settlement of the royalty license agreement
that conclude my recap of high-level financial for
I will now hand the discussion over to we next speaker Ian Wendt
good morning all
as Lisa state in she opening comment and as the company announce last week Napo be expand NapoCares we patient support program for mytesi the company 's fda-approved plant-based prescription drug indicate for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patient live with hiv on any retroviral therapy
the change to the NapoCares program be intend to increase mytesi patient access uptake and persistency
hiv enteropathy which be chronic diarrhea due to the direct or indirect effect of hiv on the gi tract be a problem for many hiv positive patient
unlike certain antidiarrheal product that be only approve for acute use mytesi be a nonopioid derivative and have a very low-risk of cause constipation
mytesi be approve for chronic use and its unique mechanism of action help ensure that diarrhea do not have to become the new normal for adult patient live with hiv on any retroviral therapy
we field team 's effort remain focused primarily on physician who be already write mytesi prescription on alleviate access issue face by patient and on increase the duration of mytesi therapy in hiv patient be clinically appropriate while also reduce mytesi-related cost burden in non government support payer channel
the expansion to the NapoCares program raise income limit on patient eligible for Napo 's uninsured free drug program significantly increase co-pay support for commercially insure patient and allow the co-pay amount to remain the same whether a patient fill a 30-day or 90-day prescription of mytesi
these change become effective on April 1
a key component of the NapoCares market access program involve offering significantly expand support for eligible patient to reduce out-of-pocket cost as a barrier to obtain mytesi in the U.S.
the income limit for the patient assistance program which offer free drug for uninsured patient have increase from 2x the federal poverty limit to 5x the federal poverty limit a 150 % increase and the
mytesi co-pay benefit for commercially insure patient have be increase from a annual maximum of $ 1,200 to $ 6,000 which be a 400 % increase
most eligible patient will now pay no more than $ 25 for they mytesi prescription
additionally patient can now use they co-pay card if they refill Mytesi prescription earlier and every 30 day
fast-start prescription will soon be available to provide immediate access to mytesi for patient face reimbursement challenge and a bridge drug program will soon be available for patient who have a lapse in insurance coverage
to support provider patient with access service from reimbursement and prior authorization support to appeal and patient assistance dispense for Mytesi Napo be work with florida-based assistrx to design and implement a comprehensive patient support service program
assistrx have extensive experience support hiv patient and have develop a industry-leading technology platform call iAssist to streamline therapy initiation
we new market action strategy be also design to significantly increase the number of specialty pharmacy involve in Mytesi 's distribution
Specialty pharmacy offer a high-touch patient engagement model to help ensure appropriate use of drug like mytesi and optimal patient outcome
the fact that we expand patient support program be launch during the covid-19_pandemic should especially benefit mytesi patient who may have lose job or health insurance during the crisis
we be remove barrier for patient to access mytesi and the change we have institute should help ensure patient can employ good social distancing practice while still obtain they medication
Diarrhea be a chronic life-altering condition in hiv patient on art and it be we goal to remove mytesi access hurdle for all patient in need regardless of they income level as well as for they provider especially during this national crisis
that conclude my comment for today
Steve I will now turn the discussion over to you
thank you Ian
and thanks for those of you on the phone to make time to join we this_morning
my name be Steven King
I be the Chief sustainable supply Ethnobotanical Research & Intellectual Property Officer for Jaguar and Napo
to begin I be happy to report that Napo be inform last week on April 1 that it receive additional preclinical service from the National Institute of Allergy and infectious disease to support the development of lechlemer Napo 's growth product candidate for cholera indication
under NIAID 's suite of preclinical service niaid-funded contractor will conduct toxicology testing for a 28-day rat study
NIAID be part of the National Institute of Health
as previously announce under NIAID 's suite of preclinical service these niaid-funded contractor conduct toxicology testing for a 7-day rat and dog study
cholera be a acute diarrheal illness cause by the infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholera
accord to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services a estimate 3 million to 5 million cholera case and more than cholera related death occur each year around the world
the death be due to dehydration not the cholera infection itself
it simply occur in the first 2 to 18 hour after the infection
Lechlemer which we also refer to as sb-300 have the same mechanism of action as crofelemer and be significantly less costly to produce
we have previously present phase ii datum on crofelemer for the treatment of the devastating diarrhea in cholera patient from the renowned International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka Bangladesh
until permit we plan to follow the same study design for lechlemer follow the same protocol use the same principle investigator and use the same clinical trial site in Bangladesh for the development voucher from the FDA for cholera indication
priority review voucher be grant by the FDA to drug developer as a incentive to develop treatment for neglect disease and rare pediatric disease
as many of you be no doubt aware Napo 's mission date back to the company 's founding be to discover and develop novel safe and effective plant-based prescription medicine that can be responsibly harvest to meet urgent global health care need
Crofelemer the active ingredient in mytesi we fda-approved nonopioid prescription drug indicate for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patient live with hiv on antiretroviral therapy be extract and purify from the Amazon rainforest tree croton lechlerus
the latex of the Croton lechleri tree have a rich history of medicinal use by indigenous people in South America
at present as a result of the covid-19_pandemic there be a great deal of information from global media relate to another plant-based medicine one that be change the world a long time ago
the medicine I be refer to be quinine which be discover originally by the quechua people of Ecuador Peru and Bolivia who use the bark of the amazonian tree cinchona officinalis to treat fever inflammation and pain
other explorer from South America learn about quinine 's additional property in the beginning of the 17th century
quinine remain a important anti-malarial drug almost 400 year after its effectiveness be first document
Quinine and quinidine be still fda-approved drug use to treat cardiac disorder digestive problem and muscle spasm
Quinine come to the world as malarial treatment that allow european nation to develop and explore across the region that have be devastate by uncontrolled malaria
the synthetic derivative of quinine atabrine and chloroquine be develop between and to prevent and treat malaria before and after World War II
chloroquine and another synthetic derivative hydroxychloroquine be also use today to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
there be now medical research focus on the potential to use these synthetic derivative of quinine to combat covid-19
it be not clear if these drug will prove to be safe and/or effective for covid-19 but I believe it be worth remember that the medical practice in discovery of new therapeutics have use method of medical knowledge in diseased people and the vast datum use for century as part of they traditional medicine
in fact as a interesting historical footnote Winston Churchill reportedly once have say that the gin and tonic save more Englishmen 's life and mind than all the doctor in the Empire
the so-called tonic in the original gin and tonic be quinine
I be very proud of the fact that mytesi also have its root in traditional medicine and I be proud that mytesi as a pipeline in a product a term frequently employ by Lisa be be develop as multiple possible follow-on indication
with Napo 's daring commitment for development and commercialize traditional plant-based medicine we expect that it will not be another 100 year before they be once again make aware of the reason of conserve and leverage traditional medical knowledge
Pravin onto you
thank you Steve
good morning everybody
thanks for join
and my name be Pravin Chaturvedi and I be the chair of Napo Scientific Advisory Board and also serve as the Chief Scientific Officer of Napo Pharmaceuticals and Jaguar Health
as Lisa mention earlier Napo be plan the initiation of preclinical trial for crofelemer in the second half of 2020 a pivotal trial for the indication of prevention and treatment of cancer therapy-related diarrhea call CTD in adult cancer patient a target indication we refer to as ctd and pediatric study for diarrheal disease orphan gastrointestinal disorder such as short bowel syndrome I will refer to it as SBS these be be plan
for the adult CTD study we have be in active discussion with the FDA and with key opinion leader clinical protocol to accommodate they input and be prepare the requisite document include the statistical analysis plan base on consent and other requirement to initiate the pivotal adult ctd trial under a new IND.
the principal investigator for the ctd trial be at a major institution major cancer institution in the United_States
we goal be to ensure that the protocol address the unmet medical need for the treatment of CTD combine with the practicality of patient enrollment and trial design
but we be also ensure that statistician from both Napo Pharmaceuticals and the FDA agree on the endpoint that be relevant to crofelemer 's unique physiological mechanism of action
we planned study for CTD be analogous to the successful pivotal trial for mytesi 's currently-approved hiv indication and as a part of we risk mitigation strategy we intend to use the same formulation and dosing as the currently commercialize mytesi
in addition to work with the key opinion leader on clinical strategy and trial design we have be coordinate with the Multinational Association of supportive care in cancer also refer to as mascc
we be support they effort to ascertain guideline for the treatment and management of diarrhea in cancer patient
we be a gold level sponsor for the MASCC Conference which be to be hold in Spain in June this year
however it have be postpone for obvious reason at this time
however we will continue to work with the leadership team of mascc and provide they a good support while we all work through the challenge of this global pandemic
for the pediatric clinical study in the orphan indication of short bowl syndrome we prepare a dossier to support the pre-ind discussion with the FDA
and we have submit it and we expect the FDA to revert to we in approximately 30 day with they input on the pre-ind package
this pre-ind release document from Napo outline the plan for clinical trial in short bowl syndrome and potentially and congenital diarrheal disorder as well as provide the rationale for address diarrhea to reduce the nutritional requirement in child with either short bowel syndrome or congenital diarrheal disorder
SBS and CDD short bowel syndrome and congenital diarrheal disorder be much more prevalent in region such as the Middle East and North Africa region the mena region where there be consanguineous marriage
and we be pleased to actually have the support of the key opinion leader in that region Dr. Mohamad Miqdady from the Sheikh Khalifa Medical Center in Abu Dhabi who be provide we with the leadership and guidance to conduct appropriate clinical study in the mena region
as mention earlier reduction of enteral and/or parenteral nutritional requirement in these child with sbs or congenital diarrheal disorder would improve both the quality of they life as well as improve the odds of they survival
hence we be plan for potentially do pediatric clinical study that will provide evidence of safety of mytesi as well as proof of efficacy in SBS and/or cdd patient
I will now pass the microphone back on to Lisa for she comment close comment
thank you
over to you Lisa
thanks Pravin
thank you to all the speaker and thank you to all the listener
in closing I be proud to announce this past February the nonprofit american Botanical Council have give the Varro E. Tyler Commercial Investment in Phytomedicinal Research award to Napo in recognition of Napo 's ongoing commitment to the sustainable development and production of natural therapeutic preparation
we have to miss that award ceremony for obvious reason as well
specifically this award acknowledge the successful development and approval of crofelemer which be derive as Steve say from the traditional croton lechlerus tree in the Amazon rainforest
the development of crofelemer have be the key mission of Napo 's core team member for more than 30 year and we remain fully commit to expand crofelemer access to all patient in need throughout the world
previous recipient of this award include we partner italian-based Indena one of the world 's largest producer of clinically-tested botanical extract for the pharmaceutical market
as a reminder mytesi be the first and only oral plant-based prescription medicine drug approve under FDA 's botanical guidance
and there be no pathway by which a generic product can be develop for a drug approve under botanical guidance
I be extremely please with we achievement in and continue to be grateful for the ongoing support and dedication of we employee stockholder and all of we stakeholder as we continue effort in to grow sale bring on more partner across multiple possible follow-on indication to mytesi and drive this company to a break-even cash flow positive situation
I be also very proud to be work with the team with such high integrity and value which have be display probably during this time of global crisis
I will repeat the word of Tez Anderson
this be not we first pandemic Lisa
and we be grateful to be work together to make a difference in the life of people live with chronic life-altering gi condition
as I say earlier we believe have the potential to be a transformative year for Jaguar and Napo
with that we conclude we comment

good afternoon everyone and thank you for join we q1 earnings call which will be unlike most typical quarterly earnings call as while we will cover q1 result we will focus more on update you on where we be with the crisis at hand and how we be navigate the uncertainty that we be all face
what be happen in the world around we be not just a human tragedy but will likely result in a significant global economic tragedy
the biggest challenge we be all deal with right_now be uncertainty
how long will this continue
how deep of a economic crisis do the pandemic create
how will the consumer respond when the crisis abate
and ultimately what be the shape size and scope of the apparel sector when it be over
frankly try to forecast this be nearly impossible
no one can control the virus or even the economic fallout but we can control how we react to the crisis
I be very optimistic about we prospects for the_future both navigate through the crisis in the short to medium term and in the long term recovery and I believe we be well position if not better positioned than most company in we industry
we have a great first quarter
we business be hum come into the crisis again reaffirm the robust strategy that we be execute and the momentum we have prior to the crisis erupt globally
but beyond the strength of we business and the underlie momentum here be why I be confident that we will emerge stronger on the other side
we have one of the world 's most iconic most love brand in Levi 's and consumer will come back to brand that they love and trust
we have not go dark either
we be invest in strengthen we bond with we fan during these moment of isolation
we have a strong balance_sheet and $ 1.8 billion of liquidity
we have a experienced management team that have a track record of make tough choice to cut cost just as we do back in
we have aggressively cut cost before and we be on it now
inventory be down and a significant majority of we inventory be core replenishment which can be carry over to future season
we be focus on innovation
F.L.X. will be a advantage during this time as we will be able to bring newness when store reopen regardless of when that be
and the innovation over the last month leverage digital tool throughout this organization have be awesome
we strategy to diversify the business which we have be execute now for year make we less vulnerable to the shock that may be feel in some country and channel
we dtc business be now more than 40 % of we total business up from under 30 % 5 year ago
we e-commerce business have more than double in the last 5 year and be we fastest-growing business
finally we have something nobody else in this industry can claim a company history of 167 year
we have be through other crisis some perhaps even more existential than what we be currently face
we have see it all the Great Depression world war earthquake fire and yes even the flu pandemic
not only do we pull-through all of these we use crisis to galvanize the path forward and we will do it again
I also believe that crisis present opportunity and we will be ready to act on those that make good strategic sense whether that be take back underperform franchise business or upgrade real estate location because of other retailer bankruptcy or find great talent in a decimate job market
the crisis give we a opportunity to not just renew the business but to reset it for the_future
net we be not manage through the crisis by play defense
we will play to we strength leverage the strength of the brand we connection with we fan and the digital capability and omnichannel capability that we have invest in over the last few year
at the same time we do not have we head in the sand
we will also be aggressive on cost takeout in light of the impact that the crisis will have on revenue and we structural economics but we will be deliberate and thoughtful about how we do this so we do not cut core capability and the thing that have create we success over the last few year
let I give you a little more color on a few of these area
first we be very focus on engage with we fan during they isolation cultivate a deeper love for the Levi 's brand
just when the music festival season be suppose to start all festival have be cancel or postpone
to help fill the void we launch a month-long virtual music festival with we Instagram Live 5:01 concert series
each week night at 5:01 pm artist such as Snoop Dogg and Brett Young be perform live in they Levi 's connect this series have be so extremely positive and we be find more user be view these live session every day
this be something that be authentic
truly something only Levi 's could do
we be also replicate digital strategy that work in China during and after they lockdown by feature do-it-yourself content on we website that inspire we fan to customize they Levi 's product at home
second we be pivot we marketing approach in response to the current environment
for example we recently launch Super Mario collaboration with Nintendo be fly off the shelf in China and it be also resonate in we e-commerce site in Europe because we build excitement and demand through social media campaign
the Super Mario collection will be drop in the U.S. later this week
people be look to connect these day and Super Mario put a smile on everyone 's face
Third as you know we recently launch the Levi 's brand mobile app and we be build loyalty with fan around the world give they another way to engage with the brand and another option for they to shop in whatever format they prefer
we have see early success with strong consumer acquisition and enrollment rate and monthly engagement with exclusive product offering like the recent launch of we authorize vintage collection which have be sell through very well
we will continue to scale and ramp we loyalty program and the app throughout this_year
the culture of innovation deeply embedded at LS&C o. be help we evolve how we be work internally as a team and with we customer during this crisis
for example we have accelerate the rollout of new technology we develop in we Eureka Innovation Lab photorealistic 3d rendering of denim garment and sample
this allow we to digitize the sampling process enable we to sell to merchant from image rather than require physical sample
we leverage this technology recently in we most recent line assortment meeting
normally this meeting bring around merchant and marketer to we San Francisco headquarters from around the world and be follow by cascade meeting over multiple week as they engage with they regional and local counterpart
by leverage this digital technology to hold the meeting virtually we be able to engage everyone simultaneously and complete this process in one meeting take week out of we go-to-market cycle
the feedback be that this may have be the best assortment meeting ever and we may never go back to live meeting
this technology and other like it will drive efficiency speed to market and reduce waste while improve we operation through and beyond the crisis
finally as we navigate this time of crisis we will continue to be guide by we value and long-standing commitment to profit through principle
support we community through tough challenge be nothing new to ls&c o
we have a legacy of leadership and of do the right thing and we be take step to fulfill that responsibility again
we response to the covid-19 impact will evolve as the crisis continue to play_out
but to start with we have announce a $ 3 million philanthropic program in partnership with the Levi Strauss Foundation and we be work with the foundation to launch a match campaign for we employee donation to community group step up to meet local need and organization support covid-19 effort from ensure out-of-school student still have access to meal to deliver need supplies to homebound senior citizen
additionally the Red Tab Foundation which support we employee and retiree with short-term grant to help they get through try time be expand its effort
Harmit will review the aggressive cost action we be take in light of this situation but I want to cover the compensation and furlough-related announcement we be make today
we Board member will forego they cash compensation and we be announce broad salary cut for executive and leader across the organization include 50_% from I
and effective April 13 we be furlough all U.S. hourly retail employee and we wholesale merchandise coordinator
in closing I will say again while this will be a challenging time with significant uncertainty we will be laser-focused on what be within we control to mitigate the impact to the degree possible as the world grapple with the virus and the economic fallout
we have many strength on we side that I be confident will bring we through the current environment a iconic and beloved Levi 's brand that have never be stronger a solid balance_sheet a skilled dedicated and courageous leadership team that will take aggressive action on cost a culture of innovation and strategy that have transform the business over the last 8 year that will help we chart we course through the coming month
we be take swift and decisive action to ensure we remain a winner in we industry and that we emerge from the storm as strong or stronger than go into it
the true character of a company be show in a time of crisis and as we have in the_past we will navigate this one by leverage we strength and seize opportunity that will help we continue to thrive over the long term
I will now turn it over to Harmit to walk through the_quarter in further detail
Harmit
thank you chip
good afternoon to all of you
I hope all of you you family and love one be safe and healthy
the coronavirus be have far-reaching consequence around the world
before I walk you through we result for the_quarter let I share what we be do now to respond to the challenge of covid-19
we focus be to balance cash preservation and profit protection
to that end we be ensure adequate cash_flow and liquidity to navigate the choppy water include suspend we share buyback program and draw down on we revolver
we be actively manage we supply_chain and inventory flow while leverage we F.L.X. platform while cut we second half purchase and evaluate the most efficient way to reflow the small amount of seasonal item we have on hand and soon we will leverage exist capability such as ship from store to help manage inventory
on cost management we be substantially reduce advertising spend and we be pull SG&A lever available to we to cut cost in we business operation such as the compensation cut and furlough chip mention freezing travel and headcount significantly reduce variable expense and negotiate with landlord to abate rent for the period store be close
and we be reduce we capital spend on discretionary project while reevaluate we store rollout plan
we be defer we new distribution center in Europe and be now target a reduction in annual capex spend of up to 30 %
we have close the majority of we door and those of we franchise partner to help slow the spread of the virus
currently about 70 % of these door be close 20_% be fully open and the balance be operate on reduce hour
with respect to we first fiscal quarter of 2020 we be pleased to have deliver strong revenue growth record-high gross margin and adjust diluted ep ahead of we expectation
and if it be not for the virus impact we would have exceed we adjusted ebit expectation as well
the underlie momentum of we business continue to be very strong as well as we balance_sheet and return on invest capital
this be especially true in we global store fleet where the 3-year average return on invest capital for the fleet be over 20_%
as I walk you through additional detail on we first quarter result my comment will reference constant currency comparison on a year-over-year basis in U.S. dollar unless I indicate otherwise
we publish the detail of we report and constant currency result in today 's press_release so I will not repeat all of those here
first quarter net revenue of $ 1.5 billion grow 6 %
the estimate $ 20 million adverse impact in Asia of the coronavirus combine with the unrest in Hong Kong adversely impact revenue growth by about 2 percentage point
also note that we be lap a strong first quarter 2019 which we grow 11 % overall
Levi 's man 's volume be flat for the_quarter
we global we top global wholesale account collectively grow 5 % and we top mature market grow 3 % and within that the U.S. be up 2 % for the_quarter
we total woman 's business grow 12 % in the_first_quarter on the back of high-teens growth last_year
and we total top business grow 5 %
direct-to-consumer grow 13 % for the_quarter
revenue from we brick-and-mortar store be up 14 % globally and global e-commerce be up 12 %
we total digital ecosystem grow double digit in q1 and now comprise more than 15 % of we total company 's revenue double the size of what it be just 3 year ago
Gross margin in the_first_quarter be 55.7 % a record high for the company
this represent a increase of basis_point on a report basis reflect the benefit from the price increase we have take as well as higher direct-to-consumer and international growth
Currency effect be negligible
adjust ebit margin of 12.6 % decline basis_point on a report basis entirely due to we plan to smooth advertising higher charge from equity-settled award and the timing of and the timing of related payroll tax and approximately $ 10 million of lose adjusted ebit from the coronavirus
the benefit of black Friday revenue in the current year which favorably impact adjust EBIT margin by about basis_point be substantially offset by a estimate basis_point adverse impact from the coronavirus
adjust diluted ep for the_first_quarter of $ 0.40 increase $ 0.02 on a report basis compare to the same quarter in the prior year slightly trail 8 % report adjusted net income growth due to the increase in the company 's share count result from we IPO
the estimate adverse impact of the coronavirus be $ 0.02
Currency unfavorably impact adjusted net income by percentage point and adjust ep diluted ep by $ 0.01
now I will share more detail on the first quarter result of we region in constant currency unless I state otherwise
we result benefit from the calendar 2019 black Friday week which fall into we fiscal q1
as such my regional comment today will focus on we business result adjust for black Friday
first quarter revenue in the Americas be flat when adjust for black Friday
we be really pleased with direct-to-consumer growth of 10_% when adjust for black Friday which be a combination of e commerce growth new brick-and-mortar store in the region and same-store sale growth
the region 's direct-to-consumer growth be offset primarily by a decline in U.S. wholesale which be down 4 % when adjust for lower shipment to off price
this be a bit better than we expectation especially as we be lap high single-digit U.S. wholesale growth in the_prior_year
so on a 2-year stack U.S. wholesale be positive
we woman 's business continue to be the standout of U.S. wholesale where it grow double digit this_quarter
Europe 's revenue be up 11 % when adjust for black Friday with growth again broad-based across channel product segment and market and this be another quarter of lap double-digit growth in the_prior_year
direct-to-consumer revenue be up 9 % adjust for black Friday and wholesale revenue be up 12 % on broad growth across market and we customer base
the woman 's business post another quarter of stellar growth up 19 % versus last_year
and Levi 's man 's margin grow a impressive 10_% fuel by innovative new fit that resonate with consumer
in Asia we estimate net revenue growth of 9 % when adjust for decline relate to the coronavirus in the region and the political unrest in Hong Kong
most of the region 's market grow
in China prior to initiate store closure in response to the outbreak we turnaround strategy be really gain traction as double-digit revenue growth be eclipse we internal expectation there
at the peak nearly all we door be close and although traffic remain well below prior year level we have now reopen all we company-operated store in China include we beacon store in Wuhan and all but franchise door
though sale in China remain down to prior year performance be sequentially improve each week with we mainline store performance lead the charge give the premium collection therein
and the company be in the process of take back store in Guangzhou and Chengdu from we prior franchise partner
sale of we digital footprint in China mean we e-commerce site and those operate by we partner grow in March versus prior year in particular drive by the strong growth in woman 's fashion fit
we leverage we partnership with tmall in the launch of we Super Mario collaboration generate a ton of buzz and strong sell-through
and China 's gross margin in March be higher than prior year reflect the favorable revenue shift towards the direct-to-consumer channel
we be encourage by the progress we have see in China and we be use artificial intelligence and consumer insight to inform the playbook we will use for other market as they begin to recover
turn to balance sheet and cash flow
in dollar term total inventory at the end of the first quarter be down 7 % compare to a year prior continue the positive inventory leverage trend
the composition of inventory be healthy with more than 70 % be evergreen product that carry over well into future season
we have full visibility into we inventory across all stage of we supply_chain and we be work proactively leverage the strong relationship we have with we supplier and customer around inventory level and have aggressively cut purchase and cancel order for the second half of 2020
we be work with we supplier to manage the flow of finish goods in line with reduce demand in the short term
we be pull all agility lever include F.L.X. which be unique to LS&C o. to respond to change in demand
we be work to extend the life cycle of the inventory we have on hand by carry evergreen product forward into subsequent season while infuse some new product in by carry over fabric into product for subsequent season as much as possible
even in a promotional environment give the strength of we brand and inventory action we believe we can strike a good balance between gross margin and drive revenue
we have build a very healthy balance_sheet and end the_quarter with access to nearly $ 1 billion in cash and another $ 820 million available under we credit facility which be back by strong high-quality financial institution
and we next debt maturity come in
cash be king in situation like this so in the current environment we feel it prudent to further augment we cash on hand and accordingly draw $ 300 million on we credit facility last week
this bring available cash to $ 1.2 billion while retain availability of more than $ 0.5 billion on we revolver
with nearly $ 1.8 billion in total liquidity we be better positioned than many to meet this challenge in the near term and emerge stronger when thing normalize
we will continue to deploy capital on a disciplined basis so as to fuel select long-term growth initiative although at a prudently lower level with fewer store opening than we announce on we last call
we be also stick with quarterly dividend payment for now and have announce we second quarter dividend which will again be $ 0.08 per share
this will bring first half dividend to approximately $ 64 million a increase of 16 % as compare to the first half of 2019
we will reassess dividend for the balance of the_year as the situation evolve
under we share buyback program we have already repurchase a sufficient number of share to offset we employee stock grant dilution estimate
base on present circumstance we do not anticipate the need to do further share buyback for the remainder of the_year and accordingly have suspend the program
and finally a word on guidance
give the unprecedented phenomenon of the coronavirus pandemic and the significant economic uncertainty it introduce we have make the decision to withdraw guidance for the time be
once we believe that we have sufficient visibility to reinstate guidance we will do so
in summary prior to when the coronavirus start to impact we result we business trend and financial result be very strong
and even in the current situation we remain a strong purpose-driven company with powerful iconic brand and a confident outlook on we long-term growth opportunity once we emerge from the current crisis
we be geographically diversify which will provide we the ability to capture best practice as well as sale as they come back in various market
we global diversified supply_chain be agile enough to enable we to wisely manage inventory and to maximize we opportunity for work capital efficiency
we be be nimble in response to the develop situation
in addition to the action we be take now we will continue to drive lower cost as necessary to mitigate the profitability
to mitigate the okay
we be take we be be nimble in response to the develop situation
in response to the action we be take now we will continue to drive lower cost as necessary to mitigate the profitability pressure from lower revenue
and we will rightsize capital development to cover we highest priority in order to preserve and drive the most efficient use of cash
we strong balance_sheet provide we sufficient liquidity to carry we through this difficult time
we have a deep talent base around the world and most importantly we be one of the most iconic apparel brand love by fan worldwide and increasingly by younger consumer who care about company that do well and do good
we will focus on what we can control and expect to emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company
with that we will now open it up and take you question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- you first question be from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan
next participant be from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America
glad to hear everything be go well and everyone be in good health
can you just talk about how you various wholesale partner in Europe and in the U.S. be respond to this in term of work capital and in term of inventory order
and then can you talk about the lever and tool you have to manage work capital during this downturn
Heather glad to see you safe and healthy
thanks for ask the question
we be bless that we have customer and wholesale partner that we have great relationship with
we be work with each one of they on a case-by-case basis
we be collect the cash that be owe to we
we be manage inventory
the good news be that as I mention give that we inventory level be generally healthy as we enter the_quarter and end the we be in a good spot
a large piece of we inventory include the in-trade inventory be core
so we believe that once the retailer open they store and we open we store we will be able to work through that
and we be in discussion with we partner
we be ask they to pay we what they owe we which be the standing of a good relationship and we be work through with they to be ready when the crisis be over and behind we
one other quick thing I would add Heather be we do have customer that be still in business and still open they door and still shipping product
so Walmart target Amazon here in the U.S. be all trading and we be still ship product to they and same be true with some of the pure-play e-commerce player in Europe
so we do have some revenue right_now and some consumer transaction happen in wholesale
but as you know the majority of the large department store chain here in the U.S. be close
and that be largely true in Europe across Europe as well
we have we next question from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan
Great
and congrat on a nice quarter
so chip as we think about the brand 's top and bottom line acceleration into the crisis I think you prepared remark be actually really interesting
I guess how do you weigh market share versus profitability to emerge from this as a stronger brand as you say without take some level of a step back
yes
so I sort of talk about it in the prepared remark we be very focus right_now on how do we come out of this stronger as a company but also how do the Levi 's brand come out of this crisis even stronger
so let I hit a couple of thing on why I think that be possible
First of all come into the crisis there be a very good proof point about the strength of the brand and that be call pricing power
we have be talk about price power
we take pricing at the end of last year and you see it flow through in the gross margin and gross profit line this_year I mean or this past quarter q1
so nothing better demonstrate the strength of a brand than the ability to price
and we do that successfully in q1
second we be continue to invest during this period
we have not go completely dark
we be cut back to be very clear we be cut back on A&P but we be be deliberate and strategic about action that we can take to strengthen the relationship between the brand and the consumer
and the concert series be I think a great proof point of that
and every day it just keep get more momentum
we be try to find way to connect more strongly with consumer during the period of time that they be coop up
Third be on the product front
we be go to continue to bring newness
this Super Mario from Nintendo collaboration that be drop in China and Asia and Europe and drop later this week here bring some fun and some newness to the brand
so we be not stop
we be not pause
we be continue to go forward on product and product innovation
and finally we be go to continue to leverage digital everything digital
so we launch the app a few month ago and that be off to a really good start
we have get we loyalty program we be go to continue to double down on that and we e-commerce business
and then I guess the last thing I would say be I do believe crisis create opportunity
there be go to be some player in this industry that do not make it and that be go to open up real estate opportunity for we potentially
it could we could wind up be the share beneficiary of other not make it
and as I kind of cruise the internet and instagram and look at we Facebook page and stuff a lot of people be write about well I be work at home I be kick back in my Levi 's and it be become a Levi 's moment
and I think that give we something to build on as we come out of this crisis
so we be really focus on it and I be very very confident that whatever the shock be to the consumer and the economy when the consumer do emerge from hibernation they be go to want to go back to the brand that they love and to the brand that they be comfortable with and they have get a relationship with
and that be why I believe we be poise to win in this environment
Great
maybe to switch gear to Europe
so it be close to of you sale
it be be a meaningful driver of growth
so maybe precrisis can you speak to profitability metric and driver of the pricing power that you be see in Europe
and then as we think postcrisis just the remain opportunity as we think about the profitability and pricing opportunity that you continue to see in Europe
sure
Matt precrisis as you know we have be grow Europe now in the mid-teens and for a couple of see clear leverage which mean that we have be grow the top line as well as drive leverage to the bottom line
we do take pricing in the second half of last year
that pricing stick and have continue to stick just until just before the crisis
the brand be very very strong
we entire portfolio of product be resonate really well in Europe
so think man 's bottom which be up 10_% in the_quarter
we woman 's business grow 19 % on top of real strong growth the previous year
and so we have also continue to see growth in top
execution continue to be very strong across both franchise and we company operation
so we view be that as store begin to reopen the strength of the brand besides all the pricing that we take and the wonderful execution that the team on the ground bring to the market I think will stand we well especially as some of we other peer or competitor who be in a tougher position think through thing differently
so we have gain market share
we think we will emerge out of the crisis a lot stronger
next question be from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup
I be curious and I be sorry if I miss it but do you say that you have see a acceleration in you e-com sale since store have be close
and curious what you be see in term of change to the basket size and mix of business
and just curious if online sale may be skewed towards bottom versus top more so these day than normal
yes Paul
so the acceleration or the growth in the digital business we have see in China
so China at the end of the first month as store have open the business be positive year-over-year
across we other e-commerce business the business be broadly flat I would say
Asia be up
Asia be positive
Europe and the U.S. be slightly down
so overall the business have be flat
in term of you question of bottom and top the ratio both in China as well as in the U.S. be broadly the same it be before the crisis
so we have not see any dramatic change in the mix of the business
no zoom effect
thanks Harmit
and just to be clear
I mean I think the other it be important to note that over the_year we have continue to add stretch in we bottom
and I think at last count over 80 % of we bottom have reasonable amount of stretch
so to Chip 's point people work at home probably be feel a lot more comfortable
yes
and can you also talk about in you dtc business first quarter ex black Friday strong performance
I be just curious if you could break down e-com versus full price versus factory store
I think if you look at we first quarter one we brick-and-mortar be up e-commerce be up
I do not have the e-commerce number on top of my head ex black Friday
but I do not have it off the top of my head but I would say both be reasonably strong from that perspective
you next question be from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley
okay
fantastic
I want to start with just understand what percentage of you total inventory would have some sort of a seasonal element as oppose to evergreen sort of product
if you could help we understand that because perhaps there be less markdown risk on the evergreen product
and then secondarily what be you hear from you vendor in term of third quarter order or fourth quarter order
what be the early look at you at you order book
and then lastly what sort of markdown support or margin support be you wholesale partner currently look for
yes
Kimberly as I say the good news be we have work away at inventory and improve inventory turn over the last couple of year
so the inventory leverage which be the growth or the decline in inventory relative to the growth in revenue have be positive
so we enter the_quarter with inventory down 7 %
70 % of that be core
I would say seasonal inventory be about 15 % to 20_%
and we be work through with both we wholesale partner as well as franchisee in way and mean we can as the store open sell that product
I think go back to what Chip say the strength of the brand as well as the newness that we product bring to bear we be generally confident that we can balance grow revenue and gross margin
the other thing on gross margin just to you point we be start at a very good spot
we gross margin be at a record high
and I think that will bode we well both through the crisis as well as we emerge out of it
to you question about the discussion on order book et_cetera again it be case by case
we have adjust we inventory base on the demand signal we have get
we have a fairly flexible supply_chain and so if thing come back faster we can flex it up
we also have the F.L.X. platform where we can chase fashion trend because we have length which be again something that be go to be a competitive differentiation for we relative to the rest of the folk in the apparel industry
I guess the only other thing to add be just real briefly be and I think we say it in the prepared remark but we have cut all unfilled purchase order in the second half of the_year
so we be try to aggressively manage the second half inventory in term of inbound just recognize that everybody all of we customer be go to have to work off this inventory from they store be close
but the good news be more than 70 % of we inventory be core replenishment and that can carry over to the next season
Great
okay
then last for I
I understand that when China reopen the store be still comp down
if you think about the last week or what be sort of the magnitude of the recent performance in comparable store sale for China
yes
I hate talk about average on a store base of store
we have mix performance there
we have some store that be already comp ahead of prior year and we have some that be still significantly down versus prior year
but I think what be important be since the store start reopen traffic have kind of improve sequentially kind of week over week
and we business performance in the aggregate have improve week over week and we be see we e-commerce business now comp consumer be come back albeit maybe a little bit tentatively but there be there be green shoot of optimism
it be also worth note that we mainline door particularly the one that have we more premium assortment in they seem to be do best right_now versus prior year
and that may be part of the playbook as we go forward
and gross margin Kimberly you hear I say gross margin be up
we have we next question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim
I be just wonder if you guy I be wonder if you could talk a little bit more just like U.S. wholesale but specifically the mass channel in term of what you have see there what you be see there
a lot of discussion around top in mass versus bottom in mass
I be just wonder if maybe you could just talk to those trend even post quarter end
okay
well I do kind of allude to it that both Walmart and target be still open and we continue to be very optimistic about the test which we have now continue to expand we be kind of north of door with target feel really really good about that
as harmit mention earlier we have not really see a dramatic shift from bottom to top
I know a lot of people be talk about that and they be call it the zoom effect
people be wear they pajamas down below and a nice top up above
but we have not really see a dramatic shift to we mix from top to bottom on we business
so we be encourage with the business performance of Levi 's Red Tab at target
we also have we value brand Signature and Denizen in Walmart and target
and they actually be flattish down about point or point versus the_prior_year in q1
and that may have be we be still try to figure out how much of that be consumer and consumption-driven versus those customer shift they open-to-buy budget to other household necessity toilet paper paper towel hand sanitizer and food
I suspect it be probably more of the latter than it be the former
so we will see as this crisis unfold
but I do think it be important to say that we do have a portfolio of brand and these value brand play a role in we portfolio
and as the consumer get shocked and potentially as we see big spike of unemployment we have get a brand there for the consumer and it be great product at that value price point
get it
and in term of the supply_chain generally have you be able to procure everything sort of timely
and have that be operate for you pretty smoothly
we be good right_now
well I be just I mean very shortly in short yes we be good
and we be good with what we have on hand right_now
and particularly with just about everybody be close we be more than good
and we be pretty confident about what we have come in for the second half
so a good part of the second half be already produce and wait to go onto boat to ship over here for later in the summer when it should be hit consumer or customer floor
Harmit I do not know I be sorry if I cut you off
yes
no worry chip
this be a wonderful virtual dialogue
but I would say other thing Bob
first as a value-based company that be be around 167 year we be take full responsibility for finish ready to-ship order
and we be work on timetable adjust timetable with we vendor
we have a program in place for we vendor to get early payment at favorable market rate and several vendor take advantage of this already
we be look at way to expand this program to the benefit of vendor
and last but not the least chip talk about a $ 3 million grant
of that we be grant $ 1 million to organization that support apparel supply chain worker with a focus on public health response particularly for woman and we be work with industry stakeholder to explore option for broader collective response so that we can support worker during this crisis
so we be do a lot more than just make sure the goods we need be deliver
get it
and if I could just sneak in one more question
I know that the Nintendo Super Mario Bros. launch have go well internationally
be it true that Chris Ogle get a early pair for the one here in the U.S. and that be what he be wear during this conference call
he be absolutely wear it
how do you know
that be crazy
a little birdie tell I that
it be true
it be a really fun product
it hit later this week
so hopefully everybody will go out and get some
thanks Bob
you next question be from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI
next question be from the line of Jay Sole from UBS
Great
chip you mention there could be some real estate opportunity that arise from this situation
just related to that can you talk about any progress you have make over the last quarter develop the full price store model for the U.S.
yes
it be we remain really optimistic about this new store model which be smaller footprint better location
we have get a couple of they
we have a few more come
we be not stop those
those be still plan to open later this summer
the one I always talk about as a example be the Stanford mall
we need to I guess get a little bit more clarity on how long and how deep and how much of a problem do we really have here from a financial standpoint before we can commit to whether we would accelerate that model or not
I mean as Harmit say balance_sheet and cash be king right_now and we do not want to get out over we ski from a capital standpoint
but we be bullish about this and I be very optimistic about it impact and it will create opportunity and it could create opportunity for we to find more of those kind of location more quickly
and if we have get the financial strength and flexibility we may pounce on it and not miss the opportunity to capitalize on the environment and the situation that be go to happen
so we remain optimistic about it
these store the one that we have open that be kind of along the line of this model be profitable
I think Harmit say it in the script but we roic on we store base right_now on a global basis be like 20_%
so we clearly have a opportunity for more mainline door here in the U.S.
we only have a little bit more than right_now
so we will take advantage of the opportunity if the right opportunity come along
get it
and then maybe if I could just ask one more on inventory
you talk about the uncertainty of the situation and it be get to be difficult to plan for holiday not know how consumer be go to behave and if they be go to be come back to store or if they be go to increase shopping online
can you just touch on a little bit more the kind of flexibility that you have to be able to shift inventory between store and online
just to react to whatever happen as we go through the rest of the_year
yes
well I would say first and most importantly we have develop the ability to ship from store
we can fulfill e-commerce order from store and in fact we be go to start firing that back up here in the next week or so just so we can mitigate the potential risk of we e-commerce distribution center or the largest distribution center potentially get shut_down
I mean in a number of state distribution center that be not ship food or medicine be get shut_down as not be necessary or business-essential
and so we want to mitigate that possible risk and we have build that muscle that capability
so that be the first thing I would say
the second thing be we have get I talk about we e-commerce site it be basically we best store and it have a large variety of pc9 and assortment that we have in both we mainline and outlet door
and we have plenty of flexibility to shift inventory from store to e-commerce and in both direction
so we have get maximum flexibility to do it
hey thanks Jay
be Omar back
yes Omar
yes we can
yes
he just text I
I think he be back
so operator can you try and see if you can get Omar back
otherwise we will do one more question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- you next question be from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI
be you guy there
can you hear I
apology if this have be ask but I want to kind of dive into the consumer behavior side of this equation
I know it be easy and entice to talk about the pre-coronavirus world and the post-coronavirus world
but it be not yet clear I think how long we be go to be in this coronavirus world and what it mean on consumer behavior
so anything you be learn in how consumer be act in China or different part of China
any thought on how consumer behavior might be the same or different in you category in Europe or North_America
and then I guess be the key here when you can reopen store
or be the key here when consumer feel comfortable and safe to go back to thing like concert and music festival and other kind of public bar and happy hour jeans and casual attire occasion
or so maybe you can kind of walk I through some of those thing as well
yes
well so I be the big consumer guy here and we be try to learn as much as we can in China
and I would say that China may not be a perfect model for everything that we might expect to see in the West and that be for a whole host of reason
but it be quite possible here in the West we be go to see a much bigger economic impact more job loss and we be already see it right
10 million people file for unemployment in the last 2 week
and I think all of those dynamics could potentially have a effect on the consumer
but what I can tell you about China be that as we bring we store back up freshness and newness matter
we top-selling item for woman be the new balloon fit which we literally just launch
and so they be look for fashion they be look for newness they be look for something exciting
the Super Mario Bros. collaboration that we launch on Super Brand Day on Tmall have literally take off
so newness fun-ness be go to be important I think
and we be very very conscious of that as we plan the second half to make sure that we be leave ourselves enough flexibility to make sure we have get newness on the floor when the consumer do come back
but I think what be go to happen here in the U.S. what be go to happen with the consumer it be one of the big unknown
and I kind of allude to it right at the top
it be very difficult to forecast the_future right_now not know how deep or how long this go
I would say the deeper the economic impact be and the longer everybody be coop up the more of a shock there will be to the system
and it may take longer for the consumer to come back
that be why I think it be really important that we continue to build we relationship with the consumer during this period of time of isolation
we be not go to let they forget about Levi 's while they be coop up in they home
and so build that relationship remain authentic and true to who we be
I be very excite as you know as you can tell from this the concert series that we be do
we be challenge ourselves
what be the other only Levi 's could do that kind of thing type of moment
but I still think there be a lot more we do not know than what we do know right_now
and we just have to see how the situation unfold
and but continue to play to we strength and learn from China
and as other market in Western Europe begin to come back learn from Western Europe and just keep build we playbook as we go
so that be kind of how I think about it
but as I say I mean I do think there will be winner and loser here
and give the strength of we brand consumer be go to want to come back to they favorite and to the brand that they trust and that they love
and so I think that position we really well
we have we next question from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey
chip and harmit as you guy have be talk about obviously as you have be talk about the expense management underway one of the bucket obviously be occupancy
how be you think and what be you see in term of lease term either lease renegotiation out of you fleet around the world globally whether outlet or full line
and I totally agree there be a lot of opportunity for you to get some better location even smaller one in the U.S. when all of this be say and do
yes Dana
let I take a stab at that
we be in discussion like most of other retailer with landlord
and we be see success
I think we have get some great landlord and they be be mindful of the situation
they like we be talk about the brand they also want great brand
they also want great credit
and they want brand that be go to be here for the longer term
so we be work it case by case and that be why I talk about it as a opportunity from a expense management perspective
we also have government outside the U.S. the U.K. for example in the fiscal stimulus they have give a abatement on property tax as a holiday
and so we be leverage that in different market
and we be work with the White House and the different association to try and bring similar practice in the U.S. as part of stimulus form
so I think we feel good about where we be
obviously it be difficult to generalize
but as chip earlier mention if you think about it long term there probably will be vacancy
it give we a opportunity to both expand floor space for store that be really do well as well as we grow mainline in the U.S. and grow mainline across the world it give we opportunity to get into type a location
okay
I think we will call it there
we apologize for go over a little bit longer but there be clearly some technology challenge with a couple of question
anyway thank you all for dialing in
we be in a once-in a-century type of situation right_now
and I just hope that you all will stay safe and keep you family safe and healthy
and we look forward to talk with you at the end of the next quarter
and hopefully we will be able to talk with more specifics in term of what we expect for the balance of the_year
thank you all very much for dial in and take care of yourselve
thank you presenter

good morning and thank you for join we call
with I on today 's call be Brian Ketcham we Chief_Financial_Officer
I feel it be prudent to mention that Brian and I be sit together in a conference room more than foot apart adhering to social distance guideline
this_quarter in the domestic irrigation business we see the resolution of various trade dispute that have be put downward pressure on farmer sentiment
the market facilitation payment administer through the USDA do significantly contribute to farm income
however commodity price do not fundamentally change give the uncertainty that exist in China 's expect commodity crop purchase
until the recent covid-19 impact we have observe a incremental improvement in customer sentiment
we continue to make progress on we innovation and collaboration strategy for fieldnet and fieldnet Advisor
year-to-date we penetration rate with we telemetry technology be up 50-plus percent versus the_prior_year
to enhance the opportunity for farmer to gain access to the Lindsay 's telemetry technology and in this case Pivot Watch Lindsay will be offer this product on Amazon later this spring
give the do-it-yourself nature of Pivot Watch this option will enhance penetration with grower who want to go online to buy the product and install it themselves
also in connection to we collaboration with Farmers Edge they recently announce they smart water offering that include access to FieldNET and FieldNET Advisor for they customer base
early indication be positive base on they customer acceptance and feedback
in the international irrigation business the global project market remain active but largely uncertain regard timing
in Brazil we continue to see growth and we have make several investment to enhance we commercial capability
for infrastructure growth in the Road Zipper business continue to gain momentum
in this past quarter we be award a contract from highway England for supply of a movable barrier system for use in Kent United Kingdom
highway England plan for the entire system and related traffic management scheme to be fully operational by December 31 , 2020
the total value of the contract as award be approximately $ 28 million
also we have secure another order from we partner in Japan Nexco East for a new reactive tension barrier to use with they exist Road Zipper system
that order value be approximately $ 10 million and we will begin delivery in we fiscal third quarter
these be great example that we be successfully address the need to grow this business and reduce the lumpiness
last quarter I share that we overall sale funnel project base on a 50_% probability of success be at the highest level it have ever be along with the number of machine be lease on target to be at the highest level ever as well
one additional point I would like to share be that we now have potential project in we sale funnel in more country than ever before
we state more than 2 year ago when we launch the Foundation for Growth initiative that for the Road Zipper business we want to increase we leasing business be active in more country and increase the overall sale
we be achieve these objective and this business be move in a positive direction
regard we Foundation for Growth initiative we continue to see that the margin improvement project we implement be deliver as expect
lastly I would like to address the impact covid-19 have on we second quarter result and the associate forward view
in we second quarter covid-19 do have a impact on product flow in some case relate to schedule shipment to and from the affect area
in addition we plant in China be temporarily shut_down align to the country mandate
at the end of the quarter this plant resume operation and be fully operational
overall the disruption in quarter be not material to we overall result
look forward we primary focus be to ensure we employee be safe and to mitigate the various risk connect to the covid-19 pandemic impact we business
to the best of we knowledge we have not have any confirm case of employee with covid-19
we proactively put a number of measure in place to promote employee safety include eliminate nonessential business travel implement return-to - work restriction for employee return from travel and evaluate whether meeting may be postpone or hold virtually
we company have move to a work-from-home direction for role that can be do at home and for role that require the employee to go to the site we have implement work restriction align to CDC and Department of Health recommendation include strict social distancing guideline that be be deploy in all we site
we business and product be generally consider business essential to support agriculture and critical infrastructure activity
so we plan will remain operational as long as we have demand for we product be allow to remain open by local government and can provide for the safety of we employee
at the present time we have temporarily cease production in we South Africa irrigation facility for 3 week due to a government mandate
however we remain open to support the service part business
in order to manage the ongoing challenge for -lsb- covid-19 -rsb- a rapid response team structure be in place across the company to address issue that arise and identify way to mitigate potential risk to the business go forward
I would like to take this opportunity to thank we employee who to continue to keep we manufacturing facility operational and allow we to deliver on we commitment to we customer
I would also like to thank we employee who be work from home support all the other function of we company
I would like now to turn the call over to Brian to review we second quarter result
thank you Tim and good morning everyone
my comment regard second quarter comparison will refer to adjust result for the_prior_year which omit the impact of Foundation for growth cost that be incur in that period
adjust result for the_prior_year be detail in the regulation g disclosure at the end of the press_release
no adjustment be make to current period result
total revenue for the_second_quarter of_fiscal be $ 113.8 million compare to $ 109.2 million in the same quarter last year
net earnings for the_quarter be $ 5.5 million or $ 0.51 per diluted share compare to net earnings of $ 200,000 or $ 0.02 per diluted share in the same quarter last year
irrigation segment revenue for the_second_quarter of_fiscal be $ 92.1 million compare to $ 95.8 million in the same quarter last year
North America irrigation revenue of $ 65.7 million increase $ 8 million or 14 % compare to $ 57.7 million in the same quarter last year
the increase result primarily from higher sale of replacement part increase irrigation equipment unit volume and higher revenue from engineering project service
average selling price for irrigation equipment be slightly higher compare to the second quarter last year
higher sale of replacement part be due to the timing of delivery under we fall restock program as we see a shift in a portion of we sale from first quarter to second quarter
in the international irrigation market revenue be $ 26.4 million compare to $ 38.1 million in the same quarter last year
the decrease result primarily from a large project sale in a develop market in the_prior_year that do not repeat
in addition approximately $ 1.1 million of the decrease result from difference in foreign currency translation rate
as previously mention current year project sale in develop market have be impact by delay in start date and be now be further impact by delivery constraint create by travel restriction as well as border closing in some country as part of effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus
total irrigation segment operating income for the_second_quarter of $ 9.6 million be $ 2.1 million higher than the_prior_year and operate margin improve to 10.4 % compare to 7.9 % in the_prior_year
operate income and margin improvement result from higher North America sale and from improve cost and pricing performance
these improvement be partially offset by the impact of incremental cost of approximately $ 1 million incur during the_quarter include severance and commercial development expense
infrastructure segment revenue for the_second_quarter of_fiscal be $ 21.7 million a increase of $ 8.3 million or 62 % compare to the same quarter last year
the increase result from higher Road Zipper system sale and lease revenue and a increase in sale of road safety product compare to the_prior_year
infrastructure segment operating income for the_second_quarter be $ 6.4 million compare to a operating loss of $ 400,000 in the_prior_year
operate margin for the_quarter be 29.3 % of sale
operate income and margin improvement result primarily from increase sale in higher-margin product line and from improve cost and pricing performance
in addition operate income for the_quarter include a gain of $ 1.2 million on the sale of a building that have be hold for sale
turn to the balance_sheet and liquidity
Lindsay be well position with a strong balance_sheet and sufficient liquidity as we face the uncertainty and challenge present by the global coronavirus pandemic
we total available liquidity at the end of the second quarter be $ 170 million with $ 120 million in cash cash equivalent and marketable security and $ 50 million available under we revolve credit facility
we total long-term debt be $ 116.5 million at the end of the second quarter and of that amount $ 115 million mature in
at the end of the quarter we be well within the financial covenant of we borrowing facility include a funded debt-to-ebitda leverage ratio of compare to a covenant limit of
at this time I would like to turn the call over to the operator to take you question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- first question come from Brian Drab William Blair
Mr. Drab be you there
be you line on mute
we will move to the next question
that come from Mr. Nathan Jones of Stifel
I guess I will start with the question on everybody 's mind and that be the impact of coronavirus
I know you guy give some update on the impact in the_second_quarter but thing have not really start to pick up at all then
we check of you yours at Lindsay yours and Valmont 's dealer network really show that the dealer be not expect domestic irrigation dealer be not expect much of a impact from coronavirus on demand
could you maybe talk a little bit about what you see in March specifically if there be a change in the demand pattern relative to what you would expect or if there be a change in the demand pattern as we go through the month
yes Nathan this be Tim and this be a important question
so let 's talk about it in a broader sense and then we will come to exactly what we be see relative to demand as a result of that
but we do move to a work-from-home direction as I have mention and then for the role that be with employee that need to go to the site we be follow the CDC and health official recommendation
the business impact that we have for second quarter we put as less than $ 1 million operating income
to you point we be on the front edge of the COVID at that point in time
currently of we manufacturing plant be still fully operational and the one in South Africa this plant be continue to support replacement part and service
now when we evaluate whether to keep a plant run we really look at key question be there be the what be the current demand level be the business classify as business essential and be the safety guideline that be in place be follow
and then that determine whether we continue to operate that plant
so in term of what we be see from a demand standpoint it speak to what you be say be overall I would describe the farm community have not feel the impact as what urban area have from a reality and also from just a concern or perception standpoint
right_now we would describe as on the ag side more concern would be the lower commodity price that be across most of the major one
and do you see any I mean I guess we will do the whole portfolio
in March do you see any deviation relative to what you would expect to see specifically from covid-19
well we would describe we demand pattern without go into forward-looking comment here Nathan as say we have be encourage by what we have see so far
okay
I guess my next question be you and everybody else be start to put practice into you facility that be likely to create inefficiency
I mean if you make people stay foot away from each other and all those kind of different thing that you put in place within those facility I would imagine that that cause some inefficiency reduce throughput increase cost to some extent I be sure it vary by different location
but maybe you could talk about the impact that those thing be have on you own operation
well first of all the type of activity that we have implement what we refer to as strict social distancing which lead to thing like redesign break room do staggered shift take staggered break those type of activity definitely that bring another level of complexity and typically complexity can bring some additional cost
but at this point in time Nathan I would not describe it as meaningful in the cost side
next question come from Mr. Brian Drab with William Blair
yes Brian
okay
so sort of building on some of the COVID concern
be there any chance that the outbreak or social distancing will affect interaction between dealer and customer
or be it I guess Tim you just mention kind of the perception and concern regard covid maybe in the more rural area where the deal be be do just it be not really hinder the interaction as much
Brian I would not say it be not have a impact on interaction because the social distancing obviously bring again I will use the word complexity a level of that to the interaction that be go_on
but I think the key here be will it impact demand and at this point in time I we do not have sign of say that if a farmer want to move forward with a purchase decision that the social distancing guideline be get in the way of that transaction occur
okay
and I be think about this and I would imagine that potentially the outbreak have more of a effect on some of the smaller grower versus some of the corporate farm like Frito-Lay et_cetera
can you comment at all about what you exposure be to the larger corporate farm whether that be a majority or minority of irrigation sale
yes
Brian this be Brian Ketcham
yes
I think we have a large part of we business that be direct towards more of you large corporate grower
I think to you point on company like a Frito-Lay it also speak to the pressure that be be put on right_now on commodity price relate to potato as a example with restaurant and school be close
I think there be some downward pressure on potato price
there be also some downward pressure on dairy
but I guess give the time of year that we be in a lot of the purchasing decision for this_year have already be make
I think the big unknown at this point be how long do the situation continue and what be the impact on commodity price as we get into next fall and post-harvest time
okay okay
and then if I could just ask question on the infrastructure side
can you give we any sense for the timing the revenue and how much will come in each quarter from this U.K. Road Zipper project
yes
so we will begin delivery probably in April pick up in May
we expectation be that we will have this in place by the end of we first quarter next year
but if you there be some variable and assumption in regard to people be able to work on the project and thing like that which at this point we feel comfortable with that situation
so I think it be if you divide that $ 28 million over a 6-month period that will give you a general flavor for how that would fall
okay
be it fair to I think I guess see if I have the_quarter right because I mean you have a May quarter right June July August
so I guess in the May quarter maybe 20_% August quarter 40 % and then the November quarter 40 %
be that a rough even in the ballpark of roughly how to think about the distribution
it be yes I think it be in the ballpark
I think the May quarter would be probably a little less than that just because of where the startup will be later in April and then into May
so you will probably look at it maybe $ 5 million or $ 6 million in the_quarter
okay
$ 5 million or $ 6 million in the May quarter do you say $ 5 million or $ 6 million
yes
yes
okay
and then last question be how excite be you about the prospects for a major infrastructure bill
how would that affect you business
so Brian we definitely believe there be the potential of that
we be monitor that closely
we do see that as a significant opportunity for we business
so there be a level of excitement here of what potential that could bring
next call be from Ryan Connors of Boenning and Scattergood
guy I want to just probe a little deeper on the issue of commodity price
I mean I appreciate the optimism and the idea that maybe this could be just a transitory impact
but I know the USDA 's be out there with some pretty aggressive forecast on plant acreage for corn
as you allude to Tim a lot of those decision be make before this all come out and they be say that restaurant demand be down in term of food and so forth
so you can paint a pretty dire picture as we get into the fall if the weather cooperate and this be less than transitory on the demand side you can paint a pretty dire picture of what commodity could look like 12 month down the road
so I guess I would frame it this way
I mean you talk about Foundation for growth and you margin target and that sort of thing
when you lay that out you kind of say look that be with no help from the cycle which be appropriate to manage the business independent of that
but if we have how do you frame those the Foundation for Growth the margin target et_cetera in light of what could be not only a lack of help from the cycle but some damage so to speak from the cycle
yes
Ryan this be Tim
we be go to continue with what we say at the very begin as we be go to expectation and commitment that we could deliver 11 % to 12 % in a market similar to
to you point commodity price have definitely see downward pressure with what we be see in the near term here
have say that we feel very good about what we be deliver on Foundation for growth
we be quite open about say that we be deliver on the project that we lay out
example to highlight be in Road Zipper and the shift-left strategy
we feel excellent about what be happen
so we be go to stay with the position that we lay out a couple of year ago but bring proof point of how we be do along the way
and one of the thing that you continue to hear we focus on be what we be do on the shift-left strategy
we think this be really add a lot of value to the company
get it
okay
and then one more more specifically as it relate to Foundation for Growth initiative and just restructure the business in general
I mean I guess one of the benefit of have go through that be that you enter a rougher patch maybe with a leaner shop
but I guess the flip side of that be maybe there be fewer lever to pull go forward
so if we look at some of the fixed line and the model like G&A and thing like that I mean have be there room there to make more move if you have to if the market head south
or do you risk kind of cut into bone there
these product -lsb- continue -rsb- in what be I find very positive about we Foundation for growth
it have not other one come forward
so this start to become part of the culture
but Ryan another thing I want to highlight and I think that this be really critical as we put behavior in place into we company 2 year ago and as -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- in this new environment those new behavior be really help we manage the business in this rapidly change environment
and it have help we a lot in how we have communicate and how we have structure what we call we response management on that
so in total we believe Foundation for Growth have help we in this environment
and I would not say that we be wrong because we be continue to find new price to put into we funnel go forward
next question be from Joseph Mondillo Sidoti & Company
I be wonder I just sort of want to ask another question sort of related to commodity price just maybe in a different way
how much do you guy anticipate such as like corn demand there to be affect by this downturn
I know ethanol be a big component of corn consumption and then obviously there be the food aspect of demand
and relative to what you just post in the North America part of the irrigation segment which be better than I be look for how much be that sort of just totally in the_past and really it look good that thing be trend in the positive but thing have change so much since the February quarter
could you maybe frame you answer sort of with that kind of a context
yes
Joe you ask on corn so specifically address that crop
right_now USDA lay it past would say that we be go to have the most plant acre on corn since ' 20
so there be definitely a large interest gravitate towards that crop
a downward pressure on the corn be clearly ethanol
on the other side be the phase 1 China trade deal
we have to -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- this be from China on corn which be help there
there be some optimism could that thing could phase also include ethanol
so key that be a key question here be lift will come from the China phase 1 trade deal
but definitely there be downward pressure across the board on the key commodity crop
all right
and then I guess I should ask since no one do I do not think it be probably go to be overly significant but the south african plant closure how significant be that to you overall business
today we be work with the assumption that it will be a 3-week temporary closing
and with that assumption Joe we would not call it meaningful with assume that continue to play as we have describe here
all right
and a couple of question on the infrastructure segment
first off that Japan Road Zipper $ 10 million delivery that you be expect in the_third_quarter be that in the backlog
and then can you talk about how just the overall infrastructure segment sort of outlook be in a scenario of a severe just overall recession what the challenge be how effective that business would be or not be just to give we
Great Joe
yes this be Brian
both the U.K. project and the $ 10 million Japan order be add to infrastructure business what we be be tell be and especially with these project they be definitely high priority for Japan and they expect to continue to go forward in spite of the coronavirus situation
when you look at the U.S. and the dot that we have talk to they do they planning on a multiyear horizon
so they want to continue to move forward with the project that they have get plan this_year
if not it cause a significant disruption in they entire planning process
so what we be be tell today be the project that we have get plan and be look at for this_year be go to continue to go forward
all right
and then one last question
just in term of the actually question
first off capex be a little light in the_second_quarter
be you still expect that $ 15 million to $ 20 million like you be originally anticipate
and then number two on the balance_sheet just give the strength of the balance_sheet I probably would assume that you be go to be a little conservative in the near term but just sort of more think about long term with Foundation for Growth largely complete how be you think about sort of utilize the balance_sheet
be acquisition part of you strategy go forward
or just could you give we a update on that for sort of long-term strategy with the balance_sheet
yes
First of all in regard to CapEx yes through the first 6 month we have only spend about $ 5.3 million
we still and the reason for that be a little bit lower than expectation be that some of that capex activity be plan to build barrier and machine for the Road Zipper lease fleet
and that spending be temporarily divert to build up inventory to supply the U.K. project as well as the Japan project
but in the second half of the_year we be still expect we will spend between $ 10 million and $ 15 million in the second half which will get we into that $ 15 million to $ 20 million range for the_year
just in general regard to capital allocation I would say the priority remain the same
I think right_now give the current uncertain environment liquidity and capital preservation be important
we at this point would continue to probably be in a little bit of a holding pattern when it come to share repurchase
in term of acquisition we continue to have a number of discussion with potential target
I think one thing we be see in that regard too be a little bit of a wait-and-see situation with some seller right_now
next question be from Jon Braatz Kansas City Capital
on the international irrigation side of the business obviously the covid-19 impact really begin have a bigger impact I should say in March and in April
when you look at the international irrigation business would you expect to see added pressure to that piece of the business and maybe even a more difficult second half than what we see in the first half
Jon the area in the international business that I would highlight to address that part of the question be the Middle East
we have start to ship a large project order into that market and that order have be put on hold due to border closure which be tie to covid-19
we do expect the shipment to continue into late q3 and into q4 but that be assume the border crossing be allow
we see sign of good project demand that will be tender later this year but not likely for fiscal year '20 delivery
that be where I would describe the biggest impact of covid-19 at this point in time
the other area I would highlight be South Africa
give the fact that we plant be temporarily cease production that be due to a overall country mandate
so that be one area where we do activity will be slow also due to this
okay
Brian one question
on the income statement there be $ 1 million other expense item in the_quarter
what be that
yes Jon
in the it be in the irrigation and the primary driver there be there be some severance cost both in the U.S. and in the international business due to workforce reduction
there be also commercial development activity in the U.S. some marketing initiative around we technology product and then in Brazil with some of the dealer development expense with new dealer that be add during the_quarter
okay
okay
be the workforce at the level that you would like it to be
or would we see would you anticipate any other workforce reduction
yes and I would describe that at this point in time we feel good about where we be at but we be still there be always a continuous improvement mentality
so I be not go to say there will not be change
but at this point we feel good about where we be at recognize that there be more unknown in this environment go forward due to covid-19
next question come from Chris Shaw of Monness Crespi
if I could ask on the irrigation I guess sort of more broadly if you go back and historically you guy be very tie to corn price it seem like go back a decade or so
I be just wonder give that the when you have give the percentage of new irrigation system versus part and all that more recently that be really go down in term of new irrigation system
so just look now be the correlation between lower percent at this point and it be mostly replacement part or other kind of irrigation maybe for other crop
and then actually be corn that big be that really be that shrink as a actual end market for you
yes
Chris this be Brian
well to you first question I mean just in the most recent quarter new dry land irrigation or new irrigation for the first time be actually at 34 % of the total sale
so it still remain within that range that we have talk about in the_past of in dry land conversion replacement but we do see different part of the country where there be still new development go_on in the U.S. to you question on corn I think we definitely there be a strong corn drive a lot of irrigation but there be other market what we have talk about potato market dairy market other different type of crop in the Southeast and other area but corn 's still definitely a driver of the overall business
do you have a percentage of what the corn end market be for you overall irrigation sale in the U.S. at all
or
no
we really do not
and part of the reason be even with potato and some of the other crop corn be still a rotational crop
so it be still important in some of those market as well
we do not it be not really clearly define
right that make sense
and then just quickly on infrastructure
the U.K. project and Japan project be both those be both sale
there be no leasing involvement in either of those be there
that be correct yes
both sale
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question be a follow-up from Nathan Jones of Stifel
just have a follow-up question on the part sale during the_quarter
if I recall correctly there be a absence of part sale in the first half of calendar with all the flooding that go on last_year
and the anticipation be that some of it will be catch up last_year and some of it would be catch up this_year
so can you comment on be this a more normal level of part sale that you see this_year versus last_year
or be we at a elevated level of part sale catch up from some of the damage that be do in the flooding last_year
yes Nathan this be Brian
the part sale in we first and second quarter be generally go to be more drive by the restock program that we put in place post harvest
and as you recall in we first quarter we be down in part sale year-over-year and we attribute that to timing of the delivery this_year
and so we see that happen in we second quarter
so I would say overall year-to-date we part sale be fairly similar to where we be a year ago
I think the flood impact be we be probably in that period of time now when these flood really start to impact and then into the summer when some of those machine never some of the farmer do not plant and so the machine do not run last_year
but so far year-to-date I would say we be on par with where we be a year ago
okay
so potentially some year-over-year increase in part sale over the next couple of quarter
just one more
on the infrastructure business the Road Zipper business you talk about have a funnel that be bigger than it have ever be last quarter and clearly convert a couple of big order this_quarter
so I be sure it be smaller than it be a quarter ago
but can you talk about the pipeline of opportunity how mature those thing be how much more cultivate they need and when you would think you might be able to turn some of those into more order
yes
Nathan this be Tim
without give number what I will describe that have be a part of the Foundation for growth
we have get a lot more I will describe it as a sophisticated sale funnel at different stage and we be track how long it take to move to each age
what we be really excite about be that we be get a higher percentage of we business as we continue to go forward into this shift-left category and that be bring a additional opportunity for demand that we have not have before
so not only be you see better result immediate in term of the sale that we be get but we be able to look back several year that we be able to look forward I should say several year into the_future here and we see good activity and then we be track each of those stage how long it take for those project to move forward
so that be why I be able to say that we have the best sale funnel that we have ever have at this point in time
it be not just because of the near term
it be in total
at this time there appear to be no more question

Gus
thank you Mike
and thank you all for join we
at the conclusion of we call in February none of we could have imagine how we world be go to change in just a few short month
on the call this_morning we will provide detail of we performance for the_first_quarter as usual but we also spend some time in we comment discuss item which believe will be of interest to you in the wake of the covid-19_pandemic
before we turn to the result for this_quarter I would like to welcome Dave Colo to the call this_morning as we recently appoint President and Chief Operating Officer
follow my retirement in May Dave will assume the role of CEO
I feel very fortunate to have have the opportunity to lead such a talented passionate and collaborative organization
I also appreciate the strong ongoing support of we Board
I have work closely with Dave since he join the Board in and I be confident he will be a terrific successor in lead mgp
as a director on we Board Dave play a critical role in support the company 's growth over the past several year and we be very excite to have he on the executive leadership team
now I will turn to the result for the_first_quarter
we be very pleased with the result this_quarter with consolidated sale increase 11.2 % and gross profit increase 39.3 %
these result reflect strong customer demand in both business segment and improve effectiveness in we tactical execution
we result for this_quarter reflect growth in premium beverage brown goods sale as well as significant year over-year increase in sale of we specialty wheat starch and protein
look at each segment individually in we distillery product segment sale finish the quarter up 7.3 % to $ 80 million while gross profit increase to $ 18.2 million or 22.8 % of segment sale
these result reflect a basis point increase in gross profit margin as compare to the prior year period
sale of premium beverage alcohol be up 9.4 % for the_quarter
these improve result be primarily drive by a double-digit growth in both sale of new distillate and aged whisky which lead to a 17.1 % increase in sale of brown goods
we see strong demand for we inventory of aged whiskey include sale of whiskey from we and vintage
sale of aged whiskey reflect lower pricing versus the prior year quarter but in line with we expectation
despite some significant change dynamics at the retail level and potential challenge to specific customer we believe the underlie macro consumer trend support the ongoing growth of the american whiskey category remain strong
the stay-at-home order have have a devastating impact on on-premise sale over the past six week while consumer appear to be increase they consumption at home drive record increase in off premise sale during the period
while channel specific trend go forward be uncertain the category trend seem to be hold strong with american whiskey continue to be one of the top growth category
while sale of premium beverage white goods be down 1.6 % for the_quarter margin improve due to lower input cost
while continue to implement we broader growth plan we be also focus on help we industrial alcohol customer navigate the challenge they be confront with as a result of the covid-19_pandemic
we remain committed to continue the legacy we company be found on more than 75 year ago by support the relief effort with both financial aid and increase production of alcohol for hand sanitizer and commercial disinfectant need
mgp be uniquely position to serve as the backbone of the increase industrial alcohol production in this country and we be proud to expand we effort at we Kansas and Indiana facility during this critical time
sale of industrial alcohol increase for the_quarter by 5.7 %
as a reminder to those new to the story we typically run we alcohol production close to full capacity to optimize the cost structure of we facility
while we have experience increase demand related to covid-19 over the past several week it be important to point out that a significant portion of we industrial alcohol and premium beverage white goods production be already contract for a set price last fall
improve demand for industrial alcohol have come into play in the near term but we do not view this pandemic as a opportunity to maximize short-term financial result on this product line
also of note sale of dry distiller grain or ddg experience a decline of 1.5 % as compare to the first quarter of 2019
this be due to a slight decrease in sale volume partially offset by favorable average selling price
revenue from warehouse service increase by 10.5 % reflect in part the growth in the number of customer barrel age in we whiskey warehouse and other service we provide
turn to ingredient Solutions
sale grow 31.4 % to $ 19.1 million
Gross profit increase to $ 5 million or 26 % of segment sale reflect a significant increase in gross profit margin as compare to the prior year period
we Ingredient Solutions post its fourteenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year business over the past several year and we be encourage by the robust gross margin we be able to achieve this_quarter
the majority of this increase be due to we ability to optimize sale in production toward we highest margin product
we also benefit from decrease input cost in the absence of flood related cost
Specialty wheat starch sale grow 48.4 % this_quarter while we specialty wheat protein sale grow 43.3 % both drive by increase volume and favorable average selling price
we believe we specialty starch portfolio particularly we line of fiber product and we recently rebrand ProTerra line of textured protein continue to be align with strong consumer trend
while the covid-19 pandemic continue to create a period of uncertainty and potential challenge we remain committed to take the measure necessary to help ensure the safety and well be of we employee
we begin we response to the pandemic by mobilize a Central Crisis Response Team which have be up and run since mid-March
this broad-ranging team include member from operation hr legal it finance and we executive team which meet on a weekly basis
we also create a specialize subgroup of this team which meet daily
this subgroup be establish to manage proactive and responsive action across we operation
we have direct engagement with all area of the organization on a daily basis and have enact centralized protocol for respond to operational issue as they develop
we be proud of the aggressive action put in place to safeguard we employee while they perform they essential work
we continue to look to the CDC who and state and local health department for guidance as we move forward at each of we facility and office
this conclude my remark
let I now turn thing over to Brandon Gall for a review of the key metric and number
Brandon
thanks Gus
for the_quarter consolidated sale increase 11.2 % to $ 99.1 million reflect a 7.3 % increase in the distillery product segment and a 31.4 % increase in the Ingredient Solutions segment
Consolidated gross profit increase 39.3 % to $ 23.2 million due to increase gross profit in both the distillery product and Ingredient Solutions segment
Consolidated gross margin increase by basis_point to 23.4 % of sale up from 18.7 % in the prior year quarter
corporate selling general and administrative expense total $ 9.5 million for the first quarter 2020 represent a increase of 16.6 % compare to the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to increase incentive compensation expense inclusive of certain incremental cost incur relate to the transition at the CEO position
Consolidated operate income increase 61 % to $ 13.7 million due to increase gross profit in both the distillery product and Ingredient Solutions segment partially offset by increase corporate selling general and administrative expense
non-gaap operating income increase 67.9 % to $ 14.3 million exclusive of CEO transition cost
we corporate effective tax rate be 24.7 % in the current quarter compare to a tax benefit of 17.7 % in the prior year quarter that result from a sizable vesting of share-based award
Consolidated net income for the_quarter increase slightly to $ 9.8 million while earnings per share remain flat from the prior year period at $ 0.57 per share
ep be affect by improve operating result and partially offset by a prior year period tax benefit result from the vested share-based award
mgp 's balance_sheet and access to capital remain strong
we remain well capitalized and throw down additional fund on we revolve credit facility during the_quarter to maintain a conservative cash position and have sufficient liquidity in the event the pandemic directly impact operation
as such we end the_quarter with a debt balance of $ 96.1 million and a cash balance of $ 42.7 million
as of March 31 , 2020 approximately $ 245 million remain available under the $ 300 million revolving credit line
we leverage continue to be very low and give we have not experience any significant economic hardship on we business to date as a result covid-19 we have not participate in any of the lending program provide by the CARES Act
first quarter 2020 cash flow provide by operation be $ 0.5 million compare to a use of cash of approximately $ 3.8 million in the prior year quarter a improvement of $ 4.3 million
Accounts receivable and day sale outstanding increase $ 11.5 million at seven and a half day during the_quarter respectively
this increase be consistent with the development of longer sale history with craft customer new relationship with export customer and new long-term supply agreement with large customer all of which we have discuss on this call in previous quarter
customer we extend credit to be mostly large in nature and all have a combination of strong balance_sheet and long payment history with mgp
as a result we be not experience issue with collection
Historically first quarter operate cash flow have not be indicative of the whole year
during the period we also invest a net $ 7.2 million for grow we barrel distillate inventory for aging
as a reminder to those that might be new on the call today while we do reduce we annual volume growth expectation for aged whiskey on we call last February we believe we library of various mash bill and vintage will continue to contribute significant level of profit for the company go forward
we also believe we inventory set aside for aged whiskey sale in the U.S. market be close to reach equilibrium on a net basis and any future inventory increase will be for export sale new mash bill and to support the growth of we own brand
past or even recent quarter be not necessarily indicative of barrel distillate investment in subsequent quarter
fluctuation in we quarterly investment can be impact by a number of factor include customer demand for new distillate production efficiency mix capacity warehouse capacity and sale of aged whiskey
we warehouse expansion program have be another important initiative to support new distillate demand for we customer as well as we investment in age inventory
as of March 31 , 2020 we spend approximately $ 49.7 million of $ 49.8 million we project as a total investment
the program remain on track to be complete later this year
during the_quarter we purchase share in the open market as part of a $ 25 million common stock repurchase program announce in February of 2019
we repurchase share for approximately $ 4.1 million for a weighted average all-in cost per share of $ 25.47 during the first quarter of 2020 and we conclude we purchase on March 16
recently the Board authorize a second quarter dividend in the amount of $ 0.12 per share
the Board continue to view dividend as a important way to share the success of the company with shareholder
let I now turn thing over to Dave Colo for conclude remark
thanks Brandon
now I would like to touch on some additional initiative that support we long-term strategic plan but first address we outlook for the balance of the_year
while we be off to a strong start to the_year with ample access to capital and encouraging customer demand we financial result for the balance of the_year could be impact by the covid-19 virus
give the uncertainty this pandemic have cause for nearly every industry across the world it be impossible to predict with any level of precision the pandemic 's cumulative impact on we future financial result
for these reason we be withdraw we previous guidance and we will reassess this position base on the visibility of the macroeconomic recovery
we balance_sheet and access to capital continue to be strong while we seek to optimize cash management during this pandemic
although we long-term capital allocation strategy may experience little change we seek to maintain a conservative cash position as outline by Brandon earlier
by renew we credit facility and expand we borrowing capacity earlier this year we have enhance we access to capital with attractive pricing and term
as we navigate the effect of this pandemic we will remain focus on prudent capital management which be why we have elect to curtail stock repurchase while maintain we quarterly dividend
the management team in close collaboration with the board have the ability to initiate the buyback program or adjust quarterly dividend as circumstance warrant
the american whiskey category continue to experience strong growth and we will continue to invest to support that growth
the demand and pricing in line with we expectation demonstrate the health of this and scale advantage and plan to increase we focus toward grow volume share in the global american whiskey category
we do not believe this equate to significant change to overall pricing but rather refinement to how we approach the selling process the product we offer and the market we focus on
we objective go forward will be to optimize we brown goods profit by increase volume share at market-based pricing
although we believe the american whiskey category trend be long-term in nature we have identify a handful of potential headwind for the balance of the_year as a result of the pandemic
while we do not experience any significant impact from these potential headwind during the_quarter we want to proactively share what we be see across the industry
the first relate to the potential pantry load that may have be occur over the past several week cause off-premise sale to significantly spike
we be unsure how long these purchase behavior will continue and what potential impact they might have on future off-premise sale when stay-at-home order be lift across the nation
second the stay-at-home order and closure of bar restaurant and tasting room be have a immediate impact on we craf customer sale the past several week
we would anticipate these trend to reverse as these establishment reopen
but it be difficult to predict when that might occur in a meaningful way
the third potential headwind be relate to we multinational customer
while most have strong balance_sheet and access to capital it be unclear how they conservation of cash may impact we brown goods sale throughout the balance of the_year
the last potential headwind we have identify be we near-term ability to grow international sale and export we distilled spirit overseas
in the_first_quarter we begin to experience meaningful progress against we ability to expand we international sale
we continue to believe that we investment to expand international sale will provide long-term shareholder value
however as travel have be curtail and tariff in key international market persist we ability to further develop this opportunity have be delay
we continue to closely monitor each of these potential headwind and will provide additional update as they become available
we warehouse expansion project be substantially complete allow we to increase we storage capacity to meet the grow demand for we new distillate
we anticipate the conclusion of this project to occur in the_second_quarter
as Brandon mention we also invest a additional $ 7.2 million in we aging whiskey inventory
this bring we inventory of age whiskey to $ 111.4 million at cost
the positive brown goods result this_quarter continue to demonstrate the long-term value of we aged whiskey inventory
while we focus in the Distillery Products segment will always be supply other brand owner with premium distil spirit we continue to progress we brand initiative with the acquisition of new Columbia distiller base in Washington D.C. we be thrill to add the Greenhouse Gin brand to we award-winning portfolio this acquisition enhance the depth of expertise and commitment to the category we have develop over the_year
we continue to develop we exist market focus on increase retail distribution and velocity per point of distribution for we portfolio brand
although the current environment be not generally conducive to m&a activity we will continue to assess opportunity to strengthen we position in grow market in concert with we financial position in the upcoming quarter
we pandemic response plan which be design to accommodate evolve information and guidance provide by government agency and health official focus on protect we employee and customer and do we part to help stop the spread of the virus
the Central Crisis Response Team and specialize subgroup gus mention earlier have help to ensure the safety of we employee as well as to comply with various government restriction for stay-at-home order
as direct by these two team we will continue to implement social distancing at each of we facility and office pay hourly wage bonus to we production employee cross-train team member to ensure coverage for critical position provide health screening and monitor for we employee as well as extend we sick leave policy restrict travel across the organization implement work-from-home policy where we be able and lastly we will continue to have a weekly risk assessment of we supply_chain which include a daily monitoring of we contractor transport partner input producer and all other supplier and vendor to mitigate any potential disruption to we supply_chain
before we conclude we prepared remark and begin the question-and-answer portion of the call I would like to express my gratitude to Gus for he success in lead the company
since join in Gus be able to focus the entire organization on a clear strategy lead its successful implementation and very importantly help restore mgp 's special culture
we be well-positioned for the next chapter in we story and we sincerely thank Gus for he year of dedicated service to mgp and the lasting contribution he have make to the company
the aggressive implementation of we strategic plan put in place by Gus over the past several year have position mgp for sustainable long-term growth
Management team will be focus on continually refine the effectiveness of we tactical execution accelerate the pace of we strategic implementation and leverage the strong foundation we have build for growth in and beyond
we remain confident that focus on we key strategy will drive superior long-term shareholder value move forward
operator we be now ready to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call
we will now begin the question-and-answer session
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- the first question come from Ben Klieve of National Securities Corporation
please go ahead
all right thanks for take my question
first a couple of question on the ingredient side
I be wonder first of all if you could kind of break into the growth number that you see in the_first_quarter
to what degree be there any lumpy one-time sale in there or maybe accelerate buying at the end of the quarter in advance of anticipated volume from consumer goods company
how can we look at the result from that quarter in that segment in the context of the covid-19 era
hi Ben , it be Dave
I will take that
so I think as you hear on the call we ingredient business have continue to demonstrate good growth
I think it be primarily drive by the fact that we have a well positioned portfolio both on the wheat protein and the wheat starch side
I think what you be see be kind of a continuation of strong consumer demand as consumer continue to migrate to a healthier diet and with we plant-based protein in the Ingredient sector we really do not see any anomaly if you will in q1 in that business
I think we be just see good strong underlying consumer trend with a well-positioned portfolio to support those trend
Got it
that be great
then stick to that segment to what degree do you see the consumer goods company adjust they r&d process in the area of social distancing
I mean be you see delay be you see complete shutdown from that process or be that continue relatively uninterrupted
what be you guy see on you end
yeah I mean for the most part relative to the ingredient it be relatively be uninterrupted at this point
although we be see some impact in the Foodservice channel primarily relate to customer that serve
if you think about sport event stadium entertainment venue of that nature and the product they produce to support those venue we have see a slight slowdown in some of those product line
but for be on trend and in great demand even during this pandemic
get it
Perfect
turn over to the distillery segment you comment a couple of time on the improvement from the export market
I be wonder if you can comment on a couple of thing there
First of all to what degree do you see kind of a broad macro improvement in the export market versus maybe just kind of uniquely strong execution from you team
yes I think we be that kind of a new part of the organization for we try to penetrate export sale and we comment be relative to the fact that we start to see some pretty good traction with customer interest and engagement during the first half of the quarter
the last half of the quarter have be impact by covid-19 in the fact that substantially all travel have be shut_down
so it be be difficult to continue the engagement with the customer
it require travel primarily into the US or we team to go international but the comment be really specific to the work that have be do to date start by pay some dividend in q1 but we do see that be delay until the pandemic clear and we be able to get back more active engagement with we customer
get it
last one from I and then I will get back in queue
do you comment on you may be hit the pause button if you will on pursuit of m&a activity which certainly be understandable in the current environment
my question around that be to what degree do you look at the m&a market right_now especially on the branded spirit side and see a meaningful decrease in valuation or be it too early to know that yet
I mean what be you see in that space right_now as the world have evolve over the last 6 week
yeah I think there have be a significant slowdown in m&a activity globally if you see and if you be look at spirit brand of we company it be a interesting thing with the COVID impact and with the off-premise sale spike I be sure some company can view that actually as a opportunity to position themselves from a increase valuation perspective
so I think we need to let this pandemic play out to really understand the impact on m&a activity and how it will or will not affect valuation of company
this be Brandan
just to add to that for a second I think to be clear and clarify we put a pause or curtail the share repurchase program during q1
we comment be on M&A or be that we be necessarily pause they at this point in time but we do say be that we acknowledge that this environment be not generally conducive to M&A as Dave just mention but that we will continue to assess opportunity to strengthen we position in grow market in concert with we financial position in the upcoming quarter
get it
okay
thanks Brandan
very good
I think that do it for I
thanks for take my question and I will get back in queue
here we next question come from Bill Chappell of SunTrust
please go ahead
thanks good morning
I be go to ask probably more than and less than question
let 's start with the aged inventory
there be more color around the sale this_quarter
be there a postponement from fourth quarter to this_quarter
you talk about lower pricing year-over-year
be that part of the plan to have lower than 3 time pricing and then maybe be this a start of thing to come
do you feel like we be now get the process move forward where you have more regular sale of age
thanks Bill
it be Dave
I think part of the sale we see in q1 be some carry-over that we expect in q4
for the price in question we have a very strong pricing quarter that we be site over a year ago but we pricing this_quarter be still in line with we for aged
as we go forward as I comment in the prepared remark we approach with aged with brown goods in general be that we want to make sure that we be in a position to grow we volume share and do that the market-based pricing so that the end result be we maximize or optimize excuse I we profit in we brown goods sector
so I think you will see we continue to talk in those term and make sure that we be in a position where we be optimize the profitability of the inventory that we have
so just to make sure I understand I mean do you you can make another probability of sell it above cost
that be all I be just try to understand
do you think that aged there be steady demand as we go through this_year the price you be talk about
yeah I think we pricing in q1 be certainly in line with the historical way we talk about it 3x if you will
and we do see continued demand for both new distillate and aged whiskey go forward
I think what we be say be we just want to make sure as we go forward that we be optimize the profitability of the entire portfolio and not so focus on 3x per se but make sure we be in line with market-based pricing as we move forward
okay
and then just last one on the whiskey
I mean I know there have be some talking -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- demand for the age
yeah I think it be if you look at Europe Asia etcetera I think there be still demand
it be be put on pause with the account that we have be pursue simply because of the pandemic
as this pass and we understand more the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic that will help we in line of sight to those if the potential still exist which we believe it will and how quickly we can restore discussion with international customer
okay
and then switch to industrial alcohol
I mean can you just give we some more color on how that business work how it work in the_quarter
when I say that the question I get be you make ethyl alcohol we hear of ethanol player or Exxon or other kind of move into this
and at the same point you be say you be uniquely position within the market
you be obviously expand operation in Indiana as well as Kansas to meet the demand
I understand when Gus say we be not look for near term financial gain you be not look to price gouge
but at the same point it would seem it be pretty dramatic change to that business over the next few month so more color on both how you be uniquely position how it work in term of kind of pricing and demand and new customer and stuff like that
a tutorial would be helpful
sure
so I think you know I think when Gus make the comment we be uniquely position we have be in industrial alcohol marketer and producer for a long long time
it be really kind of the foundation of the company in its beginning and we know the market we know the industry extremely well
the way traditionally it work we contract the majority of we volume in the fall for the come calendar year we fiscal year if you will
and then there be some volume that be leave it be sell on the spot market but the majority of it be contract
so we any pricing spike that you would have anticipate as a result of this increase demand in q1 from the pandemic we already have the majority of that volume price if you will
I think go forward what we have historically say be the margin in industrial alcohol be very slim and there be a structural issue in the category
and what I mean by that be there be a lot of ethanol
there be oversupply of ethanol in the country right_now that be be ongoing probably for the last two to three year
there have be a oversupply of industrial alcohol as well
and something structurally there would have to change before margin can be restore and either industrial or ethanol for that matter
what be go_on right_now in the with oil price so low and nobody be drive anywhere because of the pandemic the demand for ethanol be really be impact negatively
so there be a number of ethanol facility that be close
what we always watch out for in that environment be make sure we understanding if some of that ethanol capacity get convert into industrial alcohol capacity
it require a capital investment to do that but that there be certainly nothing stop they from do that other than the sheer economics of it
so I guess what I be try to say be that there be a short-term blip in demand for industrial due to the pandemic
we be go to watch closely to see post-pandemic if the usage of industrial increase because of change in behavior
obviously people more sensitive to virus et_cetera that could drive consumer behavior change that could increase demand for industrial
but at this point though I think it be too early to tell how this be go to play_out long-term
so just try to understand with the contract of and I understand long term over the next few year but I be just try to understand with the way it be contract out do that mean when would you start to see the benefit of the near-term spike demand be that this_quarter or be that next quarter or be that at all
be you kind of try to step away from this and not try to build up too much
yeah I mean we be on we Industrial complex if you will pretty much at capacity
so I think what we have try to do to support we customer as they need have increase during the_first_quarter here be we have try to optimize that output as much as we can
so we start the_quarter call it the first two third of the_quarter and we really do not see a impact from the pandemic
it be really the last third of the_quarter where we start see increase demand for industrial to make hand sanitizer
we do as much as we could to put as much volume through we Industrial complex if you will to meet customer need
but as far if this be go to continue we think that we be continue to see strong demand as we sit here today
it be hard to predict how long that be go to continue
from a pricing perspective any spot purchase that occur for the next few month there may be a benefit in pricing just because of the demand but in the near term I think we do anticipate see increase demand
the impact of that on pricing as I say earlier -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- of we volume 's contract so we be not go to see a real benefit from that and there be potential for the spot market pricing to increase
get it
and so last on this be you add new customer or be it just you be just try to understand
be you just basically say we be go to support we exist customer at pretty similar price and any excess capacity be just go to go to they and so it be a level kind of increase or improvement over the next few month or you look at outset new customer
yeah
we have long-standing customer relationship so obviously we be take care of they first and include try to support the additional need they have
in scenario like this obviously new customer opportunity exist because people start call you versus you have to call they so we also be evaluate new customer
but we will continue that process as we go forward
get it
so one last question
remind I just on uniquely position what do you right_now what you be do differently versus just ethanol player
yeah
Bill , this be Brandon
and so by uniquely position go back to Dave 's earlier comment that we have be do this a long time
and we already have a standing customer base that be design to as efficiently and quickly as possible get this type of product out to the market where it be need the most and that be where we have be and that be where we have be for more than 75 year
and have those relationship with those exist customer put we in the unique position to really help respond to this pandemic in the most efficient way possible
just to give you a example on that Bill so one of we industrial customer for example be produce more than a million bottle of hand sanitizer per day for the response
mgp supplies a majority of the alcohol of that customer
so just by go through we exist network we be able to uniquely add value and to the overall effort in response to the pandemic
get it
thanks so much
thank you
thank you
the next question come from Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum
please go ahead
Great thanks very much for take my question
I think it be interesting the acquisition that you make during the_quarter
can you talk a little bit more about the thought that go into that and what kind of a opportunity that could be to expand you gin business
and then just think more broadly about you portfolio of brand obviously a small part of you business right_now can you talk about how the current environment have impact you expansion plan for you brand
and do that do this change the execution of you branded strategy at all
yeah
Alex , this be Brandon and I will take a start at that
so yeah we be very excite for the acquisition of Green Hat Gin
it be currently as you know located or sell in the Maryland DC and Virginia and we a premium super-premium very well-positioned brand to we portfolio
it be a effort that I think you probably know we have be talk about potentially add a gin for some time now and we be very happy to see it come to fruition
in term of we overall effort in the branded space like everybody else we be not immune to a lot of the challenge that be out there it be very difficult to launch new market or to put a whole lot of new effort in when you can not do live tasting and you can not visit retailer and distributor and so on
so like a lot of we peer what we be do be we be do a lot of thing virtually
we be try to really keep we social media presence very prominent with we consumer and really try to focus in on that effort until thing normalize
that be really helpful
thank you and wish you all the best at mgp and Gus wish you well in the next chapter of you life here
thanks Alex. I appreciate it

I will now turn the call over to Erik
thank you John
good morning everybody and thank you for join we today during these unprecedented time
let I begin by express my best wish to you and to you family to stay safe and healthy
covid-19 be no doubt top of mind for all of we right_now
so before we get into the_quarter let I start by share with you a overview of how we be deal with this issue
we have launch a company-wide business continuity effort to help we navigate the business through this period of uncertainty
as you can imagine this be get we leadership team 's full attention right_now and we be in constant communication with we stakeholder we associate we customer we supplier as we contingency plan for what be likely to be a extended disruption to the economy
we # 1 priority be the health and safety of we associate and they family we customer and we other partner
so those associate who can do so be work from home particularly in we corporate function
as we be a essential business we be continue to operate we customer fulfillment center or distribution center
so those associate continue to be on-premises serve we customer
this be particularly important because with timely shipping and some creative source we be help to keep the nation 's front line run while we all battle this outbreak
we have institute enhance safety procedure to safeguard the health and safety of we team include the use of additional protective equipment and frequent cleaning of we facility
give that we be provide essential service to many organization on the front line of the response to covid-19 we do not have any plan at this time to shut_down we customer fulfillment center
however we will of course follow the guidance of health official and we be in close contact with they across we operating footprint
we have eliminate essentially all travel in order to ensure health and safety
we be also reduce spend more broadly across the company only move ahead on operating and capital spending that be deem critical
we have cease all hiring cut expense on item like outside resource include consulting and more
look ahead we have well-developed contingency plan to reduce cost further if the situation deteriorate from here as it very well may
I be proud of how we associate have step up during this time of unprecedented uncertainty
we warehouse associate continue get product out the door every day
we sale and service team remain the face of the company on the front line with we customer
we category management team be come up with miracle to find scarce safety and janitorial product that be keep we customer go
and we it team have move in work speed to enable nearly the entire company with remote access
we will share some more detail on we action later in the call but I will now turn to we fiscal second quarter that we close at the end of February
during the_quarter we continue to progress on we journey to reposition MSC as a mission-critical partner on the plant floor of manufacturing and industrial customer
we remain focus on the initiative that we have discuss over the last couple of call to restore operate margin stability and ultimately expansion
and those be refining the sale effectiveness plan improve the profitability of we supplier program and improve productivity by reduce operating_expense
first we continue refine the sale force and prepare to accelerate growth
sale headcount be roughly flat during we fiscal second quarter
importantly though we increase headcount in the growth area such as business development or the hunter role that we have talk about into ccsg and a couple of other investment priority
we new business win continue at a strong pace and remain on plan
while encouraging we realize that the ultimate measure will be we growth gap above market
we second initiative be improve the profitability of we supplier program
recall that we have negotiate roughly $ 20 million in annualize profit improvement split about equally between the back half of we fiscal and we fiscal
the overall program remain on track
we do expect however that covid-19 and the result economic ripple could mute some of the benefit in the near-term as purchase level and hence rebate payout come down
the third fiscal initiative be realign we operating model to reduce expense and improve productivity
you will recall that some of this begin at the end of we fiscal with offering voluntary early retirement to some associate and ratchet we performance management intensity for other
we also selectively eliminate position where we focus be change
all of that continue into we fiscal second quarter and we begin selectively hire in certain customer face role as I mention
we also continue we assessment of additional opportunity to align we operating model to the new strategy
that exercise confirm we hypothesis that we see the path to a couple of hundred basis_point and improve productivity as measure by the opex to sale ratio
many of the identify initiative require travel and team meeting
so as you could imagine they be on pause until thing settle down
however there be other initiative such as some contract improvement and indirect procurement savings that be move forward as we speak
we transformation effort be be lead by Kari Heerdt
I will now turn to we fiscal second quarter financial result before provide a update on the environment and then turn it over to John to review the detail of the_quarter
Greg Clark we interim CFO be under the weather right_now and out of a abundance of caution stay home
I would note that he and he team have be do a great job in finance as expect
we will then wrap up and open thing up for question
we fiscal second quarter result reflect solid execution in a uncertain environment
both sale and gross margin come within we guidance range with sale fall below the midpoint while gross margin be above it
operating_expense be also better than the guidance midpoint
and this be despite a extra roughly $ 1 million of consulting fee relate to the acceleration of the review of we operating model that I mention earlier
all tell both we operating margin and earnings per share come in at the midpoint of we guidance range
turn to the environment
industrial demand trend overall for the_quarter remain relatively soft
we do start to see a couple of encouraging datum point with January and February MBI reading improve to
but this be of course quickly erase by what unfold with the covid-19 outbreak and you no doubt see the March reading of which do not surprise we
in term of end market the weakness in industrial demand broaden further with pocket of softness in area like automotive heavy truck oil and gas and agriculture
Aerospace have also weaken due to the Boeing development and the building concern around covid-19
with regard to the pricing environment we continue to see list price movement from we supplier and we take a midyear price increase at the beginning of we fiscal third quarter or the beginning of March
realization have be quite good
in fact as good as anything we have see over the past several year
turn to we performance by customer type
National account decline in the low single digit while core customer decline in the mid-single digit as this be the portion of we business most heavily lever to metalworking so no surprise
government sale growth level deteriorate to down low teens which weigh down the overall growth
ccsg remain a bright spot grow in the low single digit
to be honest though all of that feel like ancient history
I will now turn to March we fiscal March because it be more reflective of what we be see since the acceleration of covid-19
while we fiscal March 's sale estimate come in at negative 5.8 % overall there be a few important trend to note under the surface
first there be a big discrepancy between the first 3 week and the last
through 3 week we revenue be up low single digit over prior year
we then see a big drop-off in the last 2 week as customer shutdown spread rapidly across the nation
this begin with the big auto shutdown and accelerate from there
and I will just remind you that we last week of March actually run in give the fiscal calendar run into April so include the first 3 day of April
the second point I would note be that we see a big discrepancy in product line performance
large order and sale of safety and janitorial product not surprisingly surge over prior year particularly with we government customer
at the same time other product line see a substantial drop-through the month with double-digit sale decline in the last 2 week
once again neither be surprising give the shutdown and worldwide effort to control covid-19
third thing I will note we see a unusually big gap between we booking or order and what we invoice
normally on these call we only discuss revenue but these be not normal time
we booking or order for March be up high single digit over the_prior_year
in fact we booking be up over prior year even during the last 2 week of we fiscal March
this gap in booking versus revenue actually begin in February where we also see booking growth over prior year
the unusually large gap in booking to revenue be a function of the surge in large safety and janitorial order scarcity of some of that product longer supplier lead time and a larger-than-normal backlog in we own warehouse
we anticipate the majority of these booking to invoice during the month of April , May and June which would offer we a growth tailwind to buffer any additional softness that may be yet to come
I will now turn thing over to John and I will then come back with some conclude remark
thank you Erik
so let I get right into the q2 number
we total average daily sale be $ 12.9 million a decrease of 2.9 % on a ADS basis versus the same quarter last year
MSC Mexico contribute approximately basis_point of acquisitive growth in the_quarter
the decrease in overall ADS be basis_point below the negative 2.5 % midpoint of we guidance range
we q2 report gross margin be 42.1 % basis_point above the midpoint of we guidance range reflect higher vendor rebate
Versus prior year gross margin be down roughly basis_point with Mexico accounting for roughly half of the decline
as expect the year-over-year gross margin decline continue shrink as purchase cost escalation continue to wane
March show nice gross margin performance due to the benefit of strong price realization
total operating_expense in q2 be $ 253 million slightly lower-than-expected as a percentage of sale
I will point out that opex include about $ 2 million of productivity investment related to the review of we operating model that Erik mention earlier
$ 1 million of this expense be in we q2 guidance while the other $ 1 million be due to the acceleration of that work
as Erik mention we be slow we spend on this type of work right_now but we expect to resume it once covid-19 be behind we
therefore should these expense become more material go forward we will break they out of we report earnings to provide you additional visibility
move on we operating margin be 9.9 % versus guidance of 9.7 %
we tax rate for the_first_quarter be 25.1 % in line with guidance and the_prior_year
all of this result in earnings per share of $ 1
normally we would take you through the balance_sheet at this point in the discussion
however today I would like to focus on where we be as of now and the action that we be take to ensure business resilience and continuity during this time of uncertainty
the q2 balance sheet number be in we press_release and the 10-q filing and we be of course happy to answer any question that you may have about where we stand at the end of q2
with the downturn in sale that we see in the last 2 week of March we be manage we liquidity very closely and we draw down $ 300 million from we revolve credit facility to ensure greater liquidity
on the receivables side of the business we have be manage the credit approval process closely
most new customer be be push toward credit card payment and we be carefully allocate inventory to exist customer
we have implement noncancellation policy on most large order and collection have remain relatively strong
most of many of the large order be come from long-standing government customer
when it come to inventory we be watch we level closely but you have hear we say before that in difficult time we will use we inventory level as a competitive differentiator
and remember book level have remain strong through March
should the environment weaken further we can and will adjust quickly
in fact we have already make several adjustment to take down buying level
and assume volume remain suppress we will continue do so in order to bring inventory level down
on the payable side we continue pay on a timely basis particularly those supplier that give we good term and a preferential position
those supplier offer timely delivery and deep discount will be push to the front of the line
turn to we ordinary dividend
we have ample liquidity to continue run the business and pay the current level of we dividend in all but the most severe scenario
we have conduct numerous best and worst-case sensitivity analysis and revenue would have to decline somewhere in the range of 40 % to 50 % before we operating cash flow turn negative
at these level we would take additional cost down action and could sustain multiple quarter give we liquidity position
I will now turn it back over to Erik
thanks John
give the unprecedented uncertainty that we be all face right_now include the lack of visibility that we have go forward and just how fast thing be change we do not think that quarterly guidance would provide much value
however we understand the need for transparency right_now for all of we stakeholder include we investor and analyst
so until we get through this period of heighten uncertainty we will be provide monthly update on average daily sale development as quickly as possible follow we month end close as well as comment on the business trend that we have see over the course of the month
I will offer some closing thought
we focus right_now be on navigate the impact of covid-19
I be confident that we be do the right thing to protect the health and safety of we associate to continue serve we customer in this critical time and to play we part in keep the manufacture economy running
I thank we entire team for this and I extend this appreciation to we customer and we supply chain partner who have all come together to address the challenge that all of we face
while the impact of covid-19 on the industrial economy will likely get worse before it get better thing will ultimately get better
MSC have be through difficult time before
and we will lean on we time-tested playbook anchor ourselves in we mission statement and we value
we will continue support we customer and we supplier through these tough time while advance we strategy to become mission-critical on the plant floor
finally we strong balance_sheet we culture and resolve mean that MSC will not only survive but we will ultimately emerge from this as a stronger company
we will now open up the line for question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- the first question today come from Ryan Merkel of William Blair
so first off I want to get a better sense of the sale trend line through March and into early April
you say the first 3 week of March be up low single digit but I be wonder what happen in the last 2 week
and be the trend line get a whole lot worse
and really I be just reach for any kind of read on how bad April could be
yes
Ryan sure
so as we mention yes March first 3 week and what I will do be split the discussion out into invoicing and then the book order which as I mention usually we do not talk about on this call but these be certainly unusual time
invoicing first 3 week average low single digit
you can do the math but the last 2 week drop into the double digit
I would not say it be progressively fall through those last 2 week
and the other thing I would note Ryan be for we April that last week in March for we include 3 day of April
so you be get a taste for April
and I would not call out any discernible difference between week and week in March
we be now in the first week of we fiscal April
so we literally have 2 day under we belt
and for the 2 day for what it be worth I would not call out anything different from the prior 2 week of note
that be the invoicing side
on the booking side as we mention Ryan what be interesting and I call it out because be in this business forever it be the thing that I usually look at as my lead indicator for how we be do
booking be we say for the month up high single digit certainly stronger the first 3 week
but even those last 2 week of the fiscal month year-on-year we be up
which obviously what that would mean as long as those order come through and we believe most will the invoicing will catch up and will provide a buffer
so that would be the color I would give you through the month
okay
so yes the bottom line be it be not sale be not fall off dramatically here in the last call it 7 to 10 day
I think be what I kind of feel
I mean certainly relative to the first 3 week a big step down but I would not say between the 2 week of week and week of March which again creep into April I would not see it as trend line straight down correct
okay
and then a follow-up there I probably could do the math but can you quantify the sale that be on back order as of March
and I assume this have continue into April as well
I mean how big could the backorder get
hard to give you a number but I mean just you could as you say Ryan just think about the difference between high single-digit on the order side and then a minus on the invoicing side
that be quite a bit of dollar
yes
okay
and then just lastly
and a lot of that as I say a lot of that we expect to build out over the come 3 month
right
right right right
okay
and then just lastly and I will turn it over a question on decremental margin
this_quarter decremental margin be about 50_% and sale be down 4 %
I be not sure if this be representative but any help you could provide on decremental margin for the next 2 quarter assume sale be down 10_% maybe 20_%
I will take that Ryan
this be John
I think you follow we a long time right of course
so we have talk about incremental margin in over history be in the 20 % to 30 % range
base on the modeling we be do I would say that we decremental margin would be in a similar range on the downside obviously let 's call it low 20s to low
and as you can imagine there be a lot of move part there right
so thing like gross margin performance mix the size and timing of cost action and quite a few number of other factor
but I think low 20s to low would put you in the right range
you next question today come from John Inch of Gordon Haskett
and hopefully Greg just have a cold
he be do okay
just
I understand better to be safe than sorry
can we maybe put a finer point around the magnitude of personal protective equipment janitorial
what normally do these category represent Erik in term of the mix
and what be you actually see today
and I be just try to dovetail that with the fact that government despite the surge in order be still only 7 % of the total revenue in the fiscal second quarter kind of flat sequentially
be there a way you could sort of size these bucket for we proportionally versus kind of what it normally be
yes
look John you be hone right in on a couple of the big change that we see
it be almost it be funny because I look back at the number and notice the same thing that if you look at q2 you do not see much of a difference at all in government
you be right at 7 %
-lsb- q2 -rsb- which end in February almost feel like a different world
we be if we look ahead base on the order activity and early invoicing activity for government we would certainly expect that number to jump up considerably
John part of the challenge here be the timing of when these order actually hit
it be tough for I to give you a number but suffice it to say I would be surprise if government as a percentage of sale do not take a meaningful jump in we q3
you other question be a product one and related to let 's say PPE the product line safety and janitorial
what I would say there be quietly over the_year we have build up a really strong safety business
metalwork far and away the biggest category we have sort of color that for you
the second biggest be the class C part and we have kind of color that for you
behind those two this would be the next biggest category
it be be grow for year
it have also float as you could imagine
so if we look at the sort of the order activity in the past month 6 week versus the prior run rate multiple bigger than it be
so again I would be surprise if move forward we do not see a big jump up as a percentage of revenue
right
so it sound like you be say those category combine maybe historically be in the teens
and then if you we be probably go to see a big surge on top of that
I think that make sense
it would not be box car
John one interesting note by the way that I will call out be look it be not surprising that there be demand for product safety product and janitorial product in this environment
I think the real trick and the secret sauce and I think where we be have some success be find source of supply
because supply be so limited
and I give a shout out to we category team but I do think we have develop a lot of relationship over the_year have a lot of good source capability and it be give we access to tap into source that maybe other can not
and hopefully that will give we a opportunity to take advantage and help a lot of people out
yes
maybe you can pass along those skill to the federal government
wondering about so I be just go to give a specific example
Honeywell issue a letter to its supplier
this be in its performance material business basically impose a 30 % price cut on procured product across the board
be you see it be obviously a extreme case
I understand maintenance repair operate supplies be go to be different than they component and other feedstock that go into that product line
but be you see pressure similarly from say you national account customer to renegotiate various contract or pretty good right and the acceptance of the price increase seem to be pretty good
I be just wonder though on the look forward as a lot of company get stressed and national account be obviously very important for you
what kind of early read be you get from you customer base
and how do you think kind of MSC be go to fare through all of this
yes really good question again
here be what I would say John
so first off let I just comment briefly on we price realization
I flag it because it have be better than expect
and that be because we actually implement it be not a total surprise
I mean we make a few I would call it improvement to we execution on the pricing front between we pricing team and we sale team and those be pay off
I think those should sustain base on the result I be see and how they be track back to action we take
so I like what I be see there
in term of the environment it be a interesting dynamic John
because on the one hand certainly you be go to have company who be feel a lot of financial pressure and be go to look to take cost out
that will be there
no question
the flip side be this be a bit different kind of a typical recession in many way
but one way be scarcity of product and access to key product
so there be certain area where customer just want to be able to get product in the door to keep they people safe and keep they operation go
so it be a bit different from you typical recession
so those would be kind of compete factor
net-net so far no reason I be not see anything that would lead I to believe pricing realization should decline from here
get it
just maybe one last one
in the cash_flow inventory be a large sequential drag and I guess payable be a large sequential source
what be you see with respect to you work capital
be customer be they slower to pay in turn be you sort of you mention you be actually pay on time
I mean how be you guy think about manage work capital
and what be you expectation in term of how the resource be use in the come in the coming quarter particularly if sale obviously this be go to be the toughest quarter
we hope it be only the toughest quarter for top line right in the June quarter I mean second calendar quarter
yes
let I take that John
as you can imagine we be watch we work capital and we cash flow extremely closely on every single day
I get report first thing in the morning
we we receivables so far have be remarkably relatively strong I would say as in we payable
we have keep up because the world at least if you look at the number the world be not fall apart yet
but that be why we be watch it very very closely right
from a inventory standpoint as you know we typically as a distributor generate a lot of cash in a downturn because of inventory
you would not have see that come into the q2 because we fiscal q2 of course straddle year-end which be when we typically take advantage of opportunity buy right
and then that plus the fact that we booking be very positive towards the end of February and through March and combine that as well with we commitment to have product available to we customer it mean we want to keep inventory on the shelf and keep use that as a big differentiator
lastly I will add that safety and janitorial supply be very limited so we be go to buy all we can of those kind of product
but at the end of the day if the environment weaken further we can and we will adjust inventory quickly and draw they down and generate a lot more cash
we next question today come from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies
my first question and you touch on this Erik a little bit in you prepared remark but I know it be early high level operationally strategy wise culturally do you see this as change you business positively or negatively
any high level thought
Hamzah I mean another great question
I get to tell you it be still it be something that be begin to cross my mind but I would say still we be so early in this Hamzah
and so much be yet to be determine about how long we be in this sort of new normal what the new normal means and how long before we be back
what I would tell you be it be a bit early to say
the one thing that I would flag be just it be be amazing to I to see we culture
so this be sort of more of a right brain thing than a left brain thing right
but to see we culture in action and to see people rally around the company rally to support each other rally to support customer and supplier it be be invigorating
and there be be a real sort of surge and renaissance in the culture if you will watch we whole team in action and see we kind of adhere to the value that we have always adhere to see how we take a long-term perspective
so the one thing I would call out be a positive from that standpoint that in the face of adversity I like what I be see from how we be respond
beyond that I think a little too early to say
Erik and Hamzah I would add that we model of distribute goods and product directly to the customer really work well in this environment
we if they want we there we can be there with we full-service and solution
but if they do not we can ship we goods right to they dock and they can keep operate without we have to come into the premise
get it
and just a follow-up
how do you balance sort of liquidity and potentially distressed asset out there where maybe you can do M&A
I know you be excite
last quarter the bar on M&A be higher
you be sort of go through a restructuring still but now sort of the world have change a little bit
be the M&A sort of bar still pretty high
or do that change because you may have a lot of distressed company out there that may fit you book of business
so Hamzah what I would say be for now the bar on M&A be still very high especially in this environment
look we feel really good about we liquidity position
and John sort of run through a framework with you to give you a sense as to why
and then you think about how this business normally perform in a downturn with work capital as we be touch on with John earlier
so we feel good about we liquidity position
there be go to be opportunity that emerge here for sure and there be go to be opportunity to invest
and whether that be in people or system or company just not yet
and certainly as it relate to M&A give where we be at the answer be for now certainly the bar remain high
we next question today come from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James
Erik John I hope both of you and you family be well
two question if I might
one of they be a piggyback on a prior question around you receivables collection
one of the thing I mean we be all look at ' 08 ' 09 at least for a guidepost in term of what might happen
one of the thing I find interesting be that you allowance for doubtful account never really spike in ' 08 ' 09
it get to about 4 % of gross receivables which be really not all that dissimilar from where you be at now
Erik help we or remind we as to why allowance do not spike or at least historically do not spike in recession
be it something to do with you customer list
be it something how you tactically go to COD
and how might you look at receivables collectability in a worst-case scenario if this thing do drag on
yes sure
I mean I be happy to give you some historic perspective and John can weigh in on how we be manage it now
but look I think Sam we manage it tightly all the time
we be manage it more tightly now
and what that mean be have very proactive good relationship with customer long-standing relationship with customer
and so there be dialogue go on all the time
and that combine with make some sort of common sense move as John reference
so if there be go to be a new customer come in that we be not familiar with move that to credit card payment
when it come to large order we be make sure that it be with good long-standing customer with good payment track record
in some case noncancellation policy
so do some common sense thing and then I think leverage a lot of year of good relationship
John I do not know if you have anything to add
the other thing I would point out I guess Sam be the ' 08 crisis be pretty sharp and pretty quick
right_now with COVID we really do not know
it be build a little momentum but so far it be not as bad as it could get
now we draw down $ 300 million on we revolver as I say to preserve liquidity so that we have that cash
we have not have to use it really yet
so it be the right thing to do
we feel for we company but we be we will continue watch receivables very very closely
my last question and this might be granular but you have get a very technically proficient sale force that retention be go to be quite critical
I be guess you be consider this a fix cost or at least largely a fix cost
how be you specifically address variable comp with salespeople over the next few month to maintain retention level
President , CEO & Director line we salespeople
you can imagine Sam a sensitive one from a competitive standpoint
but suffice it to say that we be take environmental factor into account as we look at variable comp and make sure that inside the company we have a mantra about do the right thing
and when it come to we salespeople we be do the right thing
I will kind of leave it at that
but just to say we be proactively address the issue
the next question today come from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research
I want to I have a couple of gross margin question for you
when we think about safety product and government business I guess I would have think that that would be softer gross margin-type product for the company maybe not in total
but John you have mention that March gross margin performance be pretty good with the price increase
I be wonder if you could just mention for we the margin profile of that business as some of those order start to come through
Adam yes
so what I would say on gross margin be you sort of have different there be always gross margin be always kind of like a series with some tailwind and headwind
what we call out be a tailwind be the price increase we take and the strong realization
so as we look forward certainly that be a tailwind
as it relate to and it be one of the reason by the way what you be hit on be one of the reason why try to give guidance now would be so fruitless and difficult because one of the other factor that influence gross margin be price its cost and its mix
and John describe how on of the factor cost be start to move in the right direction
he talk about it in the prepared remark
pricing be move in the right direction we talk about
mix be a real wildcard right_now
and it just be so hard because to predict because of the timing and the size of some of these order
we approach to price a lot of this business have be to do it just as we have always do it consistent with how we price it 2 month ago before there be a crisis
so yes in some case some of those order be go to come in below company average
in some case they will come in at or above
very difficult but you be right what it could make for we be a little choppiness as it relate to mix
yes
I would just add in Adam I think we have over the_year we have at least allude if not say directly that government sale be typically lower than the company average gross margin just like national account sale be as well
so yes that would be a headwind
I do not know
we have not we certainly have not break out various product gross margin
so I will not go there on the janitor and safety stuff
okay
and then could you dimension the magnitude of the price increase
remind we what that be
it be in the neighborhood of 1 % to 2 % I would say
it be definitely smaller than last_year 's midyear increase
okay
Got you
and then the supplier program Erik that you have mention at the beginning of the call that some of they be potentially at risk with volume-related rebate
I be just wonder how much of this do we think could stay I think I hear you say the majority of it that might have mishear
any directional sense
and then just for the accounting of that be that accrue for as we move through the rest of the_year or we start accrue for that in the_fourth_quarter
yes Adam
and just to be clear on the supplier program the program be all intact
and in fact I think at a time like this we need we supplier and we supplier need we we need to lean on each other
program be all intact no change
so the only change I flag Adam be that if you look forward and if a decent portion of the benefit be in the form of guarantee rebate let 's say a guarantee rebate get pay back to dollar one of purchase
obviously if purchase come down if there be a extended period of economic slowdown and purchase come down the absolute dollar level of the program will come down
that be what I be try to get across
in term of when you would start to see that the way the accrual work for the rebate John I believe it will begin in we fiscal fourth quarter and move through the rest of the calendar year
and again it be one of those thing Adam where it be so hard to predict because it be supplier by supplier and in some case to the extent that they be safety supplier you can imagine purchase be go to be through the roof
if it be somewhere else it be go to be lower
so it be really tricky to model out
but I flag it because it likely could be a headwind if there be a protracted downturn
the next question today come from David Manthey of Baird
first Erik you indicate that you increase headcount in the hunter role during the_second_quarter
and obviously as a company you be play a lot of defense right_now
but can you tell we how you will keep the mission-critical partner strategy move forward during the crisis and then even potentially several weak quarter thereafter
how do you keep the wheel in motion there
yes Dave good question
so what yes I do mention we hunter so the bd or the Hunter role be the part of the business where we be really throttle up and we have be see good success in capture new customer relationship or expand what be a small relationship into a big relationship
in some way it sound crazy but the whole mission-critical concept that I be see this now in sort of the cultural surge inside the company that I have talk about become more important than ever
business many of we customer be consider essential business
and they need to keep they operation run in some way shape or form
so the way we deliver on this promise be the idea of be mission-critical means we be there with you
we be there with you on the plant floor
we be there with you to solve you toughest problem
we have have to adapt a little bit because in some case maybe we be not actually inside the customer shop and we be do this virtually by phone
but I think it be give we a chance to bring the value prop and this new strategy alive in a new and exciting way
I mean we be help keep operation go
okay
and then in past downturn MSC have invest aggressively into the decline in some case
be it just too early to make that call Erik
do you wait till we go past the coronavirus and then see what the economy look like thereafter before you make that call
Dave I think it be a little bit early
I do think that there be go to be some good opportunity that emerge and we would take a consistent approach in term of look and be on we toe and capitalize on those opportunity I think just not yet
the next question today come from Michael McGinn of Wells Fargo
if I could start off with the SG&A initiative the direct savings the T&E consulting discretionary spend and Capex can you put a be you able to put a dollar figure to that what the first tranche
and then maybe if thing get progressively a bit worse what would a second tranche look like
sure
sure
so yes you have hit on
I mean we have take pretty much the basic move out early I think
we have take out call it stuff you be look for a range somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 500,000 a week run rate wise that we have take out through the action that we talk about earlier
certainly we be ready if we need to to take out more cost
there would be significantly more cost out to come
the way we would do that at some point depend upon how bad thing get some of the action begin to to lean on we mission statement we value we track record and do thing in a way back to the mantra of do the right thing
that be how we would go about do it
and I be go to lean on the playbook that my predecessor David Sandler year ago navigate we brilliantly through ' 08 ' 09 and it be all about we team share in pain collectively and lead from the top and we would take very much the same approach if we need to go deeper
get it
appreciate the color
and if I could just switch gear to more of a long-term question
if this end up be have some effect down the line towards social distancing
how be you look to the_future for you spec sale
you guy have always do these in-shop study
you should be use x product instead of y you get better turn you will get better efficiency and you lower you cost with this product
from a spec sale standpoint be you able to do that virtual online sharing of CAD document or whatever it may be
how do you look at that long term
that be a great question
so thing I would say
one be that John mention it earlier
if this sort of become the new normal or the new normal for a long period of time be let 's start with we logistics model I think really lend itself well to this world because it be a centralized model shipping into remote location relatively low touch
so I think that work out really well
in term of the engineer side of the value proposition the mission-critical part look what I would say be we be go to use technology
and we have actually be use technology for quite a while
so we have in certain location a lot of we tech team believe it or not actually sit in centralize call center environment and provide just as deep technical expertise and advice and do it over the phone or with FaceTime and with technology
I think what would happen be we would take that model and we would expand upon that for bigger customer
so certainly it would be different but not something we be unaccustomed to
okay
if I could sneak more in on the discrepancy versus invoice versus order
be there a way to disaggregate what have come in from a order standpoint that be not from that large government customer that may be that smaller shop of employee that be potentially more at risk at shut_down
what have the order flow be for those high demand product thus far
yes
so we do Mike we look at it way till Sunday by for the invoicing and for the order come in
what I would say be look there be some of everything come in but the majority the concentration of the large order would be from a product standpoint safety and janitory related
and then from a customer segment there be certainly some come from smaller shop but the majority would be between government customer and we larger national account would be where the bulk of they be come from
the next question today come from Patrick Baumann of JP Morgan
maybe just kind of circle back on some of the earlier discussion
if you could help we understand the on decremental margin the kind of the key variable in that low 20s to low 30 framework
be it a certain range of sale decline
be it maybe how do you expect gross margin to behave in that kind of think high level about that framework and what be the variable
so Pat we look at numerous scenario from 10_% to 20_% down and further beyond that obviously area where we be nowhere near today
but we I think that that general range of low 20s to low work pretty much all the way down and even towards the worst scenario we could we model at least let 's say
so I would not get into the detail of gross margin and all that
but that be the best we can do I think with the modeling that we do so far unless Erik do you have anything to add
yes
maybe just comment John
so I think that range of low 20s to low
the reason for the broad range be actually one of the biggest factor Pat you be hit on be gross margin
it be hard to predict how it perform
so you can imagine the better gross margin do the closer we get to the low 20s and the worst to the low
the only other thing I would call out and I think Ryan in the initial question ask this the decremental actually look worse over the last year than the range we give
obviously what that range be reflective of be considerable action be take by the company
so what you be see at the various level to be able to keep to the low 20s to low be there be significant cost action be take beyond what we have do over the past year
and then the gross margin would be the driver behind the size of the range
okay
get it
that be helpful
and I guess maybe go back to I do not know if it be Ryan 's question earlier somebody be ask about March sale but so February be down 4 % to 5 % but you see March improve to low single digit in the first 3 week
just what drive that improvement
be that all the safety and janitorial stuff
be that what drive kind of that step-up versus February
actually the improvement in the step-up be because a lot of the safety and janitorial stuff end up be back order or direct ship and it be why there be this building gap between booking and invoice
and we actually see broad-based relative strength
I mean if you call low single-digit strength
relative strength from where it be more broad-based
try to parse out why one theory be just in time of uncertainty customer want to whether it be safety product or not buy up a little bit
we also so I would say that be probably the biggest factor but it be more broad-based
okay
and then just last one back to that question earlier as well
if I run that quick back of the envelope on low single-digit growth in the first 3 week and what that imply for the last 2 week I get to something like I do not know mid-teens or so decline
be that in the ballpark of what you see kind of at the end of the month
somewhere in the ballpark
and the only other color there would be not much of a difference between week and week
and we last question today come from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets
just go back to some of the conversation around deliver the value proposition
I want to ask how customer attitude towards vend and VMI be change
be there more interest give better control and tracking
or do they want more delivery to dock to limit access to facility
interesting question Steve
what I would say be two thing
one it be a little early to say
this be so brand new
two we have have compete dynamics
so on the one hand right_now a good portion of we customer have either shut_down and that be somewhere by the way base on we latest datum and the datum keep change around 20_% or so a little over 20_% of we customer have shut_down
and then another chunk of customer be operate but have restricted access to any visitor from the outside
so when we think about how often we be actually go in and replenish a vend or VMI installation right_now it be somewhere in the 40 % to 50 % range
so certainly and look we think that be temporary
temporary that be down
the flip side have be believe it or not and this surprised we the number of like new VMI implementation for instance that we do a week or ago be one of the highest we have ever do which really surprise we
so it be a little bit of a mixed bag right_now
I think temporarily though what you be see be customer restrict access which may if they be not shut down restrict access
so we be enable they
we be give they the technology and the tool to be able to replenish on they own if they need to temporarily
yes
and I be sure that of that 20_% that shut_down a lot of those be metalwork customer in the automotive supply_chain or something
just any more commentary on how demand for those product progress in the back half of March
and where do you think inventory level be with you customer and in you own system give we be see some decelerate trend in metalworking already
so first part of you question you be correct
in term of closure everywhere but acute in the Midwest relate to auto no question
you be correct there
in term of customer inventory level look they definitely they have be build but it be really hard to say because especially when it come to some of these large order it be almost like there be not enough to be have
so we be get these huge quantity
and even when they be be fulfil customer be come back and say we need more
it be really hard to judge
a lot just a murky time
this conclude we question-and-answer session

I would now like to hand the conference over to you speaker today Patrick Lynch CEO
thank you
please go ahead sir
good morning
I be Patrick Lynch NTIC 's CEO and I be here with Matt Wolsfeld NTIC 's CFO as well as Vineet Dalal Vice President and Director of Global Market Development for we Natur-Tec business
please note that the financial result for we fiscal 2020 second quarter be include in a press_release issue earlier this morning a copy of which be available at ntic.com
during this call we will review various key aspect of we fiscal 2020 second quarter financial result provide a brief business update and then conclude with a question-and-answer session
we fiscal 2020 second quarter financial result be significantly influence by the economic and business impact of the covid-19_pandemic
when compare to either the_second_quarter last fiscal year or the_first_quarter of_fiscal demand for ZERUST industrial product slow substantially in North_America China and across we joint venture network
demand for Natur-Tec compostable bioplastic however remain comparable to the prior fiscal year quarter and Zerust Oil & Gas sale increase significantly as several delayed project from we first quarter be install during the_second_quarter
with many of we global customer currently run at a fraction of they regular capacity or lock down altogether we anticipate sale for we third quarter to be down considerably compare to the prior fiscal year quarter
furthermore since the covid-19 crisis continue and be evolve we be withdraw and suspend specific full year fiscal guidance
on behalf of the entire leadership team and the Board of director of NTIC we thought be with anyone who have be affect by the covid-19_pandemic
while we have have to adjust we near-term priority we long-term market opportunity and growth strategy remain intact
we current intent be to continue provide uninterrupted order fulfillment and customer service while ensure the safety of we customer joint venture and employee
overall we be enter this period of uncertainty from a position of strength as a result of we asset-light and highly profitable business model experienced leadership team and excellent capital structure
we currently have over $ 12 million in cash and cash equivalent and available-for-sale security
additionally we be evaluate the availability of government support program associate with the CARES Act that be sign into law on March 27 , 2020
so with this overview let 's examine the driver for the_second_quarter
for the_second_quarter end February 29 , 2020 total consolidated net sale decrease 0.6 % to $ 13.2 million as compare to the_second_quarter end February 28 , 2019
Broken down by business unit this include a 198.6 % increase in Zerust Oil & Gas sale and a 0.3 % increase in Natur-Tec net sale offset by a 4.2 % decrease in ZERUST industrial net sale and a 65.4 % decrease in net sale from NTIC to its ZERUST joint venture
total net sale by we joint venture which we do not consolidate in we financial statement be $ 24.3 million for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compare to $ 27.7 million for the same period last fiscal year
this 12.5 % decline in joint venture net sale be at first the result of already soften worldwide demand across many of the industrial market we serve and then later in the_quarter be compound by the effect of the covid-19_pandemic
net sale by we wholly own NTIC China subsidiary increase 0.6 % to $ 3 million for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compare to the same period last fiscal year
NTIC China benefit from higher sale earlier in the_second_quarter prior to chinese New year and the impact of the covid-19_pandemic
NTIC China sale have return to 75 % of pre-pandemic level last month and we be cautiously optimistic that they will return to 100 % of the sale of the prior sale level by the end of the third quarter as China have recently restart its economy and lift business restriction previously impose to mitigate the spread of covid-19
overall we remain optimistic about the long-term potential in China as we intend to further expand we presence within this large and grow market
as expect Zerust Oil & Gas sale increase significantly during the_second_quarter as a result of several customer have delay product shipment from we first quarter
however oil and gas sale remain volatile primarily due to long sale cycle overall challenge market condition and the timing of order and delivery
the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war and the covid-19_pandemic have have a significant impact on oil price with the latter impact we ability to travel to customer site and to install we solution
we expect that oil and gas sale will be materially impact for the duration of the covid-19 crisis
we remain committed to the oil and gas market and believe we will be successful over time as more oil and gas customer adopt we solution and replace other form of corrosion protection
now let I turn the call over to Vineet to review we Natur-Tec bioplastic business in more detail
thank you Patrick
I be happy to join today 's call to review we Natur-Tec business in more detail
I have be a member of NTIC 's leadership team for nearly 16 year
and for most of my time at the company I have focus on Natur-Tec
in addition to my natur-tec responsibility I also sit on the Board of the Biodegradable Products Institute a u.s.-based organization that promote the adoption and use of compostable plastic
Natur-Tec have become a leader in the bioplastic industry as a result of we patented and proprietary technology
Natur-Tec create 100 % compostable plastic alternative with performance characteristic comparable to those of conventional single-use plastic at a price that be affordable and competitive
over the_year we have also form important partnership with key feedstock supplier and develop strong relationship with key converter and brand around the globe
over the past year societal and political criticism due to the environmental and waste disposal concern of conventional single-use plastic have drive significant interest in and demand for alternative which have create a compelling global market environment for Natur-Tec 's bio-based and compostable product solution
we believe the industry dynamics for bioplastic be sustainable as more country as well as state and local municipality be put in place sustainable waste management initiative
for the fiscal 2020 second quarter Natur-Tec net sale be $ 4.2 million and be in line with sale last_year despite the headwind face Natur-Tec associate with chinese tariff the chinese New year shutdown and the impact the covid-19_pandemic have on sale in China and South Asia during the_quarter
for the near term we anticipate the covid-19 crisis will continue to impact Natur-Tec sale because stay-at-home mandate have close college campus stadium arena corporate office complex and other large user of compostable plastic
furthermore production across the apparel industry have decline sharply as a result of the covid-19_pandemic decrease demand for natur-tec bioplastic bag which have become a important part of the sustainability initiative within this industry
due to the impact of the stay-at-home mandate in various country around the world we expect the apparel packaging business to be soft for at least the next 2 quarter
however to date we continue to see strong demand from exist and new customer and during the_quarter begin supply we proprietary resin compound to one of the world 's largest manufacturer of cutlery within the food service industry
we expect this business to be strong and grow as hygiene consideration from the covid-19 crisis sustain demand for compostable food service application
as you can see we have build a strong bioplastic business that be support by we patented technology as well as compelling industry dynamics and favorable environmental and regulatory priority
we be extremely excite to be a leader within the industry and I look forward to provide update on we success in future call
now I will turn the call back over to Patrick
thank you Vineet for the additional insight on Natur-Tec
to conclude my prepared remark we all know that there be significant uncertainty due to the impact of the covid-19_pandemic
however NTIC 's long-standing leadership team have successfully navigate a number of prior crisis include the great recession of and
since then of course we have greatly expand we geographic end market and product diversity
in addition the size and scale of we business have increase
finally the strength of we balance_sheet and benefit of we asset-light business model provide we with significant flexibility and resource to help we navigate this time of economic and business uncertainty
I would like to use this opportunity to thank all of we global employee and joint venture partner
on behalf of the entire leadership team thank you for you hard work and dedication throughout this crisis
with this overview let I now turn the call over to Matt Wolsfeld to summarize we financial result for the fiscal 2020 second quarter
thanks Patrick
NTIC 's net sale decrease less than 1 % in fiscal 2020 second quarter as a result of the joint venture operating income which decrease 17 % for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compare to the prior fiscal year
as allude to in the first quarter earnings call total operating_expense increase during the_second_quarter and total $ 6.5 million compare to $ 5.4 million for the same period last_year
the 19.7 % year over-year increase be primarily due to the timing of higher g&a expense incur during the_quarter
we continue to proactively control expense
and year-to-date total operating_expense increase 6.8 % which be in line with both we budget and expectation
in addition we expect operating_expense to decline year-over-year in the fiscal 2020 third quarter
we fiscal 2020 second quarter income tax expense increase 88.2 % to $ 464,000 as a result of foreign tax pay on higher level of dividend and distribution we receive from we joint venture during the_quarter
we expect the effective rate to reduce greatly in we third and fourth quarter
NTIC report net income of $ 180,000 or $ 0.02 per diluted share for the fiscal 2020 second quarter compare to $ 1.4 million or $ 0.15 per diluted share for the fiscal 2019 second quarter
as of February 29 , 2020 work capital be $ 29.4 million include $ 5.6 million in cash and cash equivalent and $ 6.5 million in available-for-sale security compare to $ 25.5 million include $ 5.9 million in cash and cash equivalent and $ 3.6 million in available-for-sale security as of August 31 , 2019
as a note we be currently evaluate the opportunity afford to we by the CARES Act that be sign into law March 27 , 2020
while we while the extent of the support be uncertain at this time the CARES Act include a sweeping set of financial relief measure in the form of federally guarantee loan that can be forgive base on payment make for payroll utility health care benefit and other approve effort to retain employee
on February 29 , 2020 the company have $ 21.3 million in investment in joint venture of which 48.7 % or $ 10.4 million be in cash with the remain balance primarily invest in work capital
during the fiscal 2020 second quarter NTIC 's Board of director declare a cash dividend of $ 0.165 per share and be payable on February 19 , 2020 to shareholder of record on February 5 , 2020
as Patrick comment earlier in this call give current circumstance we be suspend full fiscal year guidance
with this overview Patrick Vineet and I be happy to take you question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from the line of Tim Clarkson from Van Clemens Capital
just some question
I know that we be put a little bit more emphasis on the compostable part of the business
and just some basic question that be I think critical to understand this
can you explain the difference between compostable product and biodegradable product
Tim this be Vineet
yes
I will take that
so biodegradable product be be a very general term
there be a lot of spurious product in the market which use conventional plastic and they will add additive to it and they will call they oxo-degradable
unfortunately these kind of product be not consider biodegradable especially in place like the state of California and there be rule which prohibit the marketing of such mislabeled product
we product or the product that Natur-Tec sell be certify compostable
and what that mean be that in a composting environment 100 % of the product get convert to be consume by the microorganism in the disposal environment as a food source and get convert to co2 water and biomass
so these be certified compostable by independent third-party lab
Great
now what be the characteristic that make Natur-Tec 's compostable product superior to the competition
we the main advantage really be we product be stronger
we formulate they
we have extremely good understanding of the chemistry behind these material and we use that understand to formula product that be stronger cheaper and easier to process on conventional plastic process equipment
right
now can you explain how that dynamic play into I know you mention this significant new opportunity you have for the company that make cutlery can you explain how that act you get that contract
so this be a large brand
they sell a lot of cutlery single-use disposable cutlery in the U.S. market
they have be work with polylactic acid or pla which be one of the raw material for over 5 year and they do not have any success
they come to we
and we actually have a compound or a resin solution that actually would work in this situation
so we work closely with one we conversion partner in Asia and develop a solution that meet the rigorous performance requirement for this brand
and it be the unique understanding of the chemistry as well as the processing that allow we to create a solution that meet the performance tolerance for this specific brand
I hear that the competition 's product would get clog in the machine
yes
well the competition 's product they would get warped or they would not perform as well
they do not have the heat resistance or the strength require for the application
right
okay
can you explain this the concept of have a close system in a cafeteria or fast food
and how that would work to divert commonly trash organic waste into a compostable system
so if you look at municipal solid waste stream pretty much in any city or state about 50_% 55 % of the municipal solid waste stream be what be call organic waste
there be food waste yard waste compostable paper
and typically a lot of these municipality and state have pass regulation which prohibit the dump of this organic waste into landfill
these have to be collect separately and send to industrial composting facility
and the reason for that be this organic waste actually in a landfill would generate methane and methane be 25x more dangerous as a greenhouse gas as compare to co2
so what we compostable product do be they assist in the collection of this organic waste
and if you look at university or school district or large office campus they have cafeteria on site and they will use we compostable cutlery
they will use we compostable bag
they will collect the food waste as well as the back-of-the-kitchen vegetable peel and other waste and they will divert all of that organic waste away from landfill to composting
and so that be what be call zero-waste system closed-loop system and that be where we compostable product really come in and help enable the implementation of these closed-loop initiative
and would that work in fast food place too
yes
it be start to
a lot of the if you look at city out in the West Coast they be now say that fast food or QSR restaurant have to comply with the organic diversion mandate in those city
so large QSR chain like McDonald 's be now look to implement especially in the with eat-in-the-restaurant option they be look to implement compostable product
sure
one last question and I will quit hog
this be to the I guess to Matt and Pat
I mean be there a consideration ever of spin off the Natur-Tec division and maybe raise some money separately
we have talk about that but we do not have any specific plan for that in place at this time
I mean just theoretically if you do do that what would be potentially some of the advantage of do that
Matt you want to talk about that
I think the clear advantage would be that Natur-Tec as a stand-alone entity could potentially drive it would be it would potentially drive not necessarily a different investor set but certainly with the current environment from invest as far as the opportunity with green technology I think it would potentially be value a little differently and probably a little bit higher than the traditional Northern Technologies market that serve more of a more industrial application and oil and gas application
so as a stand alone I think it would potentially be a very clear nice environmental investment
but I think ultimately we be wait we would like to see revenue grow significantly higher than where they be now in order to be able to do that
packaging product like this
Correct
Correct
we next question come from the line of -lsb- Kim Chatard -rsb- from -lsb- Merit Investments -rsb-
just on the expense they be a little bit higher in this_quarter
can you maybe help with what the_year might look like in absolute dollar for expense
sure
as I take a look at it one of the thing the company be always not always but certainly over the past few year have strive to do be have total operating expense growth in the mid-single digit
so when I look at the year-to-date number total operating_expense have grow by about 6.8 %
that be pretty much in line with where we expect to be for the full year
however give what be go on right_now with the covid-19 no travel people work from home I would anticipate that for the next at least probably or 4 month we be go to see a dramatic decrease in we operating_expense
so for the full year I would probably anticipate that go down as far as the growth year-over-year go down to the low single digit maybe 2 % or 3 % operate growth
so something in the low $ 20 million number
we next question come from the line of Gus Richard from Northland
yes
just real quick
China announce early this year a ban on single-use plastic
a lot have change since then
could you talk a little bit about what you be see there
be there a opportunity for you as they try to move to compostable or eliminate its use
you be talk about China right
yes
so this be announce right before the chinese New year shutdown and then they have the covid-19 crisis
it be a positive development in we view but there be still we still have to kind of figure out the exact detail because the proof be go to be in the pudding to say as in the implementation be go to be very critical
the enforcement of that ban be go to be critical
and so with all this uncertainty it still remain to be see how that be go to pan out
but yes we team in China be look at that as a potential opportunity for we
get it
and then can you talk a little bit about as the travel restriction et_cetera go into place in China what that trajectory look like
and then now that it be come out what that trajectory look like
and then can you compare and contrast that to the U.S. and Europe what you have see so far as these region have shift to adapt to the reality of covid-19
sure
when look at China basically what we have be we have sale that be really start to rebind in we in the first with what we be start to see come out of first quarter into the_second_quarter we be have some relatively strong month as we talk about during the prepared remark
China year-over-year include 3 to 6 month be basically flat
and give what we see basically with the entire shutdown of everything in China start on January 15 pretty much through the end of the quarter to be flat be a little bit surprising to we because obviously we have a strong December and strong first half of January to be able to achieve that
so come out of the shutdown basically the entire month of March thing be start to ramp back up
the second half of March be significantly stronger than the first half
and ultimately March finish marked we China number for March finish where they be operate close to 80 % of what the call it the pre-january 15 run rate be
and so with the discussion that we have have with that leadership team and look at they anticipate product shipment kind of throughout April and then the rest of the_quarter and the rest of the_year they expect to back up operate above 100 % of what the run rate be pre-pandemic they expect to be above that run rate basically start with the end of April and May
so we be see a pretty quick rebound in the chinese market kind of come out of the shutdown
as far as how that kind of flow through the rest of the world it seem like at least to we with kind of talk to various partner that obviously what be go_on in Europe and what be go_on in North_America be probably about 3 to 5 week behind 3 to 6 week behind where China be during that time period as we have see thing spread
and obviously if you look at the chart you can kind of see almost exactly the number of day everything be behind
I do not know if the United_States be go to be as capable as China be in shut thing down and then come back out of it similar to Europe
China basically shut_down from January 15 until let 's say the end of February so basically 45 day
I would guess that it be go to take the Europe and United_States if you be on that same trajectory would potentially be 2x that
but still it look if it follow that kind of that same path we be look at a couple month of thing be very slow where we anticipate we sale to drop dramatically in kind of April and May
and then hopefully at that point in time we can start see the sale rebound
so that be kind of what we what we be modeling internally as far as how we be keep thing on hold how we be work through sale
I do know that because of I would say especially in North_America where we have the most visibility into we customer I think a lot of we customer have the ability to at least see what be go_on in other part of the world
and so we see a little bit of a stock up take place in March
so even though thing be start to slide a little bit in February and people be get a little bit cautious there certainly be some opportunity that we have where people be shut_down plant or stock up for when they be go to restart business that make March not as March be stronger than what we anticipate it would be even though everybody in NTIC be basically work from home except for the operation team and the shipping team and thing like that
so that be really what we be keep we eye on be how quickly the United_States would be able to kind of come out of that kind of come out of when we will bottom out and then when will start to rebind from on that
and just one follow-up
the peak to trough in China versus the peak to trough in U.S. and Europe be that 100 % 25 % or whatever it be in China
what do that look like
have U.S. and Europe shut off as tightly at this point or not quite so much
well I do not think it certainly have not shut off
I mean in China what happen be everything be shut down and nothing ship
I mean literally the when they do a shutdown it be there be not one order deliver place during that 45-day period
maybe people they just do not leave they home anybody
and what we be see in Europe and what we be see in North_America be people be still go to work
people be still ship product
people be still it be just everything from a industrial standpoint as far as car production and thing like that be still take place
now we know that the big auto company have since put in place a or 3-week shutdown that they be in the middle of
but what we see in China be dramatically different than any of the response that we have see in Europe or in North_America
at this time I be show no further question
I would like to turn the call back over to Patrick Lynch for close remark
I would just like to thank everybody for participate today and for you interest in NTIC
Hope you have a great week

Dr. Aklog
thank you Mike
good afternoon everyone and thank you for join we on this quarterly call to update you on we business and discuss we recent financial result
those of you who have be keep up with we press_release know that we have be extraordinarily active in the month since we last update with many exciting accomplishment and even more milestone we look forward to in the upcoming month
let I start first with a few word about the enormous challenge we be all face as a result of the covid-19_pandemic which in just a few month have exact a tremendous human and economic toll on we industry on we nation and on we Board
I hope and pray that all of you be weather the level of storm as best you can and be keep yourselve and you love one safe
I be deeply move that many of you have take the time to reach out to we to express you support and continue confidence in we as well as to express you concern for we safety and health
thankfully all member of the pavmed family include we employee and critical partner be healthy safe and able to continue they important work
we be very fortunate that we corporate structure and culture be well suit to address these challenge with minimal short-term and no anticipated long-term disruption to we strategic plan
for example we employee and partner be already disperse over many state across the nation and be already proficient and productively utilize modern remote collaboration tool which they have be do since we inception
in addition we team have always embrace a sort of special force type culture as all member able to operate autonomously when necessary and spontaneously collaborate to address short-term challenge as they arise while still systematically advance and execute on we long-term strategic plan
before provide you with update on we product portfolio I would like to give you a general summary of how each area of we business have or have not be affect by the pandemic and how we be respond for those that be affect
first financial and administrative perspective
as we previously announce and as Dennis will explain in more detail shortly we recently complete the November 2019 convertible note financing which strengthen we balance_sheet and enable we to fund we full strategic plan for the foreseeable future as we advance through upcome milestone
we be also confident that we will be able to continue to finance we operation as require until we begin to generate meaningful revenue through commercial sale or non-dilutive financing through m&a activity
we executive leadership team have implement a cash management plan focus on preserve cash in area where activity be inevitably throttle as a result of the lockdown
we full-time headcount remain lean we employee and the unique expertise they bring to we effort be understandably we most critical resource that we do not plan to trim payroll
this make we eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program within the federal stimulus package
we have already complete the application and if approve will result in proceeds of approximately $ 300,000 structure as a forgivable loan
on the product development and manufacturing side we currently utilize over a dozen partner across the U.S. in the design development testing and manufacture of we product
all these partner be designate essential service remain fully operational with no meaningful disruption in they activity on we behalf
we supply_chain have also remain intact and we believe it will continue to do so without any disruption
the only component we source outside of the U.S. be electrical part of we carpx device we source in China
although we already have sufficient inventory of these part to get we through initial carpx commercialization these manufacturer be already back online follow a short covid-19 disruption earlier this year
what about on the regulatory front
we with the help of we regulatory consultant have multiple active engagement with the U.S. FDA include for CarpX PortIO EsoGuard and EsoCheck
we also have the FDA
I be happy to report that none of this work have be materially impact by covid-19
we regulatory consultant be fully operational use remote collaboration tool the FDA reviewer assign to we product be also work remotely and base on ongoing informal communication appear to have a bandwidth to work on we application
some initial concern that assign staff would be divert to covid-19-related work have not materialize
most importantly we have not receive any formal or informal indication that we should expect any covid-19-related delay in the review process
two area where we have have to actively manage covid-19-related disruption be we commercial and clinical research activity
on the commercial side the fundamental challenge that we and essentially all medical device company be currently face be that the health care system be obviously overwhelm by the pandemic
the system have be force to divert resource and drastically modify operation to care for covid-19 patient while protect health care worker
Nonemergency care include surgical and diagnostic procedure have essentially come to a standstill
although we can not predict when the engine will start-up again it be reasonable to assume that non-covid-19 health care will be among the first thing to come back online since one can not and definitely defer necessary but nonemergency procedure
I will discuss we EsoGuard commercial activity later but I be proud to report that Shaun O'Neil we Chief Commercial Officer and he team have rapidly adapt to the situation on the ground in pretty remarkable way
recruitment of independent sale rep have be unaffected and they sale training have actually move virtual without miss a beat
so as sale call with physician who be which be also be hold virtually
many of the target physician be in fact well position to participate in virtual sale call because they be work from home or from they office use telemedicine and be not necessarily on the front line of the covid-19
they mention another area that we be manage be we clinical research activity
Life science company face the same challenge with clinical research activity as with commercial activity
nearly all non covid-related clinical research have come to a grind halt nationwide include intramural academic research trial and corporate-sponsored trial by large and small company
we have active or soon to be active clinical trial involve multiple product include EsoGuard EsoCheck and PortIO which be affect by this freeze
I will update these individually a bit later
although for the time be patient can not be enrol and procedure can not be perform we clinical research team lead by Randy Brown have do a similarly remarkable job of make sure that we continue to advance the ball where we can so that we be poise to make up for lose time when thing eventually open up again
for example all of these study we for all of these study we continue to work with irb on protocol approval and with medical center on negotiating and execute clinical trial agreement
some principal investigator continue to actually actively recruit patient so they be ready to officially enroll once we be back online
let 's go through some of we recent accomplishment and upcome activity and milestone
let I start by highlight some of these
in December we majority own subsidiary Lucid Diagnostics launch we EsoGuard esophageal dna test as the first and only commercially available dna test to facilitate the detection of Barrett 's esophagus with or without dysplasia as well as the esophageal cancer
in January we launch multicenter clinical trial to support future regulatory clearance of EsoGuard and EsoCheck as a fda-registered In-Vitro Diagnostic or IVD
the first patient be enrol and undergo they procedure in February
also in January we hold a successful presubmission meeting with the FDA on we portio product focus on the design of a clinical safety study in support of a de novo application
February bring many additional lucid accomplishment
we be excite to receive FDA breakthrough device designation for EsoGuard and EsoCheck which in addition to validate they potential life-saving impact provide priority expedite FDA assessment and review and potentially accelerate CMS coverage
we enter into successful sorry we enter into sponsor clinical research agreement with major academic center the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle Washington and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia to evaluate EsoCheck in both Barrett 's Esophagus progression and eosinophilic esophagitis
we also announce a new product we EsoCure Esophageal ablation device a disposable single-use thermal balloon ablation catheter which be design to use we patented Caldus Technology to treat this dysplastic Barrett 's before it can progress to highly lethal esophageal cancer and to do so without the need for complex and expensive capital equipment
we also participate in successful meeting with the Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA and its molecular diagnostic program moldx one in February focus on EsoGuard payment and another 2 week ago focus on EsoGuard coverage
in March the FDA accept we 510 -lrb- k -rrb- resubmission for CarpX for we carpx minimally invasive carpal tunnel device incorporate datum from we first from we successful first-in-human carpx clinical safety study
also in March EsoCheck be honor as a silver winner of the Edison award
this month we complete training of we first cohort of highly experienced independent gastroenterology sale representative cover a large swath of the country who be now actively engage with longtime physician partner on EsoGuard and EsoCheck
and just yesterday despite the pandemic and a massive regulatory backlog in Europe due to systematic change we receive a firm date in June for the stage 1 audit of we quality system by we EU notify body which allow we to restart we effort to pursue EU CE Mark clearance of carpx and portio
finally as always we continue to expand and advance we extensive intellectual property portfolio which now include issue and pend patent assign or license to PAVmed and its subsidiary
and we continue to have the success of secure allowance and advance prosecution
we have many key upcoming activity and milestone for we to look forward to in the coming month
here be a few highlight
we expect to receive a response from the FDA on we carpx 510 -lrb- k -rrb- resubmission sometime during they 90-day substantive review window which extend into June
despite the limitation impose by covid-19 we will be accelerate and expand we commercial activity for EsoGuard include virtual sale and professional education as well as aggressive marketing target physician and patient to strengthen brand recognition generate awareness of underlying condition and support the sale process
we will continue to aggressively pursue we discussion with Palmetto GBA and other Medicare contractor and hope to secure payment and coverage decision for EsoGuard 's CPT code as soon as possible
once the covid-19 limitation begin to receive we will restart both we commercial and clinical esoguard procedure and enrollment in we ivd clinical trial
we will also launch additional clinical trial involve EsoCheck and PortIO which be currently on hold
we also have several very active m&a and partnership discussion involve NextFlo EsoGuard EsoCheck and DisappEAR which I will describe in more detail later but which we hope to consummate in the coming month
finally we still hope to achieve a critical accuracy milestone and benchmark in animal testing of we majority own subsidiary Solys Diagnostics noninvasive laser-based blood glucose diagnostic device
now I would like to now proceed to some more specific update across we division GI Health minimally invasive intervention Infusion therapy and emerge innovation
we GI Health division be build a portfolio of complementary product design to diagnose and treat condition of the esophagus include a spectrum of condition arise from chronic heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease lead to esophageal cancer as well as a prevalent inflammatory condition call eosinophilic esophagitis
two product EsoGuard and EsoCheck be commercially available
we hope to commercialize another product EsoCare in
in addition there be other potential pipeline product which be the subject of active research program within this division
now let 's start with esoguard and esocheck
we continue to make excellent progress on these groundbreaking product less than 2 year after license they from we partner at Case Western Reserve University
EsoGuard and EsoCheck be design to facilitate early detection of condition lead to esophageal cancer in patient with chronic heartburn
it be important to understand these that these condition lie in a spectrum
so chronic heartburn can lead to benign change in the surface cell of they lower esophagus of Barrett 's esophagus which can transform into precancerous change or dysplasia which in turn can lead to highly lethal esophageal cancer
these be truly groundbreaking product
the National Cancer Institute highlight they as one of the_year 's significant advancement in cancer 's prevention in its report progress
and as I mention the FDA grant breakthrough device designation which validate its potential life-saving impact
and EsoCheck as I mention be also recently recognize as a game-changing innovation and among the best new medical device product of the_year by the Edison award honor Thomas Edison
so briefly how do they work
EsoCheck be a fda-cleared cell collection device which can perform target and protect sampling of cell from the lining of the lower esophagus as part of a 5-minute noninvasive office-based procedure
it serve as a alternative to a invasive upper endoscopy perform under anesthesia in a hospital or dedicate endoscopy center
EsoGuard be a highly accurate next generation sequencing diagnostic assay which detect methylation change of site on gene which occur in patient along with Barrett 's Esophagus to esophageal cancer spectrum
EsoGuard have perform on sample collect with esocheck and be commercially available in the United_States as a laboratory develop test or ldt
although professional society practice guideline recommend screening in over 10 million high-risk gerd patient to detect and treat Barrett 's before it progress to cancer fewer than 10_% actually undergo screening use invasive upper endoscopy
the tragedy of these condition be that the vast majority of patient diagnose with esophageal cancer be not aware that they have underlie Barrett 's and that the progression of cancer could have be prevent through careful monitoring and treatment if the Barrett 's have be diagnose earlier
sadly over 80 % of these esophageal cancer patient will die within 5 year of diagnosis
base on very modest penetration of U.S. GERD patient currently recommend for Barrett 's screening accord to publish guideline and on a Deloitte market assessment we commission we believe that the estimate addressable domestic market opportunity for these product be several billion dollar
the most important update for these product be on the commercial front
we be commercialize EsoGuard use a hybrid model with internal sale management marketing and professional education work closely with independent sale representative across the country
and in addition to Shaun O'Neil we Chief Commercial Officer we have hire outstanding regional sale manager cover the Eastern and Western U.S. and a fantastic director of Marketing and Communications
as I previously mention last week we complete training of the first cohort these highly experienced sale rep cover most of the country
they be all senior professional average at least a dozen year in the field call on physician on behalf of well-established lead company in the space
most bring deep long stand relationship with gastroenterologist in they territory
they currently have access to they physician through virtual sale call despite the lockdown and we be confident they will be first in line once thing open up
several account that complete training have product on the shelf have perform procedure on patient before the shutdown of nonemergency procedure
since then we sale team have be in discussion with well over account who will be in a excellent position to begin perform procedure once thing open up
as I mention earlier we have initiate a aggressive marketing campaign of the professional journal and social media target physician and patient to strengthen EsoGuard and EsoCheck brand recognition
engagement with these activity have be excellent and the feedback have be very positive
we be also make solid progress on the reimbursement and coverage front
as we have previously mention EsoGuard receive a CPT code last_year
we successfully advance it through CMS process
we be grant gap-fill designation which permit we to proceed with payment and coverage discussion with designate Medicare contractor and private payer
as I mention we have successful meeting with Palmetto GBA and MolDx
we be work with we consultant to finalize a detailed dossier in support outcome
there be many additional exciting development and future activity in this division
as I mention we be excite about the progress we be make on a EsoCure ablation device
this as I mention be the disposable single-use thermal balloon ablation catheter design to advance through the work channel of a standard endoscope and use we patented Caldus Technology to ablate the esophageal tissue
once clear and commercialize EsoCure will allow physician to treat dysplastic Barrett 's before it could progress to cancer and do so without the need for complex and expensive capital equipment like current technology from Medtronic and other do
we expect to complete development and FDA 510 -lrb- k -rrb- submission to be secure by early 2021 and hope to have it commercialize later that year
as previously note we have launch these international multicenter clinical trial esoguard-be-1 and be-2 to support future pma submission for FDA registration of esoguard and esocheck as ivd
one of the study be a screening study of high-risk gerd patient and the other be a case-control study of patient with known Barrett 's or a more advanced condition
we have over site in the U.S. and Europe
clinical trial enrollment have pause after the first patient be enrol and undergo procedure last month
we have a couple of patient schedule for later this month but do not expect to be in full swing until clinical activity resume in the come week and month across the country and in Europe
meanwhile we clinical research team be continue to secure IRB approval and complete contract so we can make up for lose time when thing open up
as I mention we have other additional EsoCheck clinical trial on hold with Fred Hutch one and the one with the University of Pennsylvania and they be both we look forward to advance those as thing open up
finally we have active partnership discussion involve GI Health product
we have a strong interest from a established diagnostic company outside the U.S. to perform and market EsoGuard in that region
we also have be offer the opportunity to license highly accurate eosinophilic esophagitis biomarker from a major academic medical center for commercialization as a ldt
I expect this license agreement to be consummate soon
let 's move on to minimally invasive intervention and we CarpX product
carpx be we patented single use disposable minimally invasive device design to treat carpal tunnel syndrome while reduce recovery time
the balloon catheter device be insert under the scar ligament tension it while push the nerve and tendon away
when activate bipolar radiofrequency electrode precisely cut a ligament from the inside out in a matter of seconds
we believe CarpX will dramatically reduce recovery time compare to traditional open surgery target a estimate $ 1 billion immediately addressable domestic market opportunity
we be seek FDA 510 -lrb- k -rrb- clearance to commercially market CarpX for minimally invasive carpal tunnel release
the FDA recommend a clinical safety study to support -lrb- k -rrb- resubmission and we consult closely with they during the development of the study protocol
as we have previously announce the clinical safety study be successfully complete and incorporate into a -lrb- k -rrb- submission which be currently under FDA review
briefly carpal tunnel syndrome patient in New Zealand undergo successful CarpX minimally invasive carpal tunnel release
all patient meet the study 's prespecified effectiveness endpoint which be clinical device technical success define as the endoscopic confirmation of complete division of the transverse carpal ligament
carpx consistently cut the ligament clearly and precisely without evidence of thermal spread beyond the target tissue cutline
procedure time fall after a short learning curve indicate that the procedure can be perform in the same or less time as traditional open surgery
two week and 90-day postoperative follow-up rate be 100 % and 95 % respectively exceed the target 80 % rate recommend by the FDA
the only loss to follow-up be a patient who be document to be back to normal with resolution symptom at 6 week
he opt not to return to the study site for he 90-day follow-up visit because he be travel a significant distance away and be overall satisfied with the procedure 's outcome
all patient who complete follow-up meet the study 's prespecified primary safety endpoint which be define as device safety with no serious device-related adverse event
patient undergo additional prespecified outcome assessment at baseline and during postoperative follow-on visit
these assessment use well-established standardized and validate measure to assess patient satisfaction as well as change in symptom motor and sensory function and neurophysiologic parameter follow the procedure
the excellent result of these prespecified outcome assessment follow carpx be similar to or better-than-expected result from traditional open surgery
since the FDA accept we -lrb- k -rrb- resubmission application we have receive some informal communication with they and look forward to they formal response this_quarter during the 90-day substantive review window which extend to June
now next some brief highlight from we Infusion therapy division which include portio and NextFlo
portio be we implantable intraosseus vascular access device which allow direct access to the bone marrow to deliver medication fluid and other substance
we be seek a initial short-term implant duration indication through the FDA 's de novo pathway
in January we participate in a successful presubmission meeting with the FDA focus on the clinical protocol for a single for a small single center clinical safety study in New Zealand and on the target population in we propose label
the short-term clinical safety study as well as a long-term study we have plan to perform in Colombia South America be both on hold due to travel and clinical limitation
we be continue with the necessary administrative work so we can proceed immediately to training and enrollment once these once thing open up
and we be also explore whether it might be advantageous to move the clinical safety study to the U.S. as a ide study
we NextFlo infusion system just a brief comment about that
this system deliver highly accurate gravity-driven infusion independent of the height of the iv bag and seek to eliminate the need for complex and expensive electronic infusion pump for most of the estimate million infusion deliver in the United_States each day
we be successfully advance the NextFlo infusion test through design control development and testing with the goal of a 510 -lrb- k -rrb- submission later this year
a exciting development that arise from M&A discussion with key strategic in the space have be a expansion of the application use NextFlo as a platform technology
these be application that we have always contemplate and be now pursue at the request of these strategic
these application include disposable infusion pump for home use package drug infusion military and pharma application and intravenous nutrition
we M&A discussion remain active with several large company in the space and we look forward to consummate a deal as soon as possible
I wish I have more time to update you on exciting project we be work on in we emerge innovation division again a few brief highlight
we disappear resorbable pediatric tube which be manufacture from aqueous silk and seek to revolutionize the care of the estimate 1 million child who undergo bilateral ear tube placement each year
we be very close to secure a commercial development and manufacturing relationship with a large multinational company which have develop expertise and processing scope for commercial use
they technique allow the ear tube to be injection mold instead of machine which greatly enhance the commercial potential of this product
and then as I briefly mention we in we subsidiary Solys Diagnostics the research and development plan for we noninvasive laser-based blood glucose monitor technology be progress very well and we expect to complete bench top and animal testing in the come week
we emerge innovation team be also work on several exciting product include product in the ECMO cardiopulmonary support and ventilation area
both of these area be highly relevant to the treatment of covid-19 patient and other respiratory condition
I will now pass the mic on to Dennis for a review of we financial result
thanks Lishan and good afternoon everyone
I will be brief as we financial result for the_quarter and year end December 31 , 2019 be report in we press_release that be publish just prior to the beginning of this call
we annual report on form 10-k will be available at sec.gov and we website early next week
the complexity involve with accounting for the noncash charge relate to we fourth quarter convertible debt financing couple with lawyer auditor consultant and staff work remotely make the extension unavoidable
you will recall that even as late as just last week we complete the second half of the November 2019 financing which Lishan speak to which also impact the related registration statement that be file in December and amend on March 30
the elongate registration process be impact in part by the SEC 's availability challenge as they be work at home as well
nonetheless the financial result I will be provide today be consistent with the preliminary result report on March 30 as available to you and report on form 12b-25 extension file at that time
so with regard to the financial result research and development expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 be $ 2.3 million up from about $ 1.4 million for the same period in and about $ 700,000 higher sequentially
the year-over-year increase reflect incremental hiring of Chief Medical Officer Chief
operate Officer and Engineer PAVmed as well as clinical trial-related expense many of which Lishan just go through for carpx and particularly EsoGuard be the early setup cost for the ivd clinical trial begin in earnest in the_fourth_quarter
General and administrative expense be $ 2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compare with $ 1.9 million for the same period in and be higher by about $ 600,000 sequentially
the sequential increase reflect the financing transaction cost in the_fourth_quarter related to the November convertible debt financing
the year-over-year increase reflect a increase in compensation-related cost particularly stock-based compensation increase IP legal cost and a increase in Investor Relations activity
pavm report a net loss attributable to common stockholder of $ 6.3 million or a loss of $ 0.19 per common share
however we press_release provide substantially more detail related to the noncash charge occur in the current and prior period
also the press_release provide a table entitle Non - gaap measure which highlight these amount along with interest expense and other noncash charge like depreciation stock-based compensation financing-related cost should enable you to have a better understanding of the company 's financial performance
you will notice from the table that after adjust the gaap loss by these charge the company report a non-gaap adjusted loss for the 3 month end December 31 of $ 3.9 million or about $ 0.12 per common share
pavm have cash of $ 6.2 million as of December 31 , 2019
subsequent to the year-end and just last week the company receive net proceeds of approximately $ 6 million from the prepayment of the investor note receive in the November private placement transaction with institutional investor
you will recall the company enter into a series b senior secure convertible note with each of the Series A investor that give we this option for a additional $ 6 million
that funding last week be in connection with these previously announce series b investor note
we cash balance at March 31 be approximately $ 8.5 million and we be very confident that we will continue to have access to additional funding to finance we ongoing operation as need which Lishan have allude to earlier in the prepared remark
furthermore as of January 2020 we accumulatively pay down approximately $ 7.7 million of the previous December 2018 senior convertible debt which have a initial balance of just under $ 8 million at the outset and leave a remain balance of $ 50,000
so with that operator we could open it up to additional question from we audience
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from the line of Anthony Vendetti of the Maxim Group
Dennis Lishan thanks so much for do the call and also for go over the covid-19 impact across all facet of you business
seem like most of well all of you business be continue to operate
and you have be operate and they have have experience operate remotely
so that side of the business seem fine
it be the commercial side that and the delay some of the trial and so forth but that be to be expect
I be wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about CarpX
obviously this be a resubmission
so you have have a lot of conversation many conversation with the FDA over this time period
do you I mean if it be not for the covid-19 situation do you believe they would have need the full 90 day
and with the current situation be it hard to gauge whether you think they will take the full 90 day to review
or what base on you conversation with they where be they at in term of the review process
sure
that be a great question
and obviously we have to be careful about predict anything but I can make I can provide some insight that you allude to
one of they be that we have be involve with the FDA on this product
this be a resubmission as you note
and what I do mention be that we have the same lead examiner who be very supportive of we application at the beginning
so that be we be fortunate to have that that be not guarantee as you may know
so yes for the same people who work with we on develop the preclinical testing and document the lack of thermal spread and the thermal safety the preclinical setting in animal and cadaver the same people who work with we to develop the protocol for the clinical study be now review this
as I mention we do not really have any sense that they be be affect by the epidemic by the pandemic there
they acknowledge receipt
they have they quickly proceed with the acceptance checklist
I have mention we have have some informal communication that indicate that they be deep into the weed of the application
so we have have no indication that there be a slowdown
and we have always be hopeful that because and now because it be the same group that because this be a resubmission that there would be a opportunity for thing to move quickly
but there be no way we can really predict that
I mean this be the counterargument to that be that we be submit a clinical trial even though it be small and there be patient
it be a substantial amount of datum and information that they have to go through
so I would not want to presume that thing will move more quickly than normal
but I can say that I do not think we be slow down by COVID
we be very fortunate that we have the same group review it
and we have have some informal communication that indicate that they be well into they so they be deep into they review of the application
no that be very helpful Lishan
and if you could just give a little bit more color on EsoGuard in term of feedback from kol during you initial commercial launch here
how be that go
yes
sure
I mean it be be I mean I be just go to sound cheerleader-ish a little bit but it be not absolutely remarkable
I mean the feedback have be excellent
we have really solid people on the ground
we eastern sale manager be a long-time veteran of the gi space
and the people who be the independent rep who be already on the phone and on e-mail contact to doctor be have these conversation and these conversation be go very well
I mean we have they well train with objection handle to handle all the various task that these conversation can take about how it relate to they exist endoscopy business and so forth
and the feedback we be get and I receive a lot of these be that people ultimately get it
they understand that there be a opportunity here to enlarge the funnel and to bring more patient that be not in this group of sort of 90 % of the patient should be get screen who be not get screen as a way to expand the funnel and to ultimately both benefit patient and benefit they practice
the practice some of the larger practice already have a subset of they physician who run esophageal clinic they run motility and vh clinic
and any concern we have about sort of where this would fit in within they practice it be probably not material
the feedback have be yes let 's get start and let 's get roll and get these patient into these clinic
so I really can honestly say the feedback have be extremely positive
and once we once they be actually able to do procedure we expect we have to be pretty quick and substantial
yes
it be great
and so just obviously the commercial launch be go to be stall by covid-19 do you think there will be some pent-up demand as you be have these conversation
yes
no definitely
yes
it start to wrap
but yes exactly
that be the point I be try to get across which be that there be still a lot of activity
and because of the exist relationship of these rep they be able to pick up the phone and talk to they long-time physician colleague about this technology and begin that process
so all of that activity have really be it be somewhat affect but it be be proceed pretty aggressively
the only thing we can not do be actually procedure right
and so I think the way you describe it be exactly right but there will be pent-up demand and that will make up somewhere for lose time because of the activity that be currently ongoing
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from -lsb- Asif Ahmed -rsb-
just I want a quick follow-up on Lucid and since you guy have all the stuff line up
would there be any chance you do not have to go into detail if there something be confidential obviously but any chance that you guy be spin off run Lucid as a separate entity
I mean have there be any plan or anything
we just want to obviously many of the guy that I be work with they would like to know and be really interested in if there be anything you can say that that be obviously safe and secure to say
that be a great question and it be one that be a frequent inquiry make of we
and so I be not go to answer you question very specifically because it be a strategic plan that the Board will mull over continuously
I be go to give you a more broad answer
we plan this_year include a bunch of activity that Lishan thoroughly go through that we will modulate we burn rate from where it be now and where be the clinical trial once they ramp up
and there be many access point for we to finance that business
we can finance as we have at the parent level
we can finance with debt
we have be creative with that
fortunately we would evolve to a level of sophistication that the early day of PAVmed 's immaturity have different type of financing structure
one as you suggest be a financing inside the subsidiary in whatever form that take private or public financing
it be a tool a proceeds from a M&A transaction on one of we asset and revenue for the second half
so you question although I can not specifically answer because no firm decision have be make about that the ability to finance inside a subsidiary and treat that as its own separate entity
right_now we look at this as a single segment with division
but what you be suggest be something that could be available to we in the_future
and as it continue to evolve we will be opportunistic that and take action in best interest of shareholder
we next question 's come from the line of -lsb- Robert Wileman -rsb-
it be in regard to I believe there be a provision in the latest round of convertible note that speak about the requirement of a sale of a asset by the end of June to provide a source of nondilutive financing
be that something that we expect to still come to fruition
be that a provision that be that could be sort of renegotiate if a acceptable term for sale of a asset do not present themselves
just could you provide as much context as you can around that
yes sure thing
let I expand you comment just a bit to add context
when we complete the engage in the November financing you will recall there be piece of that puzzle
the Series A financing be note that we get receive $ 7 million
and the Series B that be a additional $ 7 million of debt $ 6.3 million of net proceeds
available option to we that have prerequisite condition to be achieve one of they be what you just outline that a nondilutive financing at a certain level would occur before a certain date
and that condition be waive as indicate by the financing last week
I mean investor be so delighted with the progress of the company the continued involvement of we value but we waive that condition
now that be not a indication that we have lose sight of that
as Lishan indicate in he remark we be actively engage in M&A related activity include we NextFlo with multiple party
so although we be not prepare to speak specifically to that at this point rest assure there be ongoing discussion relate to that
so hopefully that answer you question
it do
that be helpful
and in term of NextFlo be we be talk with multiple party and I would imagine gauge they interest
in the background be we also progress towards the FDA clearance for that device where presumably the value of that would go up substantially
yes
sorry I be not clear about that
I do try to mention that in my comment
so the answer be yes
the way the best way to understand that be to think of NextFlo as a platform technology as I mention with multiple application
so the application that we have always focus on and the one that be the center of most of we commentary be this infusion set to replace electronic infusion pump
and that product be in fact as you ask advance through we design control development process and we be look to have submission to the FDA before the end of the year
so that be move along and we be definitely keep the party that we be talk to inform about that
what be interesting be that they would come back to we and express interest in these other application beyond the infusion set new patient refuse to that
and it be because of they inquiry around this that we have start to pursue these other application which be disposable infusion pump and particularly that and the prefil drug infusion
and that be actually enhance we ability to have these conversation
so the way this ultimately could evolve would be that we enter into agreement that start with particular application with milestone or time line that extend for other application
and even in theory have multiple transaction with different party where we be license or they be acquire the technology for certain application
do that make sense
but yes the simple answer be we absolutely be move the product along both because we would like to eventually commercialize they but also as you say because that do in fact enhance the value
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from the John Levin of Levin Capital
Lishan Dennis congratulation on all you be do it be really terrific
the presentation be wonderful
EsoGuard and EsoCheck I be outside so it be hard to hear I forgive I
we can hear you fine
we can hear you fine sorry
why be you not able to sell any what
but I guess that do not happen right
why be you not able to okay
why be you not able to sell any of it yet
I understand COVID be a impediment but be there some technical reason that you be in pre-K
you may have say and I miss it
what be the impediment to get -lsb- indiscernible -rsb- sale
yes
the impediment be simply that there be no procedure be perform
so for we to effectively sell EsoGuard and EsoCheck the physician have to perform a procedure get a sample send the sample to procedure be perform there be no sort of stock inventory right_now
it be just we have to wait for procedure to come up
so we be build up demand
there be no doubt about that
and once we be thing open up so we will be able to sell it
yes
Perfect
I understand
I would have assume for they most vulnerable or they most favorite patient they would have say oh sneak into we office and we will get one do to you
yes there really be none of that right_now
I mean we have actually have some creative conversation about move they with equipment as car pass by and so forth
but for all classical purpose it have to wait till that comeback
but do not come back sooner than you might think because you can not wait forever
I understand
I be just try to make sure there be no regulatory or procedural or some kind of
no no no
not at all
we be off to the race and then thing come to a hold
yes
well let I follow that up if I may
when you be offer the race in patient what percentage of the how many when you be at the race how many horse run
and what be the result with the horse that run
yes
we be just get start
so we only have a handful of patient at site before we before thing shut_down
but those case go fine
those physician and they staff be train
they be able to perform the procedure
the sample be send
so everything be successful in that regard
but it be only a handful before the elective procedure start to end
but as I mention we have over we be in contact with well over maybe close to account right_now as we speak
so those conversation be they be priming and gear up to go once thing open up
we have reach the end of the question-and-answer session
I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remark
thank you all for join this afternoon and for you question
we look forward to keep you apprise of we progress via we news release and periodic conference call such as this one encourage you to continue to stay in contact which many of you have with Mike directly with any question at jmh@pavmed.com

I would now like to turn the conference over to we host Chief_Executive_Officer Mark Newcomer
please go ahead
thank you Diego
good afternoon everyone and thank you for join we for a discussion about we full year financial result
I be Mark Newcomer the President and Chief_Executive_Officer of PaySign
with I this afternoon be Mark Attinger we Chief_Financial_Officer
before I begin my commentary on the business I would like to address the delay in the filing of we k
the delay in we filing be due to several round of auditor request for additional datum which take number we report on March 16
Mark can touch on this in more detail during he discussion
I be very pleased to be able to deliver strong result for the full-year performance even with the miss related to we revenue guidance
for the full year we revenue be a record $ 34.7 million a increase of 48 % compare to the_prior_year
we full-year net income be up 188 % or $ 7.5 million also a record and we adjusted ebitda be 10.1 % a increase of 106 %
I be very happy with these result and extremely proud of we team and they contribution towards we continued growth
we experience strong growth in we exist industry vertical and as we expand into new vertical
in we build out a new business line add new card program include in plasma in pharma and other card program
and we now have in excess of 2.9 million cardholder on we platform
I be especially please with the revenue growth in we pharmaceutical program which increase from $ 366,000 to over $ 7.3 million in just 1 year
with new opportunity open in the space we have expand beyond we long-standing pharmaceutical payment offering and establish the patient affordability business line to include other service require by we hub service client
these new service include pharmacy base co-pay , medical claim processing and payment , centralized billing and payment service as well as other product
you will be hear the term hub from we quite often move forward as we grow this business line
so to define hub hub service provider be company that pharmaceutical manufacturer use to maintain a connection with the patient during all phase of the prescription delivery process
over the past few year there have be a consolidation of hub service provider
the consolidation in the industry have turn ally company into competitor therefore create a opportunity for we to provide these new offering to hub service provider that lack or choose not to provide these service in-house
in response to this opportunity we have make the decision to increase we capability to cater to these hub service provider with program currently onboard and perform to initial expectation
over the course of the past year we have continue to build out this business line and have onboard new personnel to meet the need of this unique market
this represent a substantial investment into new software development architecture and human capital
draw from industry experience we design develop and deploy a best-in-class solution to meet the need of we patient affordability partner
these enhance capability will further we reach into the patient affordability space and allow we to onboard new client for multiple sector
we have continue to build out and strengthen we entire team here at PaySign
in the latter part of we also increase the bench strength of we executive team with the addition of Matt Lanford as we Chief Product Officer and Kim Sergent as we Chief Marketing Officer
they have be instrumental in create new product feature and functionality for we client as well as refreshing we brand
I be very pleased to have they as part of we team
I would like to touch for a moment now on covid-19 and would like to reiterate that we highest priority remain the safety of we employee cardholder and customer
we have take immediate action to protect we people customer and business by execute on we business continuity plan
to we especially important be the main sector we serve be crucial to the health and well-being of the general public
we have implement measure to manage potential disruption in meantime real-time communication across entire organization with we client and cardholder
to date there have be no work stoppage and no employee test positive for covid-19
of course we will continue to monitor this situation very closely
the impact of covid-19 to we business so far have be minimal with no apparent effect on we pharma and patient affordability business line which continue to see excellent growth and only a slight impact to we plasma business
however we be expect at this time to see a continued growth year-over year in the plasma business
on March 19 , 2020 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security release the guidance document that enumerate source plasma donation and pharmaceutical supply as part of the critical infrastructure
plasma donation center have be classify as be within the category of essential critical infrastructure health care and pharmaceutical supply that be exempt from general lockdown or closure directive
look forward to the other side of the pandemic thing
First be that we expect the economic fallout from the pandemic will lead to a increase in the number of donor as donor compensation can bring a extra $ 500 a month to frequent donor
and secondly if plasma collect from people with the covid-19 antibody be find to be a component of any therapy that would treat the virus we would expect to see a sizable increase in the number of plasma donation both from the current donor demographic and the general public
look ahead we will continue to broaden and diversify we market focus for we card program and we will seek to introduce new product
we be develop new business-to-business solution enhance we customer web and mobile application and build new pharma patient affordability offering
we expect continued growth in pharma and plasma and to continue to expand it to new market
with regard to PaySign Premier we continue to refine the product that be offer through one of we plasma client
to date we have minimize we marketing expense for the Premier Card as we have choose to deploy the majority of we focus and resource on the expansion of the previously mention initiative
lastly we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunity in
we have evaluate several candidate to date
however there be nothing definitive to share at this time
before I turn it over I would like to address the question of Dan Henry
as you all know Mr. Henry have serve as we Chairman and as a Independent Director since
on March 25 it be announce that Mr. Henry be appoint Chief_Executive_Officer President and as a Board Member at Green Dot Corporation
after a discussion with the PaySign Board and Mr. Henry it be unanimously decide there would be no change to Mr. Henry 's status with the company
Mr. Henry remain with paysign as we Chairman and as a Independent Director
at this time I would like to turn it over to we CFO Mark Attinger who will take we through the number in more detail and will touch briefly on SOX -lrb- b -rrb-
thank you Mark
so I be go to take we through the full year result provide some variance commentary touch on SOX -lrb- b -rrb- and give you some insight into quarter 1 performance
and digest we earnings and the 10-k I be sure you have notice we have disaggregate revenue a bit and enhance we commentary
as I proceed reference to year-on-year improvement or percentage change unless state otherwise refer to the full year 2019 as compare to
revenue for the_year end December 31 , 2019 be $ 34,666,653 a increase of 48.0 % compare to the $ 23,423,675 the_prior_year
revenue consist of $ 27.0 million or 78 % in support of the plasma industry $ 7.4 million or 21 % pharma and $ 0.3 million or 1 % in other revenue
although quarter 4 dollar load to card perform as expect the revenue conversion rate on plasma of 3.42 % be down from 3.80 % in q3
this unexpected degradation combine with lighter pharma spend contribute to the full year revenue shortfall versus guidance
Gross profit increase 68.8 % to $ 19.3 million or 55.5 % of revenue compare to $ 11.4 million and 48.7 % of revenue in
this basis point improvement be drive primarily to favorable mix towards higher-margin card program
the operating_expense be $ 13.1 million a increase of 47.2 % versus $ 8.9 million in
the increase consist primarily of $ 2.5 million in salary and benefit $ 1.1 million in stock-based compensation and a $ 0.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization
benefit from higher card balance interest income be $ 441,000 compare to $ 140,000 the_prior_year
net income for the_year be $ 7,454,319 or $ 0.16 per basic share a increase of 188.0 % compare to $ 2,588,054 or $ 0.06 per basic share the_prior_year
fully dilute be $ 0.14 per share compare to $ 0.05
non-gaap adjusted ebitda be $ 10,114,980 or $ 0.21 per basic share a increase of 106.2 % compare to $ 4,904,781 or $ 0.11 per share at the_prior_year
furthermore the adjusted ebitda margin improve to 29.2 % up basis_point from 20.9 % in
we load $ 859 million load to the card versus $ 621 million the_prior_year and we revenue conversion rate of gross dollar volume load on card be 4.04 % or basis_point compare to 3.77 % or basis point the_prior_year
I would also like to point out that we near final 2020 first quarter pharma net dollar load to card increase approximately 70 % versus quarter 1 2019 and increase 275 % versus the prior quarter load
this illustrate both the seasonal nature of pharma business and the significant year-on-year growth
from a balance sheet perspective consolidated cash include restricted cash have increase 43.9 % or $ 13.9 million to $ 45.6 million compare to $ 31.7 million at year-end
as a point of reference and a seasonal peak for we current program consolidated cash at February month end be $ 61.6 million
also although we have not complete we reconciliation we expect we quarter-ending consolidated cash to be approximately $ 54 million to $ 55 million include unrestricted cash of approximately $ 9.5 million consistent with year-end
working capital increase to $ 13.6 million compare to $ 5.9 million at December 31 , 2018
the $ 7.7 million improvement be due primarily to increase consolidated cash partially offset by a increase in the card funding liability
we liquidity as measure by a adjusted current ratio exclude restricted cash and cardholder fund from both side of the balance_sheet respectively reflect x coverage at year end 2019 up from x at
I would like to speak for a moment regard Sarbanes-Oxley -lrb- b -rrb-
at the end of quarter we market cap result in be classify as a accelerate filer and subject to a independent audit of we internal control of we financial reporting i.e. the -lrb- b -rrb-
the objective of Sarbanes-Oxley and the COSO framework be to make sure that you process and control help to prevent any inaccuracy in you financial reporting
so in preparation we bring in a third-party advisory firm as many company do to aid we in prepare for -lrb- b -rrb-
subsequently paysign and we auditor identify material weakness over internal control for financial reporting
we take this very seriously and have take immediate step to remediate the identify weakness
we add staff to aid in the assessment
we implement a appropriate separation of responsibility
we improve we documentation and have strengthen the process with respect to system user access and change control
we will continue to make improvement during
please refer to Item 9a of the 10-k for more information
in the light of the identify control weakness the auditor be extra diligent in they assessment of the financial audit lead to a extended duration
this result in the completion of we third year with we current auditor
and once again the audit opinion state the financial statement present fairly in all material respect the financial position of the company as of December 31 , 2019
and the opinion further state result of operation 's cash_flow be in conformity with generally accept accounting principle
also for those of you interested in look more closely at quarter we financial result of course do roll therefore full year less September year-to-date do reflect we q4 earnings and financial activity
as we look to we will refrain from issue revenue guidance at this time to allow for a further evaluation of covid-19 and any impact on we business
pharma and plasma be both defensive in nature as we ceo have state plasma have be deem critical infrastructure
we do expect to benefit from continue revenue growth and also similar gross margin to
we also expect to experience moderate opex growth as we continue to make select and sound investment in we sale technology and operation capability
although we have not complete we month-end and quarter-end closing procedure for the_first_quarter we do anticipate revenue of approximately $ 10.4 million to $ 10.5 million up 43 % to 45 % versus $ 7.3 million the_prior_year
I think that conclude my remark at this time
I be go to turn it back over to we moderator to begin a question-and-answer session
thank you
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb-
we first question come from Peter Heckmann with Davidson
what in term of the revenue conversion rate issue you talk about that pop up in the_fourth_quarter can you give we a little bit more background on that
and anything that may have change in term of mix and how that what that imply for the next couple of quarter
yes
Pete thank you for the question
so that revenue conversion rate that I quote be specifically plasma
and we see a significantly lower revenue conversion rate for the new center we bring on in the September 30 all of those turn up at the same time
we do see the load that we be expect in fact q4 load be up a little more than 20_% versus the plasma q3 load
but the conversion rate on those due to the behavior of those particular customer and where they be located lead to less interchange revenue and cardholder transaction fee revenue
we have not be able to evaluate that just yet since we be in we closing procedure for first quarter to see how that may have change
we expect that to improve as those performance and we do actually make some change with we partner in banking in Mexico that should help with we overall gross margin on those center put in place a bilateral agreement to improve the cost of ATM transaction that will help with the gross margin on those
but beyond that I can not look too closely just yet at the revenue conversion rate for q1
get it
that be helpful
and then just as a follow-up question
in term of investment spend I be sure it be a little bit hard to quantify but can you talk about some of the investment spend that you have in on thing like PaySign Premier corporate loyalty generally item that do not generate much revenue
and then how you be think about that number for
so I think that we ceo have touch on new hire and the build-out of patient affordability
you also see as you look at the cash flow statement you can see we investment in capital expenditure be about $ 3.2 billion $ 3.3 million
so there be investment last_year
it be a little higher than I anticipate early in the year of about $ 2.25 million to $ 2.5 million
just to give you a little more insight as we look to we have model in capex of $ 3.2 million to $ 3.7 million
we next question come from Austin Moldow with Canaccord Genuity
of the pharma contract in how many be those still active or renew in
and how many new contract have be sign for the remainder of
and what do the pipeline look like for pharma for the rest of this_year
and if there be any impact from the virus
sure
so with respect to pharma just to give you a little bit of history we end with program
we add program in take we to
we have program that end
so we end the year 2019 with program
and in quarter we have add additional program
okay get it
and can you also repeat the q1 pharma load growth number you mention and what those growth rate exactly related to
and how you expect or I would like to understand better what you expect the cadence of pharma to be through the_year
so I be just step back up to my note
I be look back on my comment
the pharma load for q1 versus q1 increase 70 %
the load increase roughly 275 % versus the_fourth_quarter
and this be one of the thing that we have continue to reiterate with analyst and those that follow we as they ask business
as we have talk about before the pharma business tend to be seasonal since the out-of-pocket for consumer be greatest in the_first_quarter prior to have meet they deductible
and at that point you see the pharmaceutical manufacturer and we payment solution standing in and provide that assistance that co-pay assistance if you will
so as I mention the cash balance in February be $ 61 million
that tend to be a seasonal peak
last_year it hit a seasonal peak in March
this_year it appear to be at least for we current customer hit that in February
as we look forward we do have a couple of additional client that we just onboard
those will contribute to this_year
and we have several new pharma client in the pipeline actually in contracting as we speak
so we be expect some additional win on the pharma business and that the combination of onboard new client along with the slow degradation on seasonality of exist pharma business should net-net lead to strong growth on a full-year basis for pharma
we see a increase to $ 7 million and roughly 21 % of we business be pharma in
we do expect a solid growth this_year
and to give you a little bit of a flavor let I just drop back down and look at a couple of thing that I think I would share if the question arise
we be expect the full year mix to be approximately 65 % plasma 25 % to 30 % pharma and roughly 5 % to 10 % other business
Great
and sorry one last one if I could sneak it in
do you expect the pharma revenue conversion rate to stay roughly the same in
yes
do not I mean it be hard to predict
it be base on the performance of those program and exactly how each new program come on board relative to the current program
but there be nothing at the moment that indicate that it would change but I hedge a little bit up or down frankly
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb-
we next question come from Jon Hickman with Ladenburg Thalmann
so my question have to do with could you give we some idea with about the cost of the SOX 404 -lrb- b -rrb- in you audit since it be pretty extensive
I take it that will not repeat itself in q2 but could you give we some idea of what that cost you in q1
sure
so as you can probably imagine we have to engage we auditor early last year on a regular financial audit
in the middle of the year after we trip the higher market cap and become accelerate filer we sign a additional engagement where they would conduct the -lrb- b -rrb- assessment
if I be not mistaken that be somewhere around $ 70,000 incur in
and give the extended period of time that we encounter with we auditor in they up that by I believe about a additional $ 50,000 in the_first_quarter
and then the consulting
the third-party advisory firm be $ 61,500
and that be incur in
so we have try to limit that expense and go ahead
sound like you do a pretty good job
so the other question I have have be ask and answer
we next question come from Peter Heckmann with Davidson
gentleman I just want to clarify
you go through a lot of information fairly quickly
but so at the end of the first quarter it sound as if you have
in pharmaceutical payment assistance you have approximately let 's see yes really at the end of the first quarter end in the_fourth_quarter be add in the_first_quarter
number one be that correct
and then number two the pharma value load in the_first_quarter that up 70 % number that reflect the turn of cash
you kind of give we the walk but from December to March but that $ 55 million at the end of March would represent somewhere around $ 45 million $ 46 million in restricted cash
be that all correct
yes
so we end with $ 10 million on roughly excuse I we end with client you be right
and that the that be add in the_first_quarter have generate very little activity to date
so those be not really reflect in we first quarter result
and yes roughly $ 9.4 million to $ 9.5 million be unrestricted cash
so the balance be restrict on that $ 54 million $ 55 million you quote correct
okay great
and then just in term of the PaySign Premier it sound like you direct some marketing dollar to some other initiative
in term of how we see that business roll out this_year do you feel like there may be opportunity there to grow the business through other affiliate or partner
or just in term of near-term return you just you see relatively more potential on the pharma side
so as Mark state we be market it to exist customer in partnership with one of we larger client
we be continue to test it how to best and most economically drive customer conversion before expand further
however we focus have be on the kind of the larger opportunity in front of we
but we will continue to work on Premier Card also
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from Austin Moldow with Canaccord Genuity
just more please
though other revenue be still small just 1 % total revenue can you talk about what card program be in that
be it just the DDA card which mean that revenue be concentrate in q4
or be there other loyalty and incentive program in that too
yes
it be a combination of card program
it be not any single program
okay
and can you talk about how those program in other revenue do they have the same be there the same dynamic where there be loaded fund at the top and you take the revenue and there be a revenue conversion on that
and be there any color about what kind of if what kind of loaded fund be associate with those small program
so yes it be a bit of a hybrid
part of it be transaction processing that we be do on the card program
part of it have dollar load to card and a traditional kind of revenue conversion rate as you have look at we other program
okay
and last question
if you do see headwind to the top line from the virus be there any flexibility there with expense reduction
or have you test the model in a sort of worst-case scenario
yes absolutely
so definitely have do some sensitivity analysis
one of the question that we anticipate be around cash burn and cash flow
and in all of we scenario that we have look at we do anticipate be cash_flow positive
however that say we will look closely at the paycheck loan process available through the sba that the government 's announce since employer with less than employee can have access to those fund as a contingency
we be also look at other lever as consideration as well although we again expect continue positive cash_flow
thank you
there be no further question at this time
I will turn it back to management for close remark
so look it be a difficult time for we country right_now and for the world and we be all digest what be occur and how to protect we family and love one and those who we work with
with that say please make no mistake about it we remain as focus as ever on execute each day and each week in deliver valuable service to we client and customer and continue we growth and profitability
thank you again for you interest for you question and you participation in this call
and be safe and have a good evening
and Mark do you want to add to that
yes
again thank you Diego and thanks everyone for join we today and we look forward to stay in touch in future quarter
have a nice day and you all take care and stay safe out there
thank you

so normally I would get right to share with you insight on key event that have influence we most recent quarterly result
we business end the_second_quarter of_fiscal year_2020 with strong result and good momentum
we be see benefit from many of the initiative that we have be work on for the last year and we be feel pretty well position for what we think the rest of this_year would look like
then just about a couple of week into we third quarter in March the World Health Organization recognize the novel strain of coronavirus covid-19 as a pandemic
this virus have cause a global disruption that have touch every one of we in some manner include we employee and member across country
so by March it be clear to we the world have change and we focus quickly shift to main priority
so priority # 1 first and foremost and as always protect the safety and wellbeing of we employee and we member
and now more than ever in the face of this pandemic priority take additional step to ensure continued operation without disruption priority take proactive measure to protect we supply_chain priority get move quickly on key project especially those that could expand online capability and find new way to meet member demand which be change in response to this virus and priority manage cash and capital resource in the face of a much much less predictable climate
we be now into this for a little over a month
and as often happen in time of crisis and necessity we be actually find opportunity
we be push action new idea and improvement that I believe will help we shape the_future of we business in very positive way
the following be a summary of some specific action we have take in response to the COVID outbreak
so as to priority and we employee member and continue operation
we quickly off site employee whose function could be perform remotely with many of we key executive take extra precaution
this be do well before government mandate and we have be able to continue support all operation from off-site since approximately the second week of March
in February we have assemble a task force represent leadership cover all aspect of we business
this leadership team be 100 % on task and communicate 7 day a week
every day we review in detail and plan for all of the development in each of we market
Governmental authority in we market have impose or be experiment with policy or restriction affect the retail sector of we market and many of these have result in limit access for we member and impact we club operation
these limitation and restriction change day-to-day and vary from market to market
but we team stand ready to respond real-time and be nimble in find way to continue to serve we member while abide by local law and regulation
at the club level and throughout we distribution center we have implement safety protocol to protect we hero
we employee who be face-to-face with the public they be on the front line provide goods to we that we member really need
we be take preventative measure such as provide personal protective equipment for they
we be install sneeze guard for the cashier and in other member-facing area we have reduce or remove in club food service
we be eliminate food sampling we be educate we employee about best practice for good hygiene increase cleaning and sanitize protocol few
we do not allow employee to exhibit symptom or who live with people that be show symptom to come to work
and we have modify we sick leave policy to make sure that people can take pay time off without any concern about be absent
we be also prepare for the unknown
we be build reserve team who do not overlap with other employee so that they can step in as need
we report and be transparent with we employee we member and the public when we be notify of a confirm COVID case and we follow health authority guideline for quarantine and contact mapping
thankfully to date we be only aware of a few confirm case among we approximate employee and we be really do whatever we can to keep that number as low as possible
but we be get prepared if circumstance change
we third focus protect we supply_chain
we merchandising and distribution team be work with supplier to make sure item be available
and by the way I would like to also recognize and express my gratitude to we supplier and we vendor because we be really work together to get through the unexpected
we closely monitor inventory in we supply_chain and upstream
while we have experience some out of stock on certain surge item we have generally be able to maintain adequate level on a majority of the product that we member need
but that be a dynamic situation and we have to keep monitor it very carefully
and we have a contingency plan actually a couple in place in the event that a country or a region of strategic importance to we inventory flow be negatively impact by the pandemic or they be experience related restriction
we distribution center outside of the United_States especially the Costa Rica regional distribution center have play a important role in provide optionality and reduce the risk of interruption to the flow of critical merchandise to we market
we have place limit on the quantity of certain key item that member can purchase such as clean supplies paper product and core shelf stable grocery so that these essential product be available to as many member as possible
and at some club we have create dedicated shopping hour for we employee as well as for senior and other individual most at risk
we fourth focus be of course meet the demand of we member
over the last few week we have expedite we adoption of technological innovation and rapidly accelerate beta initiative that allow we member to continue to shop while reduce the need for physical contact
I be pleased to announce that we have successfully launch we online catalog that enable we member to see almost real-time the availability of product for all club
then leverage this capability and to best accommodate we member within the restriction we have already launch we first click-and-go program in Costa Rica
we member can go online look at the catalog of product in the club order they pay online drive to the club and have goods place in they car reduce almost any physical interaction with we employee
this be be roll out very quickly to we other market as well
in tandem with this we be enhance we member experience and increase we digital connection with we member through we new PriceSmart app which we member seem to like as we be see a rapid increase in the number of sign-up and renewal use the app
the talent and technology we obtain through PriceSmart 's acquisition of Aeropost have prove to play a very important role in enable these capability in this compress period of time
at some club we also provide assisted shopping which allow a member to order by phone for pick up or for delivery
we have increase we capacity for delivery by we own employee as well as through delivery service
in fact in one country where retailer be order to temporarily close the government grant PriceSmart permission to operate as a drive-through to provide pre-built basic commodity bag that we call smart bag while require minimum time or physical contact between the employee and the member
we be also work to deploy we workforce in a thoughtful manner include by develop a program to teach employee skill so that they can support we effort to provide member with additional alternative way to shop
PriceSmart be also work with nonprofit include price philanthropy to provide these basic commodity smart bag to people in need and to support the community in which we operate
I be so incredibly proud of how we team have quickly adapt and be creatively respond to the challenge we be face while prepare for what might be next
we fifth focus cash management
give the uncertainty surround the potential impact of the outbreak on we result of operation and cash_flow we be proactively take step to access and preserve cash available on hand
we have also decide to delay certain capital expenditure
we plan to complete the construction of we warehouse club in Liberia Costa Rica next month but we postpone its opening
with respect to we previously announce future warehouse club opening on land that we have acquire in Bogota and Bucaramanga Colombia and in Jamaica we have decide to suspend or not initiate the construction of those club for the time be
the reality be we really do not know yet how long the situation will continue
so we have curtail discretionary spending and be consider and plan for additional cost-saving measure in the U.S. and in the market where we operate
you will hear more about manage we liquidity from Michael
so now with that let I turn to the original purpose of this call we FY 2020 q2 result
total revenue be a new record for the company of $ 906.7 million a increase of 6.1 % over the comparable prior year period
net merchandise sale be $ 871.7 million a increase of 6.3 % over the prior year period
we do benefit from the extra day in this leap year
the second quarter increase result from a 5.9 % increase in transaction and a 0.3 % increase in average ticket
Currency fluctuation in we market have a $ 2.9 million or basis_point 0.3 % negative impact on net merchandise sale for the_quarter
comparable net merchandise sale increase by 0.4 % with currency fluctuation impact comparable sale negatively by 0.4 %
by segment in Central America where we have club at quarter end net merchandise sale increase 8.3 % with a 0.1 % increase in comparable net merchandise sale
the impact of currency on total and comparable sale to the Central American REIT segment be positive 1.6 % and positive 1.7 % respectively
all market within this segment show increase net merchandise sale year-on-year
in Panama we open we sixth club in May 2019 and seventh club in October 2019
and in Guatemala we open we fourth club in November 2019
we comparable store net merchandise sale be negatively impact by these new club opening
in the Caribbean region where we have club at quarter end total net merchandise sale grow 4.9 % with comparable net merchandise sale growth of 1.3 %
we Dominican Republic and Jamaica market lead the way in this segment with 17.4 % and 10.5 % growth for the_second_quarter end February 29 , 2020
in the Dominican Republic this growth be primarily attributable to the opening of we fifth club in June 2019
while in Jamaica strong comparable net merchandise sale growth be the primary driver of growth for the_second_quarter end February 29 , 2020
Jamaica it be at a new all-time monthly sale record for the company
they bakery alone do $ 1.6 million in sale in the month of December another record which be enable in part by the investment we previously make to expand the club and add parking
the impact of currency on both total and comparable merchandise sale for the Caribbean segment be negative 2 %
in Colombia where we have club net merchandise sale grow 0.2 % for the_quarter and there be a decrease in comparable net merchandise sale of 0.6 %
the impact of currency on total and comparable net merchandise sale in Colombia be significant at negative 6.1 % and negative 6.4 % respectively
with regard to merchandise in term of consolidated merchandise category we experience good growth in we fresh category drive primarily by growth in we prepared food poultry and produce department
we also see favorable growth in department such as pet supplies toy tire and sport drink health and beauty as well as electronics and the appliance category within hardline
now let 's turn to membership
at the end of q2 we continue to report very positive result
we end the_quarter with approximately 1.7 million account also a new company record and a 3 % increase over the prior year period
membership income be up by 9.7 % during the_quarter
the growth in account and income during fiscal can be primarily attribute to the opening of new warehouse club compare to last_year in we central american and caribbean market
membership income in we colombian market have also be positively impact by a 20_% increase in the Diamond membership fee beginning in April 2019
we trail 12-month renewal rate be 86 % and 85 % for the period end February 29 , 2020 and February 28 , 2019 respectively
we platinum membership which offer cash back base on purchase volume in exchange for a higher annual fee represent approximately 4.5 % of we total membership base and have be grow
total gross margin this_quarter increase to 16.6 % from 16.1 % in q2 fiscal 2019
Gross margin when compare to the prior year period be impact mostly by favorable net merchandise margin
net merchandise margin for q2 increase basis_point to 14.7 % from 14.0 % versus the same period a year ago which be in line with we precede 2 quarter and prior year 's historical trend
net income for the_second_quarter of_fiscal year_2020 grow 7.6 % to $ 25.6 million or $ 0.85 per share compare to $ 23.8 million or $ 0.79 per share in the comparable period last_year
now remember we end this_quarter with warehouse club compare to club at the end of the second quarter of_fiscal year ' 19
the new club include in Panama refer to as Veraguas and Metropark and in the Dominican Republic the Bolivar club and most recently the San Cristobal club that open in November of 2019 in Guatemala
so now briefly turn to March sale which we release earlier this week
net merchandise sale be $ 306.1 million a increase of 17.1 % versus a year ago
fx fluctuation adversely impact net merchandise sale by 2.5 %
for the 4 week end March 29 , 2020 comparable net merchandise sale increase 15.7 % with a negative fx impact of 3 %
although overall sale for the month of March 2020 increase significantly drive by member stock up primarily on food and essential ahead of the potential shelter in place advisory
sale do moderate and later decrease in the second half of the month
toward the end of March we experience a noticeable reduction in traffic that we believe be drive by restrictive government mandate and consumer concern about potential exposure
so to wrap up we post strong result for q2 and strong sale for March
we effort to recommit to the Sixth Right during the preceding year be show result on key metric
we also recognize that a lot be change and there be many unknown at this time
therefore it be difficult to predict when and how we member consumption and spending pattern will adjust to a new normal
as we sit here today we expect the impact of the pandemic and the related restriction on we business to adversely affect traffic and sale over the next several month
and we recognize that the financial impact that covid-19 will have on we market could also cause a downward trend in sale for some time
have say that we also see this as a opportunity
we have learn a lot in the last 6 week about what we team be capable of accomplish
everyone from we club and distribution center operator to the executive team everyone at all level
it be nothing short of inspiring
we team have talent resolve and a tremendous commitment to we member into this company and we have loyal member who really count on we as a trust source of goods
a lot of family depend on we especially in time like this
so we be treat this as a call to action
we have already cover a lot of ground and make a lot of progress on several front that will carry we forward long after this chapter end
and we intend to seize on the opportunity rise from this challenge to propel we business forward and position ourselves for the_future
I be hope you and you family stay safe and healthy
I will now turn this over to Michael
thank you Sherry and good morning or afternoon to everyone in my first earnings conference call as Chief_Financial_Officer
first I would like to thank Sherry the Board and all of my other PriceSmart colleague for they support during my interim CFO phase which have now lead to this permanent position
however I would also like to acknowledge the difficult time we be all face through the covid-19 crisis and extend my heartfelt best wish to everybody on this call today as I imagine you all have be either directly or indirectly impact by this crisis
as Sherry discuss earlier the_second_quarter of_fiscal total revenue be $ 906.7 million a increase of 6.1 % and gross margin rise basis_point to 16.6 % compare to 16.1 % in the_second_quarter of_fiscal
total sg&a as a percentage of total revenue be 12.3 % a increase of basis_point versus the same period last_year
the increase year-over-year be primarily drive by additional head count related to the opening of we newest club and investment in talent to support we technology development and other administrative function
operate income be $ 38.8 million or 4.3 % of total revenue in q2 of fiscal compare to $ 36.5 million or 4.3 % of total revenue for the same period last_year
the improvement be largely due to higher net merchandising margin in the_second_quarter of_fiscal versus the same period last_year partially offset by a increase in sg&a expense due to we new club as indicate earlier
we effective tax rate for the_second_quarter of_fiscal be essentially flat versus the_prior_year come in at 33.1 % versus a rate of 32.9 % a year ago
while over the last few year we have generally provide a indication of we expectation for we full year effective tax rate due to the current COVID - related uncertainty and project full year result we be unable to provide such a indication at this time
net income increase 7.6 % to $ 25.6 million with diluted earnings per share of $ 0.85 in the_second_quarter of_fiscal compare to $ 23.8 million with diluted earnings per share of $ 0.79 from the second quarter of last year
move on to the balance_sheet
we end the_quarter with cash cash equivalent and restricted cash of $ 136.8 million a increase of $ 38.7 million versus the same period a year ago
cash provide by operate activity increase $ 12.8 million versus the same period last_year primarily due to higher net income and work capital improvement
net cash use in invest activity increase by $ 31.9 million primarily due to net increase in purchase of short-term investment and construction payment during the_year
net cash provide by financing activity increase $ 44.3 million primarily due to new long-term borrowing in we colombian and guatemalan subsidiary
turn now to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and how this be affect we in term of liquidity
we be implement measure to preserve we liquidity and strengthen we balance_sheet during these unprecedented time
we be reevaluate additional need for liquidity give the potential social and economic impact in the market where we operate and any result impact on we result of operation and cash_flow
while we can not reasonably estimate the duration or severity of this pandemic at this time it be likely that we will see some negative impact especially on sale over at least the near term
therefore as a precautionary measure early in q3 we have access $ 63.2 million of funding available in several of we line of credit to increase available cash on hand
additionally as Sherry mention we have postpone the construction and opening of new club which will reduce we capital expenditure and work capital need significantly in the short term while we continue to evaluate the situation and the duration of the disruption
finally we be work with all we merchandise and other vendor to extend payment term and thus create additional liquidity
in closing we business remain very strong during q2 and we have great momentum lead into this worldwide crisis
we second quarter result be excellent and validate the strategy we have in place be the right one
these result highlight that sale margin and membership renewal continue to show strong result and strengthen the core of we business
with that say we environment have suddenly change with the outbreak of covid-19
with each pass week during this crisis we continue to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape we face find ourselves in
we will continue to focus on the six rights we employee we member and we community
we will keep you update as the condition continue to progress in the coming month
as we turn to the q&a section of this call I would like to remind you all that we have never provide earnings guidance
and with this unprecedented situation we be currently endure it will be even harder to give you all a good sense as to how severely and for how long we result will be impact by the situation
in any case if you have any question relate to how we be execute we covid-19 response initiative we will do we best to answer they
as mention at the beginning of this call we would appreciate it if you could limit you question to per person
operator I will turn it back to you to take up to question from each of we caller
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- first question come from Rodrigo Echagaray with Scotiabank
Congrats Michael on you new role
I would say on my end I would like to perhaps hear you thought on what will it take for you to revisit store opening
and I guess more specifically be this related more to the temporary disruption on covid-19
or be it more related to structural concern with regard to the region where you operate in term of the macro short to mid-term
and I guess the second question would be on the e-commerce front
what kind of growth be you see in the past few day
any color that you can share with we would be great
Rodrigo so if I understand you first question be basically we decision to suspend some of the store opening or the club opening and you want a little color about around that correct
yes I mean I guess how be you think about that
I mean I guess I be try to get a sense on be we perhaps be obviously responsible and cautious for obvious reason
but once disruption cease and everything go back to normal then be we look at those store opening be back on the pipeline quickly
or be it something that it will take a few month until you feel comfortable put those back in the pipeline
well let I put it to you this way
before the pandemic we be completely on track for those opening
so it be not anything structural or in term of the market themselves that lead we to decide not to do it
it be the pandemic
and then of course the result impact of the pandemic can and may have on these market go forward which be really the part that be the big unknown for all of we at this point
so with that kind of a variable at play the best answer I can give you be that we be just monitor it
we be try to get the best information we can and assess what the impact on we market be and then at the appropriate time we will move forward
so as of now it seem that the most prudent thing to do in the face of this kind of unexpected event be to suspend that and to preserve capital and focus on deliver we best performance for we member with the club that we have in the market where we exist
get it
you second question related to e-commerce growth
e-commerce it be hard to quantify
again this be all happen so quickly
I can tell you anecdotally that the response we be get we track social media now and we be much more connect to we member digitally
we be see the response and the reaction to have more online presence the fact that we member can go now online and see we product order they pay for they at least in we first location so far
and that be all be extremely favorable
now it be about build up quickly ramp up the operational side to be able to support the demand
so I can not quantify for you what the demand be but you can sort of assume that when people do not want to leave they home or if they do leave they home they do not want to spend a lot of time be expose to other people who might be carry the virus
there be a real demand for e-commerce and there be a real demand for all of the type of shopping that you can do that minimize physical interaction with other people
and that be what we be focus on and that be what we have be expedite and make great progress on in a very short period of time
and so I guess can you maybe share if all the store or a x percentage of the store have now the ability to for customer to shop online and maybe do click and collect how many store be we look at that be capable of do this
well okay if you look at the capability the first step be to make sure that all the inventory that be available in the club be visible online
so have the online catalog that show a description the price the whether or not the product be available that now exist in all of we country
so that be a development that be happen since this pandemic be announce
then you add on that the ability to once you have that information it open the door to the alternative way of shopping
one be the ability to e-mail or through phone conversation contact a PriceSmart employee and be able to get a order or order something to be pick up or deliver
that be what we be call assist shopping
that be happen throughout a number of we club at this time
the most advanced right_now be the click and collect which be I be sorry the click and go which be in we launch it in Costa Rica in we Santa Ana club and that be be go extremely well
and we have a very aggressive rollout plan to all of we other market in a matter of week
so we start with one make sure we get the kink out and we be do it right and set up the protocol so that we can efficiently roll this out throughout the rest of the company
that sound like you guy have really step it up in the last few week which make a lot of sense
and on the delivery if I can just maybe double-click on that for a second
I think you be
okay
you be just so you know officially you be on question number four but it be okay go ahead
I be sorry about that
I be just go to leave it at that and hopefully somebody else
it be okay Rodrigo I be just give you hard time
no I know
I know
it be just that I have a lot of question but I will let other one take turn
that be okay
why do not you ask that last one that be fine
now it be just on the delivery
I mean you be mention you be use both some aggregator and also you be do some of that in-house
can you maybe share more color on both of those strategy
yes
as you know give the fact that we operate in different market the best solution vary from market to market
in Colombia we partner with rappi as one example
and it be not a one solution for each market
it vary
we do a combination of to have we own employee deliver
we have get we have secure vehicle that allow for we to be able to do delivery we partner with third party
and we be right at on the brink of finalize contract with another major delivery service if you will that will be able to provide this service to we member throughout most of we market
so it be a combination of different channel that allow we to get the product to the member
next question come from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital
as you tackle this covid-19 issue what kind of flexibility do you have in you cost structure at the store level
and have you be make adjustment there
I be just curious what may be potentially some deleveraging of expense how you be go to try and minimize that deleveraging of expense
well with regard to that we be watch every penny as we should
and Michael be do a great job of that
and we have eliminate or reduce what we consider to be any sort of excess
but have say that we think it be very important to have a balanced approach especially during this time
the initial instinct may be to just hunker down and dial back on everything
but what we be actually find be because of the situation we team be able to move forward pretty quickly on intervention and on new initiative that frankly we do not know we could deliver on as quickly as we have
and in that effort we be realize we actually need to deploy we resource and we labor in a more thoughtful way because there be opportunity here to now reskill some of we employee and assign they task that will support these initiative that we believe be not only need by we member today but be go to strengthen we company for the long term
so while we be watch expense and we be be vigilant about that and take as responsible and as compassionate a approach as we possibly can we be also not shy about make the right investment in the right area that be go to get we through this stronger than we be come into it
okay
okay
the second question Sherry what be you see or maybe it be a little bit early on the membership or new membership count
I see that in Colombia membership be down year-over year up elsewhere
but how be you market
how be the how be you how be membership roll as we get further and further into this covid-19 be we see any material difference in the trend that we have see over the last couple of year
well I can not I do not have in front of I March but in term I do not think we report anything in a partial month
so we be in April right_now
so I can not really share anything more on that
but certainly people right_now be behave differently in term of what they be buy how much they be buy we be see surge and then we be see change in term of average ticket and so on
but it be too soon for I to be able to share any kind of trend that I could predict or see emerge as a result of the membership
okay
all right
one last question
if the product mix shift more to necessity as oppose to other item that be not so essential
how do that influence you gross margin
how be a mix shift like that
well I mean we be constantly try to manage margin appropriately
we be continually look for way to make sure that we be get the best value for the member consistent with the six rights
as we see a greater need for essential and basic necessity we be leverage local vendor as well and supplier to make sure that we be able to deliver the product that they need
so at this point it be again too soon to tell what will come out of this phase of a dramatic shift in the way that people be shop
and the demand as well as the supply and but beyond that I really do not have any more to share in term of foresight
okay
all right
a lot of imponderable out there and I wish you the best luck
it be a difficult environment
we really appreciate you well wish and we be do the best we can and we be feel good about we ability to get through this and take care of we member and learn a lot in the process
this conclude we question-and-answer session
the conference have now conclude
thank you for attend today 's presentation
you may now disconnect
greeting and welcome to the Pure Cycle Corporation 2020 second quarter and 6-Month Financial Conference
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- it be now my pleasure to introduce you to you speaker Mark Harding
Mr. Harding you may begin
thank you and I would like to welcome you all to we second quarter call
some housekeeping measure
we do have a slide deck for this
so if you want to log in to we website it should be on the front landing page
it will just say second quarter presentation
if you do not see it there then you can surf over to the investor section and there will be a link there as well
so that will allow you to follow along with the presentation and the prepared remark
I be go to beg forgiveness for those of you who be new to the company
probably just jump into sort of the quarter end without give kind of the overview typical overview of the company
we have get some excellent resource on we website if you be new to the company and want to get a little bit more color about sort of how we do thing and how we get to where we be
there be a couple of podcast on there that will give you that presentation
but with that let I go ahead and start the call here
and the first thing I need to do be while I say I be go to go through the presentation quickly I get to get through at least the second slide which be to get the lawyer out of the room say that this be we safe harbor statement and really these be we forward-leading statement not intend to be policy or direction or guidance to we investor
so with that I be go to roll scroll you guy down to slide and really start by give you all a update into we land development segment and give you kind of a update of the activity that we have have
as you all know we have get a very large master plan community locate in the i-70 corridor here in the Denver metropolitan area
we have embark on we first phase of that which include a little over lot
we have national homebuilder that be under contract for all of we home all we lot on that
we have Richmond America Taylor Morrison and kb and all of they be very active in build home out there
we have of the lot I think we have deliver about of the lot
so there be really just more takedown
I think Richmond have take down all of they lot
Taylor Morrison have one more takedown requirement one more takedown of lot which will be about lot
and then I think kb have another lot and they be go to be plus or minus maybe a little bit more than lot
I think they have get maybe 2 more takedown schedule
the really nice thing about we project here be all of we builder have accelerate they takedown from they original contract schedule mostly due to really the success that this project have have
we have have a great entry into the market mostly because of we price point
we price point be a entry-level price point
we home start in sort of the kind of -lsb- 3 40 3 50 -rsb- range
that be as sad as that may sound that be the starter home in the Denver market
but we have a real mix of homeowner out there
we have have we first sort of share we homeowner community meeting and get a chance to meet with a number of those folk
we have about a little more than people occupy house out there
and the first community meeting be a huge success
I think we have more than home represent family from home represent
I will throw a shout out there to kb who give we one of they model home for the meeting place there and they give we some thing to snack on there
so I give they a shout out and thank they for that
but the project be go great
in addition to the actual occupied home we probably get I would say home under construction
so I would say we be right close to home either build or under construction
we have get I be go to let I pull that back about building permit issue
so you can not get start on a home until you have actually get a building permit
we have pay tap fee
so in addition to sell lot as many of you know we be a water utility and we keep that track of that metric as well
we have get about water and wastewater tap purchase from we homebuilder
and then how this be likely to roll out for the rest of this first phase we will deliver the remain lot through calendar year-end
so there be of those or more closing those be stagger throughout the rest of the_year
so you will see announcement as we get those close
I will likely send out a press_release for each of those announcement to let everybody know how those be progress through
I will move to the next slide slide that will kind of give you both a visual as well as a numerical representation of the progress since q1
so you can see we be have a tremendous start and then we be really just get into the building season
so we have get a number of new home
I would say resident as we be describe and I think home builder be average about home per month per builder
so that absorption have be very exciting over the winter
we will see how that continue to progress in this new environment that we be in
and we will talk a little bit more about that later in the presentation
move to slide
slide will really kind of give you a view of the rest of the project
that be about acre in total
so this first acre be really just the first entry into that
and as you can see I want to highlight really the next residential component of that
the next phase incorporate acre and there be much more than just the residential component
we have a large commercial component which be go to be up along the interstate
so we have about a half a mile of frontage along the interstate and we have we own interchange that be exist right at the exit to the property
but we be go to focus in on kind of the next residential component of that and we have a very broad product mix in we next residential component
if you flip to the next page that will kind of give you kind of a land plan layout
and really the mix be go to be more than we have kind of in we first phase we just have product mix a 45-foot and a 50-foot lot
those be pretty homogeneous that do allow the builder to be able to take a wide variety of home on those site but it be still a pretty typical stand-alone detach single-family house
in the next phase we will have a little bit more density on the per acre on that
we will have some smaller lot a 32-foot single family and like the first phase
we will have some paired product out there which mean we will have some duplex and then some townhome product where we will have cluster
and so it relatively do speak to a much larger customer base a much more diversified product offering amongst the number of builder that we be look at
we will likely phase this in so this will be we second phase but we will probably have micro phase here
as you can kind of see we have set that up where you can see each phase be somewhere in the 230 to 260 lot delivery
and so it allow we to be able to manage we construction cost so we do not get too far out develop those lot before we move on to the next increment
I think we do a very good job of efficiently deliver the first lot in we first phase
and so we do not want to stray too far away from that model because I think that be very good not only for we builder so that they do not have to inventory too much as well as the company so we do not have to inventory too much in term of the development cost
so we can do a lot of those land like the earthwork
maybe we carve that up into phase but we can carve up the utility and the road curve and gutter into phase so that we be much more real time in deliver those
so that be I know important to we shareholder because they want to make sure that we be use we capital wisely
we be not put too much into we work in progress or WIP on that without have we builder kind of there with we payment progress
I think we contract be go to look very similar in the second phase as they look in the first phase where we be go to get maybe delivery schedule where we will get pay a portion of the lot cost of finish lot cost as we plot the property and then a progress payment as we deliver wet utility and then a final progress payment as we deliver the final lot final finished lot
pricing be probably go to be a little bit stronger
I would like to be able to disclose that pricing to you
I think we know I have a pretty good idea about that
but until we get we contract finalize with each of we builder I be go to keep that in we pocket and we will look forward to give you that guidance as that become available to we
let 's move on to Page
so Page as you know we also supply water and wastewater service
and one of the biggest activity that we have in the water segment be supply water to the oil and gas industry when the oil and gas industry exist
they seem to have take a hiatus this_year just mostly due to the price of oil
we do have some repositioning of the asset in the field
so we largest operator ConocoPhillips have sell they position in this field to a group call a private company call Crestone Peak Resources
you can Google they and find out a little bit more about they
but they be almost exclusively own by canadian pension fund
so they operate a little bit differently than maybe a public e&p company
they really do have a long-term focus
I have be very impressed with they management and they leadership
in point of the transition how they have handle the transition the communication channel that we have with they about how they look to take a look at the field and then also what be go_on in the current market with oil in the mid-20s now which be a significant improvement than it be maybe or 7 day ago but look at oil in the low 20s it certainly put a lot of pressure on e&p company ability to really invest into a field right_now
and so I think most of they activity be on hold for in term of new exploration
one of the thing that they do have as a carryover from ConocoPhillips be they have well that Conoco have drill and complete on the drilling side but they have not frack those well
so if you look at some of the low-hanging fruit and they look at this as to say base on we will make a sort of a month-to-month assessment base on the price of oil as to how we want to pick up and the timing of complete those well so that they can get those in production and really a very modest investment to bring on production or at least complete those well and hold those lease by production
so there be a little bit of opportunity for we to have some activity on that but I do not have a lot of guidance on that because they do not have a lot of guidance just yet
move to the next slide slide
let I give you some of the financial metric we water asset
so we asset be go up continue to go up from year-end last_year as well as do we cash and investment
so you always want to own company that have increase asset as well as increase cash position
that usually mean that they be make money
and this be one of those area where we find ourselves in a very unique position where we be very strong and very highly appreciate asset base and a very strong and not make very much money but a lot of liquidity within the company
I be sorry let I take that that could be misinterpret
we be make a lot of money
we cash be not make a lot of money right_now
let I roll to the next slide slide
that give you kind of the metric on the P&L
operate revenue that be a 6-month number $ 14 million over what be last_year
so we be a little bit ahead of where we be this month this time last_year
and then growth in income from continue operation on the share basis $ 0.25 a share
and then profitability if you take a look at the net income after-tax we be we have use up all we tax credit
so now I end up have to send some of those dollar to help support that $ 2 trillion benefit package that Washington have send out
but we be now happy to be report a very good margin after-tax profit
Page will give you kind of a breakdown on where that money be come from
so if you look at the land development segment a little over $ 10.8 million on lot sale
the tap fee revenue be about $ 2.8 million
so we be get a good monetization of the equity value that we have in we water system
what have fall off be obviously fracking water revenue
so very nominal revenue for this fiscal year in the fracking revenue
we really have not have a single frac in this fiscal year
that revenue that you see there that $ 57,000 be sort of incidental water that would be go to a pad site for any construction activity in the pad side water compaction or a number of thing like that
and then we also have some oil and gas mineral
and what you see be kind of a substantial tick up in we oil and gas royalty and that be because Conoco have drill and complete another 4-well pad site on some of we land
and if you remember we have section where we carry forward net mineral interest on that
this be in the smaller portion of that
we have 1/8th pool in where these well be
and then in the other pool interest we have of that
so this be even in the smaller well pool
so it give you kind of a impact on the fact that this be a very oil-rich field and but for the price of oil be in the 20s would be be develop on a pretty aggressive basis
and so there will be cycle in that
this too will end in term of the pricing war that we have currently in the oil sector and we will continue to be able to monetize that in term of we mineral estate as well as the opportunity to share we water asset and sell water for frack revenue
next slide balance sheet impact
so that give you a kind of a period-over-period balance sheet impact
and then on the Slide sort of the P&L
one of the non-gaap measure there that I think be good to keep track of be we sort of we EBITDA we non-gaap ebitda there
so you get $ 8.7 million for the 6 month end
so when you look at sort of trend on how 's the company do with its asset you investment into these asset over those many year have really start to really benefit we shareholder and really provide value to that
so with that I do want to spend a little bit of time talk about sort of we unique the world that we be in sort of today and talk about some of we response to the virus impact
water and wastewater be essential service
so we be one of those exempt industry and we employee be exempt
so we day-to-day operation be pretty much pretty normal
I would say we field crew be pretty I would say standard
we have the typical folk that be go to be in and out of a flu season
we be very particular about if somebody be sick
we want they to stay home
we give they the company as a employee - centric company we have a very generous pto policy
so we want to make sure that one they take care of they health but then they also make sure that we take care of all of we coworker health as well
but that say we do have to be on site
we do have to make sure that the water keep flow and wastewater keep be process
we office personnel probably mix where we have 80 % of the people still commute to the office
we try to stick to we office and maintain we distance from each other just to have best practice and make sure that we have continue healthy professional here
but we do have some folk that have a type of job responsibility where they can commute from home and they do a very efficient job and be very productive of be able to do that
some of we engineer and account staff can do some of that stuff remotely
we builder continue to complete the house that they have under contract
they have say that they walkthrough the on-site traffic be down substantially and that be really primarily because Colorado like I think most state in the U.S. be on sort of a stay-at-home period where other than essential activity they be sort of discourage that essential activity
that say the construction industry itself be classify as essential
so while they may not have a lot of construction they do have a lot of contract and a lot of home that be in the pipeline and there be there continue to be a lot of activity on site
so those home that have start construction or that they have contract for they continue to start new start
they continue to complete those home because they have specific delivery time line on that and we have to support that
so we field crew be out there set meter make sure that we have inspection on water and sewer line and all that activity
what else
I think I do mention the oil and gas activity
that have be defer for
but again there be well that be sort of that low-hanging fruit and we will see how the we new partner look to capitalize on be able to invest in those new activity and I be sorry those exist well to frac those and bring those thing on to market
if you take a look at we phase
we be in conversation with as many as different builder
we do not think we have room for all builder but we have we have sort of put it in front of national homebuilder and all want to be in the project and we be try to balance out each individual builder with what they product specialty be
so some builder specialize on paired product
some builder have townhome product
some builder have alley load product and some builder do not
and so we want to figure out and really find a market segmentation for each of the builder to be able to get they to have some value proposition of do what they do well segment out the different type of player that we have on the site and really look to finalize those agreement within the next 90 day
we opportunity would be to be able to be under construction and be in the ground sometime late this year
I would say I keep say September October but because of where we be at with we current market condition I be look for maybe November December time frame
so we will see how this continue on
but still be in a position where we can deliver lot for that sometime in time frame and then they can start construct on some of they model home and then be really opportunistic by sell some of what they product be
so some of the builder that we have in we first phase have a strong interest in be in we second phase as well as some new builder
so look at how that traffic be go to go through the winter of '21 as well so they can continue to build through the season on that
so with that what I would like to do be turn it back over to the moderator maybe open it up to some question
I know you all probably have a lot of question about how we be handle all of the activity and sort of what this current market condition might impact on the company
so with that I will turn it back over
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from -lsb- Elliot Knight -rsb- of -lsb- Knight Advisors -rsb-
you have not say anything on the call about the commercial
you have get acre that you highlight there
could you tell we what you plan be there and what the time table what timetable do you anticipate
great question
so while I be very excite about the residential component of that and that be kind of where a lot of my attention have be occupy just solidify those contract with the builder
you be right we have a very large commercial component to this property
and commercial usually lag on we commercial piece but not really to the point where we have find the right opportunity yet
a lot of the interest I would say 70 % of the call and the serious call on it have be people that want to put it under contract and then they want to market to somebody who be actually go to develop
and we have the flexibility to be able to go from we position to a direct user rather than have a intermediary in there not that we be go to be build it or not that we think that we have for significant value independent of somebody that would say I want to buy acre and then I want to bring a deal to Walmart or to Kroger
certainly those be the opportunity to do that
and if they have that type of structure that be where we be interested
we look at commercial where it have opportunity for both retail and commercial
so you will have a lot of employment base
it will have a lot of product offering where you can get you will have the typical walmart target big-box store Home Depots the fast casual on the restaurant side sort of a mixed use of really all different type of retail and commercial use out there
and so we be look at kind of the right model
and each time we kind of configure we land plan we be look at some of the demographic that we have on that and what those demographic can bring to the type of retail or commercial player that be there
but I would say that still if I scale this on say on a to where I have get people build would be I have get people build commercial installation out there and be somebody make a call to we on it
I would say we be at a range on that
so I think we be still pretty early on that
I would expect that to pick up probably in the next 18 month as we get closer to the home that be under that be occupy and we get a lot more traffic out at Sky Ranch where they can kind of monitor rooftop and fence count out there for get a lifetime or get a fitness center out there or get a would so that we be participate more in the end value of that not necessarily build the value on it but participate more on the end value by just be patient with it
so we be there now
how far do they have to drive to a supermarket to a home Depot to a theater
so it will be it be almost triangulate and it be almost about mile in different direction
there will be mile to the west or I will call it mile to the west mile to the south and mile to the east to find those type of installation
so we be very well located on that
and really there be not much opportunity on land other than ours because they do not have the interchange that would give you that accessibility and that kind of the transportation network to the site itself
which make we commercial all the more attractive
it do
and it have several thing
I mean one you do benefit a lot in the value of commercial real estate
and we also benefit from the value of a commercial water user out of that
so we see value not only in the land
we see value in tap
we see value in sell water
but then there be a tremendous value here in Colorado for reimbursable
and I know I have talk about that in the_past
but when you take a look at how Colorado be incentivize we commercial real estate generate 4x the equivalent av that a residential av have
and so it do allow we to really capitalize on we full reimbursable
and we do do a bond offering
I talk about that in we last call which really encompass about 35 % of the reimbursable that we accrue for the first phase but that be value all of that residential
so when you look at it we will have we should have surplus revenue when you add in the commercial component
so that will become a very important component for we to help realize and help monetize some of those accrue reimbursable
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from Bill Miller with J.M. Hartwell
thing sound they be go really well
if you look out 3 year let 's say I want to know how what percentage of you revenue at that time will be recur
and not the tap sale or land sale or whatever
but what percentage will be recur at that point
so what I would say be that really drill down into kind of the water connection the monthly month over-month year-over-year connection that we have into the system
today we stand somewhere around pretty close to water connection and then I think maybe sewer connection
and the reason we have get a disconnect between the water and the sewer connection be we have a lot of irrigation connection
so we have more water that do not create sewer than water that be in a house create sewer
those will catch up as we get more of the single family resident but we will still have more water connection than we will have sewer connection
but within 3 year I think we be build out on at least the first phase of the
so add that would probably add another connection
so we will more than I would say just in the first phase of Sky Ranch we will more than double the size and the connection that we have there
we continue to do well on we acquisition down at Wild Pointe
so that continue to build out
so year over-year I think we be up almost 70 % from when we buy that in term of the number of connection that be add
we be get close to build out on the residential component of that
there be still a little bit of -lsb- tattle -rsb- leave in that on the commercial side
so that will continue to build out
we will add more connection
so that give you kind of a indication we could be in the 1,000 to 1,200 range on that and then continue to grow
and what we will likely see Bill and I know we have talk about this but we will likely see we will have multiple phase go_on at Sky Ranch
and then as other property that we do not necessarily own but that we extend we utility to continue to add and grow to the system that really build into sort of the capacity of we water portfolio
and so we want to have multiple project go_on at the same time that add capacity to we system in that
and so that be where you be go to see if you look at we capacity of we portfolio serve connection and we be serve today we will have a bell curve on that well where that will continue to grow slower on the front end then you get up to some very high number for a number of year and then it will trail off as we get to some of the build-out scenario on we portfolio
but to get out connection that still probably 30 year out but I think we still look very good in the short run
be there any other easy pickings on the acquisition front
I be hope somebody would ask I what be I go to do with all we cash
yes
well that be the point be not it
yes it be
it be honestly
and I know we have talk about this in the_past in term of we philosophical view of how we manage we cash
and if I be at $ 3.5 million a year in my overhead and I have get $ 25 million $ 30 million of cash that be a little bit long on the cash side to be sit on the balance_sheet
it be a high quality problem and I be not go to make any money invest at t-bill
right_now I have get to give money up than invest that in t-bill on the short stuff
so we be look to be opportunistic here
we be look for acquisition that may have otherwise not be available to we or add pricing that might be a little bit more advantageous much like when we acquire Sky Ranch
I be look for land interest that do not have water to they where we can pick that land interest up
I be look for water system that be go to be stress in this market condition and may need somebody to come in and help make some improvement to they that have the liquidity to make some improvement in they
so the acquisition cost be go to be a little bit more favorable for we
and opportunity where we can extend infrastructure to area that give we more connection and more customer
so I know that be be my mantra that we have get we net out there but this be a opportunity where when you get this kind of stress into the system that those usually present good opportunity
and so we will take a look at those
we still want to be discipline about we metric and take a look at whether I get excite about it or not I think my Board be very very disciplined and very acclimate to throttle back some of my enthusiasm at time but they be also look for opportunity and to maybe risk on with some of that stuff and be opportunistic with this current condition
we will see
if there be ever a time to be aggressive about the whole thing be not we approach that at the moment
I tend to indicate I tend to agree with you on that
I think the proof of be the put to see what happen and how this current market condition impact business property owner entrepreneur the whole yard be go to it be go to have a very significant trickle down effect
and you just get to know that the liquidity will get a premium today
and so we have a very healthy balance_sheet we have a very solid liquid balance_sheet that we can pounce on deal and solve other people 's problem
and some it be not necessarily a win lose relationship because current market condition be what they be
I would say that when we acquire Sky Ranch we be in a very similar situation
and have the access that we have then and have sort of a longer time horizon to be able to make sure that we can get those asset and not impact the shareholder value and really use those asset to create more shareholder value by add water to it and increase the value that way and then add infrastructure on the utility side where we acquire some utility in the_past as well all of those be great opportunity for we
well you record be superb not only with Sky Ranch but with the acreage you buy down on the Arkansas River
so I hope the Board be not be throttle on you or constraint on you activity now
now be the time when you should have somebody devote to look at these thing
if not you you have somebody else who be whose assignment be to go out and scout for these opportunity
well Bill you just give I another wild softball there
so that give I a opportunity to introduce Kevin McNeill who be we welcome back to the company
he be we controller about a decade ago but he be go to be we new CFO and that be exactly he charge be to get out there and start comb the landscape and see what opportunity be go to be available to we and put some metric to it and see if we can generate some action there
so that it be exactly a great time for Kevin to come back to we on that a lot of activity and there be go to be plenty of deal that we can comb through
so while I think I still have a little bit of game and I appreciate you kind word there I might give you my wife 's phone number so that you can give I a slug
but yes I mean we really we be take it very seriously and we be staffing up to be able to be aggressive on that
Great
I be glad to hear that because you will get pay ultimately for recur revenue
you be very astute on that and never fail to point that out for I
well point out the obvious be a skill I have
well thanks for kick in and stay healthy
you too
great job
we next question come from -lsb- Bill Cunningham -rsb-
I have actually a question on what be go_on with the actual contract be sign
my most recent article on seek alpha talk about what Richmond American be report
it be great that they report in real time what be happen with contract signing
and I have be monitor carefully recently because I expect to see potentially cancellation because that be what I have see all along with they website be you will see something report as sell because the contract have be sign and then it go out because of assume maybe the purchaser do not qualify or something else go_on
so there be a lot of change there
so I be I have be look at the site the last couple of week and expect to see cancellation with everything go_on in the market
and instead there be be cancellation and there be actually be a number of new contract sign in the past week
so I be kind of curious as to what you general spin be not just with pure cycle and sky Ranch but what you be see with the market overall and housing and how some of this may want to look at the real estate market in general the next few month or couple of year
great question one that it be probably I can only give you anecdotal comment on
but if I reference anything and this will be kind of a first-hand experience
Kevin come back he move back he relocate back from Austin Texas
and we typically do not like to welcome Texans in here but at least they have the right voting pattern
but anyway he come back and he really want to buy a house in Sky Ranch
and so if he be move back he go out and meet with all builder and say hey listen I want to buy a house
and they say Great
we be 9 month out
he say but I need a house in March
then they say well good luck
you can not get one
and not only do he find that experience here but in kind of the surrounding area
and so one of the thing that we know be that there be strong demand at Sky Ranch
there be strong demand in the i-70 corridor
and so you look at where we be at we be in the right location and I think we be in the right price point in that
and so I firmly believe that we will continue to see that same pace of contract
I know that they traffic be go to be down just because everybody be stay at home
but I know a bunch of people be sit around the kitchen table talk about you know what this house be too small
the kid be home and everybody be sit around
they be climb the wall go I want something else
and so I think you be go to find some pent-up demand and some people be go to I think we governor extend it to another couple of week
but even outside that they still have showing
they be still out there on site
they still have showing
they still have people that have a need and I really believe you be go to see a rush of people come out put the stuff under contract
and then everybody be go to be beat I up say why do not you get that second project online sooner
so I think it be go to be a high-quality problem for we
we want to be very react to it
we want to be able to invest some of that liquidity position we have into some acquisition opportunity as well as be able to invest into some of we next phase lot
I try and time those contract so we play on the house 's money and then we take we equity in the back end
but I think that structure will still serve we well and give we some strong rope to go out there and lasso some of these deal
it be truly surprising to see no cancellation and new contract be sign in the last few week
totally separate question
I also notice you have still get some revenue come in from you oil and gas activity
and although the whole fracking industry it be a unprofitable industry at this point every dollar of revenue basically you get in be just income
you be not deal with cost against it
so although revenue be down you be generate a certain amount of income from it
it be not it be never go to generate a loss for you and I think that be a rather important concept -lsb- indiscernible -rsb-
that be right
it be a very important distinction
and there be it be all a variable cost to we right
so I do not have a lot of fix cost that be outside that
so I can dial that up
I can dial that down
and you be right if I be not get any revenue in I be not incur the cost attributable to that
so that be a very attractive segment for we
Mr. Harding it look like we have no further question at this time
would you like to make any closing remark
I would
thanks
so again I want to thank all of you for you continued loyalty and you continued support
we be very proud of be in this position and really it be a it be really a discipline of you guy have patience the company have patience the Board sticking to its metric management sticking to they metric and be able to rightsize the company and grow the company and acquire valuable asset
we will continue to do that
we be very thankful of have we liquidity and we highly appreciate asset in time like these and we will continue to try and make good decision on you behalf
and what we will be to foreshadow anything come up assume that we return to a bit more normal I would like to have another investor day for you all to come out again over the summer when you can see a ton of thing go_on much more activity on the site
so as we get a little bit closer into that maybe over in the July time frame I will send out a little save the date and we can welcome you all that have be follow the company if you have not have a chance to come out and those of you who be new to the company have a chance to kick the tire because there be nothing quite like see it and get you arm around it for a real tangible view of what we do
so thank you
and with that I will sign off
and I look forward if anybody who have a question that could not get through that have a technical challenge do not hesitate to give I a holler
thanks
thank you

I will start the call by discuss how we be manage we business through the covid-19_pandemic
then I will provide a update on we map to growth operating improvement program
after that I will turn the call over to Matt who will walk through we third quarter result in detail and he will be follow by Rusty who will discuss the outlook for the_fourth_quarter and year-end
first we know that all of you be deal with disruption in you professional and personal life result from the covid-19_pandemic especially we analyst and investor from the New York City area
I would like to thank you for be on we call today and for you continue interest in RPM and wish you and you family good health during this challenging time
at RPM we priority have be to protect the health and well-being of we associate and they family member to support we local community to control the spread of the virus and to serve we customer by maintain the continuity and success of we business operation
we associate around the world have really embrace these priority and I would like to commend they for the incredible work that they have do to continue each and every day
when it come to protect they own health and that of they family we have establish many protocol across we operation
we be take precaution in we facility to keep we people safe by aggressively clean and disinfect high-touch area practice social distancing and good hygiene and have be screen for covid-19 symptom prior to entry in all of we facility for more than 3 week
as of April 7 we have be inform by of we employee that they have have at various time confirm case of coronavirus
in these case we enact we protocol to shut_down the affect location have they thoroughly clean and disinfect quarantine all appropriate -- affected people and then reopen the facility follow a appropriate shutdown period
in term of we community we be work from home monitor the hygiene and health of we manufacturing and distribution associate and report any infection or disruption
we be also donate time and material to help stem the spread of the virus
in one case we Woodfinishes Group supply thousand of plastic bottle to a local distillery that have be convert product to hand sanitizer and be provide it to free in the community especially to health care first responder
in another case we Rust-Oleum operation source its Concrobium fogger product and donate it to first responder so that they air ambulance helicopter could be disinfect and return to service quickly
these be just a few example of how we operation be respond to local need
as one of the world 's largest supplier of specialty coating and building material RPM be in a strong position to weather the toll that the covid-19_pandemic be have on the global economy
we be take action to adjust we business activity during this period of uncertainty and be well position with strong cash_flow a solid capital structure and $ 1.1 billion in liquidity
many of we product be use for construction maintenance and repair project which be deem essential in many case and be relatively recession-resistant
rpm company around the world with a few exception have be able to continue to operate they plant and distribution center
in fact today nearly all of we north american plant be operational with a few exception while a number of we international plant have be close due to government mandate
a large number of we north american customer such those in such as those in construction infrastructure and diy home and hardware retail be also consider essential and currently remain open for business
with people spend more time in they home there be potential for increase diy activity project
raw material cost inflation seem to be moderate in a number of we key product category we global supply_chain remain strong and we distribution and operation associate continue to work diligently to meet customer demand
we continue to be proactive in take action around the globe in we operation as the situation evolve
now I would like to discuss we map to growth restructuring program
it have steadily be gain momentum each quarter
this_quarter be no different as demonstrate by we excellent bottom line result strong organic growth strong earnings leverage and record level of cash generation
restructuring activity include enact operational improvement at we production facility consolidate manufacturing plant delayer management and rationalize product line
during the_third_quarter and early in the fourth quarter we announce the closure of additional plant which bring we total to out of the plant that be originally target for closure at the beginning of the map to growth program
Versus last_year on a consolidated basis we realize incremental map to growth savings in the_third_quarter total $ 21 million of which $ 5 million come from manufacturing $ 12 million from procurement and $ 4 million from SG&A
look ahead as the covid-19 pandemic slow economic and business activity it be also impact we map to growth program
while there be some initiative that can be carry out virtually many particularly those deal with additional manufacturing improvement and the completion of we erp to facility have require we to temporarily halt some of we operate improvement activity
as such we will be extend out the time line from we original map to growth goal in term of they ultimate achievement
at this point there be too much uncertainty to set a new date for reach we objective
as we market stabilize and we gain more clarity into the business condition we will communicate we new map to growth time line
but as you can see once again in we third quarter result we people be execute on we map to growth initiative very effectively
I will now turn the call over to Matt Ratajczak for a detailed review of we result for the_third_quarter
thanks Frank and good morning everyone
note that my comment will be on a as-adjusted basis
during the_third_quarter we generate consolidated net sale of $ 1.17 billion a increase of 2.9 % compare to the $ 1.14 billion report during the same quarter of fiscal
Organic sale growth be 3 % or $ 34 million
acquisition contribute 0.7 % of sale or $ 9 million while foreign exchange be a headwind that reduce sale by 0.8 % or $ 9.6 million
this be solid top line growth during the_third_quarter which typically generate we most modest result each year because it fall during the winter month when painting and construction activity be slow
adjust diluted earnings per share be $ 0.23 a increase of 76.9 % compare to the $ 0.13 in the year ago quarter
we consolidated adjusted earnings before interest and tax ebit be up 30.4 % to $ 60.5 million compare to $ 46.4 million report in the fiscal 2019 third quarter
these excellent bottom line result be largely due to initiative under we map to growth restructuring program
we earnings also benefit from pricing and moderate raw material cost
turn now to we segment
sale in we construction Products Group be strong and increase 4.7 % to $ 372.1 million
growth be primarily organic at 5.1 % or $ 18.5 million
acquisition contribute 1 % or $ 3.4 million
foreign currency translation reduce sale by 1.4 % or $ 5.1 million
sale growth be drive by market share gain and the introduction of innovative new product with the fastest growth be generate in we roofing below-grade waterproofing and concrete admixture business
adjust ebit in the Construction Products segment increase $ 6 million from a adjusted ebit loss of $ 0.3 million during last year 's third quarter
this improvement be largely attribute to pricing moderate raw material cost map to growth savings and a favorable leverage impact of higher sale volume
sale in we Performance Coatings Group be $ 255.7 million up 1 % from the $ 253.2 million we report during last year 's third quarter
Organic growth be 1.6 % or $ 3.9 million
sale growth in this segment be mix as highway and bridge maintenance business be slow by government budget constraint particularly in the U.K. however its protective in marine coating business unit increase market share and its continental european operation grow sharply drive by a new global management structure
acquisition add 0.2 % to sale or $ 0.5 million while foreign exchange be a headwind of 0.8 % or $ 1.9 million
segment adjusted ebit increase 33.2 % to $ 24.2 million from $ 18.2 million during last year 's third quarter
a focus on higher-margin product and service offering as well as map to growth business rationalization initiative drive a significant adjusted ebit margin improvement of basis_point in the segment
in the Consumer Group sale be robust increase 5.4 % to $ 398.7 million
Organic sale increase 6 % or $ 22.6 million drive by market share gain and unseasonably warm winter weather in North_America that enable consumer to complete more DIY home improvement project
the fastest growth be achieve in we caulk sealant and patch and repair product line
there be no impact from acquisition during the_quarter
foreign currency translation reduce sale by 0.6 % or $ 2.2 million
adjust ebit in the Consumer Group be $ 32.1 million a increase of 19.2 % over the_prior_year
this bottom line performance be drive by savings from we map to growth operating improvement plan and be partially offset by inflation in certain raw material and channel mix
on the top line the Specialty Products Group 's wood coating business successfully outperform its peer in a challenging market
however sale of the segment 's water damage restoration product face a difficult comparison to the_prior_year when demand be exceptionally high due to significant weather event in North_America
sale be also down in we OEM fluorescent pigment nail polish and edible coating business
segment sale be $ 147.5 million
Organic sale decrease 7.1 % and foreign currency translation reduce sale by 0.3 %
the segment benefit 3.3 % or $ 5.1 million from acquisition
adjust ebit be $ 17.5 million during the_quarter which be lower than the $ 20.2 million of adjust EBIT report in the same period last_year
savings from we operate improvement program help to mitigate the impact decline sale volume have on earnings
in addition we have new management in place and be implement cost cut measure and new process to reignite growth
now I will provide some comment on we cash_flow and liquidity
for the first 9 month of_fiscal cash from operation grow by 162 % to $ 381.2 million compare to $ 145.5 million a year ago
this increase of $ 235.7 million be due to improve work capital management and operate improvement initiative
Free cash flow improve to a source of cash of $ 137 million during the first 9 month of fiscal as compare to a use of cash of $ 74.5 million during the first 9 month of_fiscal
this $ 211.5 million increase be a result of higher earnings couple with overall improve work capital metric
next a few comment on we liquidity profile
the maturity of we long-term debt portfolio be nicely stagger with the next schedule maturity out in November 2022 and we have multiple option for access to short-term liquidity under both we revolving credit and account receivables facility
further in the month of February we improve we financial flexibility and increase we liquidity by $ 400 million by secure 3-year term loan
we borrow $ 400 million immediately after close and swap to a euro fix interest rate of approximately 0.6 %
the proceeds be use to pay down the balance on we revolve credit facility
finally as Frank state at February 29 , 2020 we total liquidity include cash and committed revolving credit facility be $ 1.1 billion
I will now turn the call over to Rusty for detail on we share repurchase program and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal
thanks Matt
as part of we map to growth program we establish the goal of repurchase $ 1 billion of we stock
in March subsequent to the end of the third quarter we exceed the halfway point of that goal when we repurchase approximately $ 25 million of we common share
this be in addition to the $ 300 million we repurchase during fiscal and the first 3 quarter of fiscal couple with a $ 200 million cash redemption of we convertible note in November 2018
while we be make good progress on this goal give recent macroeconomic uncertainty result from the covid-19_pandemic we have suspend we share buyback program
look ahead the_fourth_quarter be seasonally we strongest and be off to a good start in March
Consolidated sale for the month increase 5 % over the_prior_year lead by the Specialty segment which be up 9 % consumer be up 7 % Construction Products Group sale increase 7 % and Performance Coatings Group decline 3 %
however like most company we expect we financial result to be impact by the disruption and uncertainty covid-19 be have on the global economy
today nearly all of we plant be open in North_America where we generate 74 % of we sale
some of we international plant have be shut_down due to government mandate around the world
these facility generate approximately 6 % of RPM sale
while these shutdown be of various duration range from day to week they be likely to impact we fourth quarter sale in April and May
in we construction Products Group demand for we innovative product and solution have be robust and the segment have very strong momentum behind it
construction be on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 's essential critical infrastructure workforce advisory list
the segment have a large number of hospital and health care system client that will continue to require its offering
during a good sale month in March Tremco be able to support school during this unexpected shutdown by move up plan roofing and other facility restoration work
at we Performance Coatings Group result will be mix
we anticipate see a boost in sale for we hygienic seamless flooring system
however the portion of we corrosion control and fireproofing coating that be tie directly or indirectly to oil and gas market a little more than $ 200 million in sale annually may be at risk should there be a prolonged drop in pricing in those market
so we be closely monitor investment in this area
pos takeaway at we Consumer Group have be strong with unit growth in the mid to high single digit particularly for we professional and consumer cleaning and disinfectant brand some of which be effective against the coronavirus
the majority of the segment sale be in North_America where DIY home and hardware retailer remain open for business
as consumer shelter in place they be spend more time in they home and have more time and interest in home repair maintenance improve and clean project which should continue to benefit the segment
in we Specialty Products Group the outlook be mixed
some of we company such as we marine coating business will be slow by the closure of they distributor and retail network
on the other hand Legend Brands which manufacture cleaning product and equipment be see spike demand as its restoration contractor base be shift to disinfect service and this trend should continue over the come month
accord to current government projection it appear that the covid-19 crisis may reach its peak in April or May
this be obviously a fluid situation and the information available to we be rapidly change
as we sit here today we anticipate that we consolidated fourth quarter revenue will be down 10 % to 15 % year-over-year
this assume we strong March result be counterbalance by sale drop in April and May of 15 % to 20_%
with that be say give the uncertainty around this crisis we be withdraw we prior earnings guidance for the_fourth_quarter and full year of fiscal
we will continue to assess the situation and the short and long-term impact of covid-19
we be take aggressive action to manage cash_flow by reduce work capital capital expenditure and discretionary spending
the map to growth program timing have be fortunate for we in this regard since we have improve margin and be start to see the benefit of we work capital reduction program result in improved cash_flow this_year
additionally as Frank and Matt mention we have significant liquidity and a strong balance_sheet which we anticipate will keep we in a solid financial position
this conclude we formal comment
we will now be please to take you question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and we have we first question from John McNulty with BMO Capital
so I guess the first one would just be on the revenue outlook
so the commentary around April and May look down 15 % to 20_%
look it be a tough market to try to forecast now
but like look at some of Rusty 's commentary on each of the division it do not sound like it be kind of trend quite as bad as maybe that guidance would necessarily indicate
so I guess where be the put and take there
and I guess when you think about the segment where you see kind of the biggest pressure when you be look at that 15 % to 20 % down versus maybe where there may be some bright spot
how should we be think about that
sure
so first of all it do not behoove anybody to do forecasting with a optimistic outlook
and so I think we assumption of April and May be down 15 % to 20_% have be do appropriately with a negative conservative cast
but it be literally hard to tell from day-to-day
we will have spike in some of we construction Products business over a couple day period because of order flow that look really good and then you will see some slowdown
the thing that be pretty certain will be the negative impact of multi-week shutdown
most of this be outside of the United_States probably a little less than half of we manufacturing facility in Europe be close
and I will not get into all the detail but it be a interesting mix
we have a plant in Norway close that be now reopen
interestingly we primary plant in Italy be now reopen
but we have plant in the U.K. and various part of the continent that be close by government mandate for a period of week
we be also close in we major plant in India and almost every manufacturing facility in Latin and South America and in South Africa
there be a few other location but they be so small as to be inconsequential
as Rusty say when you add that all up on a annualize basis it be about 6 % of we revenue
so it be not big
and the impact of reopen will determine whether we be at the bottom end of that range and the top end of that range
I think the good news for we be we be not yet see the underlie demand disruption that exist in some industry
obviously the hospitality industry have challenge
but even the auto assembly industry have get some challenge now that around the demand side that will be which be oil and gas and across we Performance Coatings Group that be a little more than $ 200 million of annualize revenue
and so we expectation be in the coming quarter and year that be a area that will be under pressure
hopefully that be responsive to you question
yes
no that be definitely helpful
and then I guess maybe shift gear a little bit to the map to growth cost-cutting program
I guess can you give we some clarity
look you have Wave that be you be go to get the full year benefit this_year kind of come in
wave you be go to get a decent chunk and then there be go to be Wave for next year as it would roll
and I guess can you give we a update as to where you be in those bucket
and what thing be kind of already in the bag
and what percent may be actually kind of push off at this point
be there a way to think about that
sure
and so I can tell you from my perspective and I do not mean this to be try
obviously this coronavirus pandemic be horribly impactful to everybody
but as it relate to map to growth there be a plus and a minus
the minus be as you can see in this_quarter and subsequent quarter before this the thing that we have plan the thing that we be execute be work
we have talk about work capital improvement and then quickly realize that they would come later in the cycle
you be see those now
and so it be a little bit disappointing that a map to growth program that in its execution and positive impact be be disrupt
on the other hand there be a number of instance where I think the timing of certain thing be lucky and this be one of those
we cash conversion cycle be stronger than it be ever be
and we have effect close to of what we want to do in map to growth across every certainly across manufacturing and the procurement process by centralize we purchasing globally
probably less than in the G&A area because the last bigger piece of that will come once the erp implementation be complete
so the area that be most disrupt be get the continuous improvement discipline into we medium and smaller plant
and also complete the erp implementation that we have set to complete over the next 12 to 15 month
and those will be put off because they require in some instance a physical presence
but the gain that we have make have be solidify and will continue to benefit we
and it be be a really good program that be accelerate
Rusty provide detail of March
March be a repeat of what we have be show quarter after quarter
but obviously that will be it be we anticipation that that will be meaningfully disrupt in April and May
the last comment that I will make be if you believe what you read and you believe what you see on the ground it do appear as if April and May will be the most negatively impact period 60-day period as it relate to government-mandated shutdown and business disruption
and it will be interesting to see as we get into the summer month both globally and then in the United_States state by state how the reopen of the economy happen both in term of sector and speed
we have we next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research
Frank I appreciate the color on expected decline in April and May and obviously you year be off to a really good start
what be underpin what be you assumption in term of housing start and commercial construction activity in April and May that be underpin that 15 % to 20 % sale decline
so I can not answer that question
we have not go from a macro perspective into that
what we have do be talk to each of we business
we have look at the affect plant globally
we have have some affect plant in the United_States not surprisingly they have principally be manufacture facility in the New Jersey North Jersey area of kind of Metro New York and we have have shutdown we have quarantine people we have close the plant we have disinfect it clean it and bring people back
so we have be through that cycle
and it be not a good cycle to go through
but when you have do it once or twice you begin to develop a rhythm of understand the quarantine time the cleaning process and get people back to work
but we really have do it bottom-up company-by-company and a assessment of they sale force
and so in the consumer diy area there be not only be more people at home but at least temporarily there seem to be a shift from contractor do it for I to DIY and that will benefit we consumer diy business for instance
the only element of we consumer diy business that be impact by residential new construction would be the caulk and sealant segment of we dap business
we have not do a analysis of what that mean but that be the area in consumer that would be impact
the Construction Products Group continue to see spotty cycle of big order flow in roofing project and then stop
in we Performance Coatings Group we be build a solid with good customer basis in tech in food and beverage and in area that will I think perform well through this but some of that be be put off
and so I be not answer you question specifically other than to say that we have do this bottom up business unit by business unit and try to understand the order flow and the impact
and as I say earlier I think the only big market that we be very concerned about as a real challenge come be oil and gas
Understood
I understand the difficulty there
let I shift in you do mention that you be see a market share gain in the consumer business
I be wonder if you could expand upon that
and then speaking of consumer I be wonder if you be get any kind of instantaneous datum or what have you in term of the social distancing impact on the home center and hardware store
and be that have even though DIY should be a very positive trend
I mean I know that the time to get what you want at a home Depot have go exponentially higher
be you see any negative impact there in term of you business
I be sure the answer to that be yes
we would not talk about individual customer but some customer have institute more rigorous regimen of how many people they will let into they store
interestingly enough we online order be through the roof
and so in certain product category where we might get or online order a week
it could be hundred or
and so we be fulfil that and that be through we major retailer to a lesser extent
we actually do more online business through a number of we major retail customer than we do through Amazon but we Amazon business be grow
and then in Europe as part of we consumer diy business which have be more negatively impact particularly in the U.K. than in the U.S. because of some temporary business shutdown we have a business call VerdeCoat which be kind of a mro
it be a catalog now it be a mro online catalog business
and they business literally over the last month be up almost 100 %
it be a smaller piece of that but you be see a shift to online as well
all in all through March we have a high single digit low double digit pos across the entirety of we consumer segment customer base
and we have we next question from Rosemarie Morbelli with G.Research
I be just wonder Frank whether you could touch on the lower capex which what do you think the amount will be by year-end
and which be the project that you be eliminate
so we goal this_year be to spend about $ 180 million in CapEx
I think when we finish the_year we will be closer to $ 150 million
notably with a really strong cash_flow through 9 month that include a year over-year higher level of capex of about $ 20 million
so that give you a sense of the strong cash_flow that we be generate
for next year we preliminary budgeting be about $ 150 million in CapEx
and at this point in time I think we can pare that back by $ 25 million or $ 30 million without negatively interrupt we map to growth program or the area that we be grow
and if need be depend on circumstance we could pare that back further
but that be we current plan
okay
and when you be talk about most of you facility operate in the U.S. or in North_America altogether what be the capacity utilization
yes they be open but how much business be come out of there
it be very hard to say Rosemarie as I think we highlight either in Rusty 's comment or in we press_release it be circumstantial to each business
so if you be in the small project paint patch and repair particularly we cleaner category there be and I do not have they exactly
one of they be Krud Kutter Industrial another be a mean green antibacterial product
we have cleaning product through Rust Oleum that be certify as approve for clean surface relative to covid-19
those be through the roof
and the constraint there be raw material but we be continue to do that
the flip side be we marine coating business which be a smaller business as part of we Specialty Products Group
in total that be maybe a $ 25 million in revenue business
and we normally would not talk about SPU size but to put that in perspective
and many of they large marine product retailer and/or shipyard that do repair maintenance and recoat for yacht and boat be close
and so that be a business where revenue might at this point be impact as much as 50_%
but that be a temporary period and whether that last for another few week or another few month time will tell
and if I may sneak another one in
with q4 revenue down 15 % what could be the impact on you bottom line
and that be link to the marine business be down 50_%
and I think if I be not wrong that it have a very high margin
sure
we do not as Rusty say we be suspend guidance
and at this point we be look at expense reduction expense deferral cutback in capital spending take advantage of a few of the thing that be in the CARES Act that apply to larger business
one example be a deferral of fica tax
we be look at thing like that to really drive cash flow generation
and that be very much we focus
I think the map to growth program will allow we to generate better bottom line income than we otherwise would have in the face of revenue decline
but beyond that we be not in a position really to talk about earnings or earnings per share or any projection around that for the_quarter
and we have we next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America
Frank what be the time lag and frequency by which you receive sale datum from the big box home center on you consumer product
and let I just see how you answer that one first
sure
I be pretty certain that in most category we consumer business get that information on a weekly basis
and can you tell whether or not the home center be place order for inventory restocking that be commensurate with that
or do you sense any change in stock level as they look forward into these next couple of month
it literally be week by week
so you question be spot on in term of the thing that we be pay to pay attention to
there will be some interesting new dynamics for all of we relative to learn how to work from home
and I say that because we have a senior leader meeting every other day at the end of the day
and we talk about code infection if there be any fortunately as we statistics show they be not many and they have be sporadic
and they have actually mostly be in the New Jersey area for we
and we talk about impact we operation but we also talk about every other day what be go_on order flow impact
so we have some good insight into that
it be very circumstantial
some of we retail customer be show a solid pos in the early part of April or what we would forecast for the early part of April here
some of they be show level that be below where we be in March and we think that have more to do with deliberate decision to limit the traffic flow into they store than it do with actually demand
and then lastly as I indicate earlier it be very spotty
we be sell all the cleaning and disinfect product that we can make
that be true at we Legend Brands business as well
and so that be a area that maybe by July we will have a better sense of what we can say in some detail about the different diy product category and what be really move the needle
and on that 6 % organic growth that you post in the fiscal third quarter in the consumer segment be that mostly volume
and can you comment on the outlook for price give moderate raw
sure
it be mostly volume
as you see give the strong volume there and in we consumer I be sorry in we construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group the leverage to the bottom line have be a little less in we consumer business in part because we have be face some unique raw material challenge there
some of which be now abate
the biggest one be packaging in certain area
and so it be in all of those segment construction product and consumer product the unit volume growth have be really solid
in the Performance Coatings Group the actual unit volume growth through 9 month have be better than the number show because they have be very deliberate in pair back lower-margin product category and in close some lower-margin or breakeven international business
so as we indicate we have shed close to $ 60 million or $ 70 million on a annualize basis deliberately in this reorganization
and that be be disproportionately in we Performance Coatings Group and we construction Products Group not in consumer
although there be some come in consumer with some overseas business that do not meet we margin criterion
and so it be be very solid organic growth
we have we next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird
Frank you make some comment about obviously employee mobility impact some of you map to growth initiative
clearly you customer be go to be impact by the same dynamic and presumably will be even as the economy start to gradually open up
I be just curious from a segment standpoint how should we think about this dynamic as it relate to customer qualification of you product for future capital project et_cetera
how be you sort of adapt towards this new normal if you want to call it that
sure
and so in we construction Products business I think we be fortunate both in every segment of rpm because of the benefit of map to growth
but if you think about where we have be strong so while we in general and to you question I do think that there will be a reduction for a period of time in industrial capital spending
and certainly outside of oil and gas which be part of that a little more than $ 200 million but there be probably $ 0.5 billion of we revenue that be drive by industrial capital spending or major project
but again it be circumstantial
we Stonhard business have be a lead provider globally include the application portion of it of polymer flooring with a real strong presence in food beverage hospital fab plant and so area of the economy that we think be go to do pretty well
the interesting anecdote be we Stonhard business that be cast by a major contractor to put together the hygienic flooring in the hospital temporary hospital facility that be go to be set up in Central Park in New York
and we get that order
it be under strict requirement relative to timing
we have get the material and the applicator there
and then good news relatively quickly that order get cut in half because it seem as if the anticipated need of the number of bed space for this temporary hospital spot in New York City be not go to be need
I hope that be true
but that give you a sense of why we think over time that segment will do well
we Tremco roofing business have be the leader in North_America in these long-term high-performing restoration roofing project
and what they have be very good at be be able to dry out a old roof as oppose to tear it off and then apply a roof restoration coating and extend the life of a or 40-year-old roof for another 10 to 20 year
that be at of the cost of rip off and replace with new material a old roof
surely we will be see enhance competition there but we be the leader there
and I say that because I think that the negative impact in that sector for we will be more on the rip off and OEM replacement
we do not play in that space
95 % of we Tremco roofing business have be reroof
and so without filibuster the call here we have look at oil and gas that will be a problem
we have look at $ 0.5 billion drive by industrial capital spending because clearly we be go to be cut ours and other will do the same
and it be circumstantial
but in a lot of case I think we be in a pretty good position
okay
that be super helpful
and Frank I know you do not want to give guidance completely understandable
but as you kind of think back to the financial crisis what be the initial decremental cost
obviously you be in a position of strength with map to growth and the momentum there
so just curious as to what transpire back then
and then second as you kind of think about disruption risk yourselve give the fluid operating environment how should we think about work capital
will that be will you build up a little bit more inventory as part of you safety stock for supply you customer
or do you still expect work capital to be a benefit this_year to the extent that it have be
sure
so when you go back to and ' 09 we fiscal year could not have model the great recession any better
we start we fiscal year in June of ' 08 and we finish we fiscal year on May 31 of ' 09
so we pretty much model the beginning of the financial crisis and then when people start to feel okay
in that period of time we sale be down 7 % and we adjusted net income be off a little more than 35 %
we have we best cash flow year ever
in fiscal sale on a consolidated basis recover by about 1 % and earnings net income and eps be up 25 % on adjusted basis
and so we have a strong recovery and that be not inconsistent with kind of the the recovery that many people have
I think we cash conversion cycle be better now thanks to the timing of map to growth
I do think while we will build up some safety stock in a few area I do think through a combination of map to growth and in some case reduce volume you will see work capital as a contributor to cash generation in the coming quarter
as I have comment we we look bottom-up the entrepreneurial nature of RPM in term of how we serve we customer be still alive and well and will suit we well in term of flexibility
and this be a big picture perspective
but contrary to what some people expect I do not see a v for global economy here
I see a u and I think that U will be shorter for some and longer for other depend on and all of you know this better than we do on the impact of this pandemic which have be devastate to certain industry and hospitality for instance and have be helpful to some unique business relative to clean product
but for we I see a improved performance as we get into we new fiscal year relative to we conservatively negative expectation for q4
but I think for everybody we be look at a U recovery not a V.
and we have we next question from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan
I be wonder if I could do like a similar exercise like look at like what happen in ' 09
and what sort of like happen be that in the February and May quarter the organic growth be sort of like down 10_% or 15 % which be why you guidance make really make sense
and if you look at it by the vision though like one of the thing that happen be that both of the industrial business which be now you construction you Performance Coatings business they be down maybe in term of volume like 12 % in the February quarter and then 19 % in the May quarter
but the consumer business have similar result
the consumer business in February be down 14 % in volume and maybe 19 % in the May quarter
and in part it have to do that there be a financial crisis and people could not spend money
and like somehow it feel like something similar be go on now where a lot of people will be unemployed and like a of the people do not pay a rent for April
and so one of the question be that when we model down this like 10 % to 15 % should that really be stick into all the segment rather than say well consumer be down 5 % and everything else be down 20_%
sure
I be
I think this be different from the financial crisis
and so I do not have in front of I the detail by segment
we have segment back then
and so I can not be specific to that
but I can tell you in the_third_quarter we consumer segment tank and we literally anecdotally be talk about shoot canon down the aisle of we big customer include home center like Walmart and not hit anybody
and so for a very short period of time during the financial crisis consumer stop buy everything
and I think the fear there be that at some point they be go to go to they ATM and nothing be go to come out
that ease up very quickly
I think what we be see now be very different
we be see pretty steady on a segment basis but spiky base on different product category business activity
but it do speak Silke to the comment I make earlier we do not anticipate a v recovery for we and for anybody
I do think that there will be even as economy recover even as these mandate government restriction be ease I do think that there will be a period of time in which economic activity from where we be a year ago will be somewhat subdue
okay
so you be more of a believer that if you look at the and then I do not mean to criticize just try to understand
so like you view be that there be probably a lot more from you point of view there would be like a lot more headwind on the construction Performance group business in term of negative volume in the May quarter and a lot less on the consumer side
no I think in the May quarter it be we expectation that there will be less negative impact in we consumer segment than in we other segment
that be correct
the one that be the spikiest for we right_now be Construction Products Group because we be see day of year-over-year record order flow and then day of cricket
and so it be very spiky
so it be hard to know
okay
that be helpful
and then just a question of clarification on the map to growth product program
if you realize $ 21 million in savings year-over-year in the_third_quarter do one annualize and say the run rate savings be like $ 85 million or $ 84 million for the_year
be that the way to look at it
yes
the savings we be talk to be the incremental year-over-year savings of $ 21 million
and those change each quarter
we cumulative savings we use to report in the_past but we find it would be more helpful for analyst to discuss the_quarter and the increment
yes
and so back to we original goal of $ 290 million in savings
in term of the manufacturing piece the procurement piece and the G&A piece we be on track for the G&A piece
but that slow down
we be ahead of both of the manufacturing and procurement piece relative to we original $ 200 million $ 290 million goal
there have be some offset to that
FX have hurt we in way we do not anticipate slower growth have hurt we
but we be through plant closure out of a plan
we be through $ 60 million to $ 70 million of either business or product line rationalization the continuous improvement activity in we plant by the time we be do this with this will exceed we original goal meaningfully
so if you will recall we have $ 75 million of target map to growth goal in the manufacturing area split roughly between the impact of footprint consolidation and continuous improvement
we will achieve the half from footprint consolidation
and we will have ten of million of dollar of more out of the continuous improvement effort by the time we be do and that will be incrementally continue
so all of those have be go quite well for we and they be pretty well embedded
the momentum if as you guy have point out year in a 3-year restructuring program be the easiest with the lowest hanging fruit
well year have go exceedingly well and we momentum be continue to build my biggest disappointment and again it be a trite statement in light of what be happen in the world be that momentum now have be a little bit disrupt
and we have we next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley
I just want to ask in the fourth quarter sale guidance what be the impact you have in there for foreign exchange and for M&A just so that we can kind of get to the true organic range that you be look for
yes that be a great question
and we be try to take into account fx
and again I mention that we talk to the senior leadership team every other day
and the fx swing in develop country currency be nut
so in Latin America you be see 30 % 40 % plus negative impact
I would remind folk that that be about $ 300 million of revenue in total
yes
yes
and so it be not huge but and then you can see the strength of the dollar versus the euro and the canadian dollar and the pound which be other bigger currency
so we be anticipate that in this guidance for the_fourth_quarter
the acquisition activity will be very modest as you see in the_third_quarter
so but we do not anticipate
in some prior quarter acquisition activity at 1 % or 2 % have acquisition positive impact
so if we think like 3 % to 5 % for FX be that in the ballpark keep in mind that it be a move target
yes
that would be we best guess right_now
I think that be good math but who know
okay
and then I just want to clarify one other thing
you call out the $ 200 million of oil and gas expose revenue and the $ 500 million tie to industrial customer capex that you be obviously quite concerned about for easy-to-understand reason
be there another subset of revenue at all that you would have the same concern about or slightly less concern about
or I be just try to clearly consumer we can tell there be a good diy opportunity there and the sustainability of it we can all debate or be it pull forward or whatever
but I be just try to as they think through the broader bucket just want to make sure that there be not some other area of revenue where you be as concern as industrial capex spend in oil and gas
yes
those be the biggest one that I think be appropriate to point out to we investor to say look these be the big pot that we be pay attention to
and we have provide some color as to why we think we will ride through for instance a industrial capital spending or big maintenance spending better than most
then it be anecdotal
I mention the Marine Coatings business that mostly pleasure marine and yacht
and it be a smaller business but because of the shutdown of they customer base and boatyard we anticipate they revenue could be half in the_fourth_quarter of what they be a year ago
it be anybody 's guess as to when those retailer and those boatyard open up as to whether we have a modest recovery
or depend on the health circumstance if everybody be happy to put they boat back in the water and there be a little bit of a spike in order flow from what be be a very economic impact of coronavirus related shutdown on that business
so we just we be monitor business unit by business unit to try and assess those same question
but we have highlight in the call today the big area that we be pay attention to and we think investor should as well
we have we next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities
you mention I think primarily in performance the $ 60 million to $ 70 million worth of product line where you have be shed some lower-margin business
can we just give a little bit of a sense on kind of where you be in those action and when you start to lap those action
and then I think you reference some similar action in other segment include consumer
have you start on those already
or be those action yet to come in other segment
so yes the answer to that be we start on those but they impact will be in the_future
and I would anticipate by the time we be do with we map to growth program that on the $ 60 million to $ 70 million million to come and maybe a little bit more
and that would come mostly outside of we Performance Coatings Group and we construction Products Group
so it would be a little bit in specialty and some principally some far away overseas operation in we consumer segment
all right
and then just in term of the map to growth the area that be be disrupt or delay
what be some of the thing that you can still move forward on
and what be you stick wait until people can travel more freely
and then I guess the second issue behind that be should we think of that delay as just once the stay-at-home order be lift you will get back to work
or will it take time to ramp those activity back up
and so it could be longer after the stay-at-home order be lift
sure
and so I will highlight that from a cash flow perspective first
at in the first year of we map to growth program we be probably spend upward of $ 30 million in outside consulting fee and related map to growth fee
that be down or be down to about $ 4 million or $ 5 million on a annualize basis
and very quickly about or 4 week ago we harden all we manufacturing facility in all we location
and so if you be a nonessential employee that include I you do not belong in we plant and that include outside contractor
and so the idea of have smaller consultant that be help we with good idea
so the people that have be work with we team and we be now get down to the kind of mid to smaller-sized manufacturing facility to institute what we call fit event and these continuous improvement discipline have be halt
I can assure you they be all eager to get back go
I have no idea when the world will be ready and we will be ready to turn the green light on that
but I can assure you the second we be those consultant be go to be eager to get back to work because when we halt they activity we halt they payment
the same thing be true on some accounting consolidation and erp consolidation activity to the extent that we have fee that would be generate with payback that be let 's say over a 3-year period all that activity be halt
and so if we do not see a payback on some of the activity even that we can do remotely that be inside of a year those program have be stop both practically because we can not put people into we facility personally and financially because some of the activity that we be go to have a payout which be a good irr but still a payout longer than or 3 year have be halt
and I would tell you the thing that all good company be think about be capital structure cash_flow and liquidity and cash generation
so in thing large like reduce plan capex by $ 25 million or $ 30 million with the belief that we could do more and thing small like every $ 50,000 or $ 500,000 contract with a outside consultant they be all be cancel or delay
we have we next question from Josh Spector with UBS
just on the raw material front
you guy talk about more moderate raw material inflation not necessarily decline
I be wonder if you could provide some more color on where you be see increase
and related to that if oil kind of stay where it be which I know be a big if what point would you start to expect to see some of those savings flow through the P&L
great question
and so initially we be see some tightening in certain raw material category and availability have seem to ease off
the flip side be over the last year or so one of the category that be define raw material deflation be metal packaging
and I would anticipate with what be happen globally in certain category that maybe we will finally see some relief in that category
so it be be circumstantial around different category
there be no doubt that with oil price be where they be if they settle into a sustained area that there will be some solvent and resin category that will see some decrease in cost versus where we sit today
that be helpful
and I guess related to that as we look across the different segment if raw material be to decline meaningfully how quickly would you expect price to react in the industrial and construction segment
and maybe converse to that how slow would pricing react in Consumer segment
it be really hard to say at this point in time
we be hold on to the pricing that we have be able to affect over the last 1.5 year
we need that because of a 2.5-year cyclical raw material increase
we be not back to where we be in term of that mix 2.5 year ago
but at this point most of we customer be focus on supply fill rate they need it
and it be be a supply_chain across industry have have to be more nimble because of the spikiness of order flow
and so that be where we be today
we do not have a good I do not have a good answer to that question
and I do not think that that will really unfold for another quarter or
we next question be from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets
I just want to understand I guess when you look at you commentary that some of you international location be close so should we expect I guess the greatest decline in you q4 sale in both construction product and industrial
be that the right way to think about it
yes
so we Performance Coatings Group and we construction Products Group what be formerly we industrial segment have we greatest exposure to market outside of North_America
and Europe be see have be see weak demand as we have be communicate for a year
we have have some spot of brightness there in the last couple of quarter
but not quite half of we european operation be have be close at one time or another
so there be be more aggressive government-mandated closure in various country in Europe than we have see in North_America
and so as I comment earlier it be true throughout Latin America and India and those be predominantly Performance Coatings and Construction Product Group business
okay
and so I guess just try to understand how this work
I mean when you guy do take a plant down I think you note that be about 6 % of you sale potentially that be affect by closed plant
be it effectively that whole 6 % be lose
or be it be you kind of think that maybe 50_% of that amount be lose
and how do that relate to the inventory I guess do you guy already have inventory on hand to potentially service some customer
or be it just kind of stop for the time the plant be down
no no that be correct
I mean we have inventory on hand
and depend on the nature of the different business we can cover close-downs without much disruption for as long as or 30 day
after that you inventory depletion base on certain product category can be problematic in one particular formula or color versus other
but it be very circumstantial to plant
as I say we have a plant in Norway that be close as part of we Performance Coatings Group that be be reopen
we split a single a marine coating single shift plant into shift
we have a infection on a shift
we close the plant for 2 day aggressively disinfect it and quarantine the shift of the people that be work with the individual that be infected and bring back the other shift that be not
and so I could give you a plant-by-plant circumstance
I think all company who be operate be become much more nimble as to how to segregate shift how to do cleaning between shift how to under we have a plant where a contractor who be into repair equipment be diagnose with coronavirus and he have be in that plant 10 day prior
and we do not know it for 10 day
we close the plant
it be actually a plant currently close and we be close it for 6 day
we be clean that plant and that be 6 day plus the 10 day when the last time the contractor be in there it be a 16-day period
interestingly the plant that have be affect in the United_States be all metropolitan New York New Jersey area
and from what we can tell they have be all at-home infection because we have not not have any hotspot and we effort to close a plant clean it and then bring people back in the appropriate circumstantial
inventory play a big part have a protocol by which you understand how quickly you can get back in business
and then understand what the government mandate we so for instance we be close in we major plant in India
and they be set to reopen in another couple of week that closure could be extend
and we do not know yet
there be be closure in other country that have occur and then we have have reopening
okay
so I guess it all depend on how long the plant be down for
so I guess just a follow-up
so typically I guess the inventory level that you do keep at various plant that also vary
but or should we assume it be kind of maybe at least maybe 30 day or so
so if there be a 30-day shutdown maybe you can manage through that
or be that the right way to think about it
it vary business by business but I do think that in almost all of we business we could get by for a period of 20 to 30 day
but after that you begin to negatively impact you ability to supply customer particularly in more uniquer product category
yes
we have not see at this point nor do we anticipate any closure anywhere of 30 day or more but circumstance could be different in different part of the world
Great
and just lastly similarly on the supply_chain
so I know a couple of year back you have some issue with source MMA maybe out of Asia and some other raw
have any of that transpire
do you expect any of that
be that kind of factored into you statement about maybe not expect as much of a tailwind from the raw side
or how be you think about the supply_chain for you input cost
yes we try and pay attention to that every day
I comment earlier on silicone which be a issue a few week back
seem to be okay today
clean product and this one should not be a surprise
clean product raw material be a issue
and we get what we need relative to past allocation
in some case we can not get what we need to meet a explosive demand
and so that be a product category that we pay attention to a lot
that impact some of we consumer business
so those category be significantly ahead of prior year
but in certain circumstance it may not be meet demand because of raw material supply
the same be true in we Legend Brands business that make hepa filter equipment and filter and industrial disinfecting and cleaning product include product that be sell into hospital
that be before all this happen and we could sell more of those product if we could get more raw material
we have we next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research
I just want to probe a little bit more on the subject of decremental margin
as you look across the portfolio be there business that would stand out to you as have unusual ratio of fix versus variable cost on either end of the spectrum
try to get a handle on how we might take some of these larger-than-normal sale variance and then take that down to the bottom line during this period of dislocation
sure
I do not know that that be particularly true in general across RPM
obviously every business have its own breakeven point
if it be truer in certain segment than other it would be in we specialty segment
and so you have business like we DayGio fluorescent color business or other specialty segment business that have lower-than-average gross margin but higher-than-average ebit margin
and so they do have a fixed point there
you be already see that in the revenue challenge that we have be have in the last couple of quarter in we Specialty Products Group
those number would have be somewhat worse be it not for the map to growth program
but in general when you look across we construction Products Group you look across we Performance Coatings Group there be a high level of variability between raw material cost which obviously be variable to sale and probably represent 40 % of we p&l and selling cost which depend on the business be split maybe between fixed and variable or fix and variable but a pretty high level of variability in a lot of we business
okay
that be helpful
and then Frank I want to ask have suspend the share repurchase which I expect a lot of company will do
what be you current view on M&A
have you hit the pause button there as well
or do you see some opportunity with lower multiple for example
sure
well we have hit the pause button on that
we be look at a couple of smaller-sized transaction that be all but do and I think we be work with those business on what to do in term of timing and other item
but in term of new transaction I think we cash_flow that have be devote to look at acquisition and/or repurchase we stock
and as you can see we cash flow generation be better than it be ever be will be devote to continue we operation maintain we dividend and everything else to repay debt
we have we last question from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research
as you obviously the coronavirus have impact the U.S. in different place at different time in different degree and the state have respond differently in term of how they be prohibit construction activity
so as we look at do you have any visibility in term of the state that be most prohibitive in term of construction like New York Michigan place like that
how you construction end market be do versus other part of the country where there be less prohibitive restriction in place
just curious if you have any visibility and can separate between the different region there
sure
for the most part construction activity in general and particularly as it relate to infrastructure be up and run throughout North_America
the most state be follow the Department of Homeland Security guideline which qualify construction activity as essential
the state that I be aware of and this could be different in other place
the state that I be aware of that have the harshest focus on construction be Pennsylvania and the construction industry work with the Governor 's office to talk about PPE protocol and social distancing and what be happen in other state
and within a week or 10 day the original halt of construction activity in Pennsylvania be ease
and I believe now Pennsylvania be follow the Department of Homeland Security guideline on construction
we see a similar order in Québec province of Canada and that have also be ease somewhat
the rest maintenance of certain PPE and social distancing protocol
in a number of we area it be truer than most
when you be do roofing activity or you be in the usl business and you activity be outside or outdoors I think there be less concern if you be do flooring work and you can maintain all those protocol
again I mention spiky business
one of the reason we be see spiky business in that business activity be it require the shutdown of a manufacturing operation to get in and do rehab and/or replacement of floor whether it be manufacture facility institutional facility and in particular for roofing school and university
those all have closure area that be allow for some of the construction activity that we do
and so we will see whether that be be beneficial for we or perhaps be pull some summer work into the_fourth_quarter
but it be very spiky and we will report the result in July when we have we fourth quarter result final
okay
Great
and then on the DIY side the strength that you be see there what be you sense
I mean be this something you believe be more of a near-term phenomenon as people be have stay-at-home order in place that they be look for thing to do go to Home Depot and do a small project themselves
or and when those order be lift that maybe we get back to normal
or be this a trend that you think could last for a while as maybe people do not want contractor come into home and look to do thing themselves
just curious you thought there
sure
it really depend
I think that this will be somewhat spiky now because people be at home and they when they be tire of watch Netflix they can get at the small project paint or home decorating and repair activity that they want
there be a decide shift to people do it themselves as oppose to have outside contractor come in and do it for they
it would be nice to think that thing would revert back to normal
so a slower level of pos perhaps when the world get back to more normal
this go without say
I think some of it depend on how quickly medical advance save the day if you will
and if that do not happen and for instance in the United_States we be see a meaningful and sustained unemployment rate that be 10_% 12 % which some people believe for a period of time
that will negatively impact we diy business over time
but all of that circumstantial to what be come this summer and this fall related to the impact of the coronavirus and how quickly people can get back to work and what the medical outcome relative to vaccine or treatment be
thank you
I will now turn the call back over to Frank Sullivan for close remark
thank you very much Vanessa
I would like to thank we associate around the world for they effort

thank you Ed and good morning
I will review we financial result for we third quarter and first 9 month of fiscal year_2020 follow by a review of we cash position
first I be pleased to say that the company report a operating income of $ 11,000 for the_third_quarter of_fiscal as compare to a operating loss of $ 0.8 million in the third quarter of last year
while total company net sale for the_third_quarter of_fiscal year_2020 decrease 2 % to $ 38.2 million compare to the prior year 's third quarter of $ 39.0 million net sale for Canvys increase for the_third_quarter of_fiscal year_2020 by $ 0.3 million or 3.5 %
sale of semiconductor wafer fab equipment specialty product also increase from last year 's third quarter
PMT net sale benefit from higher sale of power conversion in rf and microwave component although overall sale for PMT decrease $ 0.7 million or 2.5 %
this be primarily due to economic softness in the power grid tube market and lower sale in China due to the coronavirus
Richardson Healthcare net sale decrease $ 0.2 million or 11.9 % as a result of lower sale of equipment in Latin America and noncore diagnostic imaging part partially offset by higher sale of we alta750 ct Tube which grow by 135 % over the prior year 's third quarter
Gross margin for the_quarter improve to 33.1 % of net sale compare to 31.5 % of net sale in last year 's third quarter
this be primarily due to a favorable product mix and improve manufacturing performance in both PMT and Richardson Healthcare
Canvys gross margin of 32.8 % be the same as last year 's third quarter
operating_expense decrease to $ 12.7 million for the_third_quarter of_fiscal compare to $ 13.1 million in the_third_quarter of_fiscal
the decrease in operating_expense result from lower severance legal and professional service expense partially offset by higher research and development expense for Richardson Healthcare as we invest in additional CT x-ray tube type
as I mention the company report a operating income of $ 11,000 for the_third_quarter of_fiscal as compare to a operating loss of $ 0.8 million in the third quarter of last year
this be a result of the improve gross margin and lower operating_expense
other income for the_third_quarter of_fiscal include interest income and foreign exchange be $ 0.1 million compare to other income of less than $ 0.1 million in the_third_quarter of_fiscal
the income tax provision of $ 0.2 million for the_quarter reflect a provision for foreign income tax which be lower than in the prior year 's third quarter and the U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance record against the net operating loss
although there be no tax benefit show on we financial statement from U.S. net operating loss we can use we net operating loss to offset any cash tax liability report in we U.S. federal income tax return
the amount of federal nol be $ 15.4 million
overall we have a net loss of $ 0.1 million for the_third_quarter of_fiscal as compare to a net loss of $ 1.1 million in the_third_quarter of_fiscal
turn to a review of the result for the first 9 month of fiscal year_2020

sale for Richardson Healthcare of $ 7 million be the same as last_year
Gross margin increase to 32.3 % from 31.5 % primarily reflect favorable product mix in Richardson Healthcare and improve manufacturing performance for both PMT and Healthcare
operating_expense be $ 38.7 million for the first 9 month of the fiscal year which represent a decrease of $ 0.9 million from the first 9 month of the last fiscal year
the decrease be due to lower severance legal and professional service expense partially offset by higher research and development expense for Richardson Healthcare

other income for the first 9 month of fiscal include interest income and foreign exchange be $ 0.2 million the same as for the first 9 month of fiscal
the income tax provision of $ 0.4 million for the first 9 month of fiscal primarily reflect a provision for foreign income tax and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance record against the net operating loss
overall we have a net loss of $ 0.6 million for the first 9 month of fiscal year_2020 compare to a net loss of $ 1.0 million in the first 9 month of_fiscal year 2019
we continue to closely manage we cash position
cash and investment at the end of the third quarter of_fiscal be $ 43.9 million compare to $ 46.1 million at the end of the second quarter of_fiscal and $ 49.4 million at the end of the third quarter of_fiscal
Capital expenditure be $ 0.4 million in the_third_quarter of_fiscal compare to $ 1.0 million in the_third_quarter of_fiscal year 2019 approximately $ 0.2 million related to we it system $ 0.1 million be for facility project and another $ 0.1 million be for we manufacturing business

total cash repatriate for the first 9 month of fiscal be $ 7.5 million
U.S. cash be $ 27.4 million at the end of the third quarter of_fiscal
now I will turn the call over to Greg who will discuss the result for we Power & Microwave Technologies group
thank you Bob and good morning everyone
PMT sale in third quarter of_fiscal year_2020 be $ 28.9 million versus $ 29.7 million in q3 fy ' 19
we gross margin improve in the_quarter to 32.8 % versus 31.6 % in the_prior_year and we reduce we SG&A in the_quarter
q3 sale when compare to prior year be mainly impact by the year-over-year sale decline in we legacy Tube business a issue related to covid-19 in China
however this decline be partially offset by continue strong growth and we new technology partner support the rf and power market and increase sale with we semiconductor wafer fab customer
another positive trend be we book-to-bill
btb be x and be drive by strong booking from we wafer fab customer c tube product line and we PMG business unit
we booking growth in we edg business unit be base on continued engineering and logistic support of the wafer fab market and global infrastructure to support we OEM and MRO customer
the growth in PMG booking be due to we new technology partner product we demand creation model we numerous design win in high-growth market and a unique global business model
we continue to improve we global go-to-market strategy by invest in key business development resource to greatly improve and increase we customer contact in a more efficient manner
as the market condition dictate we continue to manage we SG&A and invest in key growth area
we also continue to implement strategy to improve we efficiency and increase we customer contact
these action allow we to generate more opportunity in grow market use we exist global infrastructure and head count
this will have a positive impact on we performance for the balance of the_year and into the_future
we revenue growth with we new technology be be support by key partner such as Qorvo MACOM Anokiwave United Silicon ISM and Fuji Semiconductor
we core legacy business continue to be greatly support by the key tube manufacturer in the industry such as CPI Thales NJRC and Photonis
of course covid-19 be have a net effect on q4
as of this date there have not be any large pushout or cancellation
we be in consistent communication with we supplier and customer
we be very excite about the booking trend in both business unit however we know that there will be a adjustment period at some point in which the customer will adjust they backlog as they get more datum on the global status of covid-19
it be interesting though as I have talk to all of you about 5g opportunity for the past few year and spend my career roll out 3g 4g and now 5g infrastructure to increase the ability to be mobile and communicate and manage datum throughout the world
with there be a shortage of so many item with this pandemic what we be not short on be bandwidth in wireless communication
Wireless infrastructure be not put in over the_year for this event
however I start to think what we would be deal with if everyone in the world immediately work from they home and manage they business and communicate without the implementation of 3g 4g and now 5g infrastructure
we be able to take we entire organization on a global basis and get they start to work from the safety of they home within hour after we implement the stay-home policy
when we get through this I believe there will be a major expedite of get 5g capability throughout the world and Richardson be very well position to support it
I can not stress enough the value of Richardson Electronics unparalleled capability and global go-to-market strategy that be unique to the power and rf and microwave industry
we world-leading position in the manufacturing and distribution of electronic device support the legacy equipment as well as new equipment where solid-state can not replace tube
the combination of these niche strategy separate we from we competition and have prove successful
once this virus be control we feel we be definitely in the right market and have the right strategy to support the opportunity as they arise
with that I will turn it over to Wendy Diddell in Richardson Healthcare
thanks Greg and good morning everyone
revenue generate from ct in the_third_quarter of fy increase 135 % over last year 's third quarter
while we do not report the actual number of tube sell or install we be happy to note that the number of ALTA tube sell during the_quarter increase over prior year and over we most recent second quarter
we average selling price for the alta750 decline slightly during the_quarter as we push customer to try we tube over new and used oem tube
while we be happy with the increase we all agree more would be better
we longest-life tube be now near 700 day
total healthcare sale in the_third_quarter be below prior year due primarily to the continue significant decline in equipment sale
this be the result of ongoing economic issue throughout Latin and South America
nearly all of we customer in these region remain under financial pressure
this market will come back and we will be ready to support it when it do
in the interim we speak regularly to all of we customer throughout the region and help they with critical part supply and technical support
Gross margin in the_third_quarter be 38.3 % of sale a fantastic improvement over 26.2 % in q3 last_year
the improvement be due to product mix as well as improvement in manufacturing
Producing CT tube be a very difficult business
company who have be do this for decade be constantly challenge by the operational demand place on the product
Manufacturing tube require extreme and continual high level of equipment and personnel performance
there be very little margin for error
with we team of experienced engineer and production technician the majority of whom come from lead CT tube manufacturer we be confident we will continue to find solution to improve we internal yield and increase the performance of we tube
this along with put additional tube type into production will help drive margin up in the_future
throughout the_quarter we apply a full-court press to generate sale of the alta750
we reach out to every former current and potential tube customer include service provider and end user
we confirm ct system under contract and remind everyone of the benefit of use we tube
now we wait for a tube to fill on a scanner that be not cover under a service contract
we be prepared and will continue to stay in front of we customer
now fast forward several week and we be face with a unprecedented challenge
covid-19 have bring much of we proactive selling effort to a halt
face-to-face meeting have be put on hold and most hospital personnel be not take sale call
however this be a short-term issue
we have all read and be question if tube sale will increase with the use of CT scan to help diagnose the virus
in fact right_now the opposite may be true
many of we third-party service provider be tell we that they have see a drop in service call volume in recent week
that be because hospital have cancel all noncritical surgery and they be close nonessential medical facility so that all resource be ready and available for coronavirus patient
this too be expect to be short-term with a spike in demand when covid-19 be under control
again we be ready with part and tube
throughout this period we be still offer technical support and man we product helpline
we be spend regular e-mail reminder to everyone in we database so they know where to turn when a part or tube be need
we be check in with we service partner and offer assistance
so far we carrier be operate business as usual and we have a team of people make sure we part be ready to ship no matter what time of the day or night they be need
we best wish go out to those fight on the front line of the pandemic
we thank they for they service and for put themselves at risk to take care of other
as a essential business we engineering and production team continue with development and manufacturing
they be either work remote or in the plant under social distance guideline
we be work closely with we supplier
those that initially close due to shelter-in-place directive have reopen to support essential business such as ours
we have have some prototype delay due to coronavirus-related personnel issue outside of Richardson Healthcare
we anticipate this will push testing of the g tube to early fall with we launch plan for late January 2021
so just a short delay
we effort to develop a process for repair a third tube be also underway and we be explore way to expedite release
in both case it be more important to get the tube right than to launch too early
finally we continue to work with regulatory body in other country include China Korea and Russia as well as smaller country such as the Ukraine
we be also work to ensure that we have both U.S. and EU approval for the g tube at the time of launch
we appreciate you ongoing support as well as you patience
at this point I will turn the call over to Jens Ruppert to discuss third quarter result for Canvys
thanks wendy and good morning everyone
Canvys which include the engineering manufacture and sale of custom display to original equipment manufacturer in industrial and medical market deliver strong performance with sale of $ 7.2 million during the_third_quarter of_fiscal a increase of 3.5 % over the same period last_year
the revenue increase for the_quarter be relate to increase customer demand in North_America
Gross margin as a percentage of net sale be 32.8 % during the_third_quarter of_fiscal the same as during the_third_quarter of_fiscal
q3 fiscal be another strong quarter for canvy with a book-to-bill of x
we be able to increase we backlog again to a all-time high in recent history
we backlog consist of purchase order that typically ship over or more year
customer issue call off order that vary quarter-to-quarter base on customer demand component availability and other factor
the healthy backlog position along with the number of project that be currently in the engineering stage position we well for continued growth
during the_quarter we receive several new order from both exist and first-time medical oem customer
application where we display be use be numerous
some of these include cryolipolysis system that break down fat cell by cool off body fat refractive surgery a laser system for therapeutic and refractive application of cutting-edge corneal surgery patient monitoring where we monitor be install at patient bed or remote location such as central nurse station medical device control capture high-resolution image and live video from up to surgical imaging device radiotherapy where highly customize display be use to monitor the patient during the radiation treatment diagnostic monochrome display that be DICOM compliant high-definition display use for endoscopy application human-machine interface for electrosurgical device electrosurgery be application of high-frequency alternate polarity electrical current through biological tissue as a means to cut and coagulate tissue precisely and with limited blood loss and dental treatment center where patient can review radiographic image or live video from a intraoral camera or other video feed such as educational or video or promotion
in the nonmedical space we receive order for various display and all-in-one product
application include this place with a embedded rfid reader and usb hub use as human-machine interface for surface inspection machine human-machine interface for ticket machine in public transportation sector and tailor prompter talent monitor and clock use in the broadcast market for popular news station around the world
we continue to look for new customer through trade show online marketing referral and cold calling
the lcd and flat-panel industry have be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak as china-based manufacturer have major production line in Wuhan the epicenter of the epidemic
the epidemic have disrupt production across almost all information and communication technology sector lead many firm without component and material supplies
the chip resistor inventory for example have reach a 10-year low level
we lead time have be impact as well and we do not see they come back to normal soon
the impact of the coronavirus outbreak be expect to affect it all up to 20_% in the global flat panel output
it be difficult to quantify the impact specifically to we business at this time
we do expect some customer pushout
while several of we customer be consider essential business like we be they be operate on a reduced output basis for now
many other be close
consider all the new program we be work on with exist as well as new customer
I be optimistic that we will continue grow we business once we be past the effect of the coronavirus
we have prove ourselves to be a highly reliable versatile technology company with the ability to meet a diverse number of display requirement as well as be in compliance with the upcoming of mdr
we offer we key customer safety stock option enable they to react quickly on unexpected increase demand and help bridge interruption in the supply_chain such as we be see with the coronavirus
I will regularly review and adjust we business strategy with the goal of further improve the operating performance of the division take into consideration any change that result from a extended epidemic
for now we remain ready to serve we customer and play a important role in supply chain management for critical industry such as healthcare manufacturing and transportation
I will now turn the call back over to Ed
thanks Jens for a excellent quarter
I want to thank all the Richardson employee globally for continue to focus on the business while pay attention to the safety precaution establish by the CDC and the World Health Organization
as a essential business we be ask a lot from we employee who continue to work through this extraordinary time to support we customer
while we will likely experience a decline in demand in the near term we flexibility and willingness to work closely with we customer and supplier will put we in a very strong position to deliver when the coronavirus be defeat
now more than ever we will continue to stay focus on cash management
we have significant cash on hand to weather the coronavirus but that do not mean we will not feel the impact
we will review all capital expenditure request and will adjust resource base upon significant change in demand
there be a tremendous amount of pressure for we to buy we stock back
while we agree it be severely undervalue we priority be maintain cash to support we growth initiative for long-term shareholder benefit
we be convince we healthcare strategy be solid
Canvys will continue to win new display program and we investment in rf and wireless technology for critical infrastructure expansion will pay off
support these initiative will be a good use of we cash
we position and the position of we Board have not change in this regard
at this point we will be happy to answer a few question
please note we be all in different location so bear with we
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and we do have a question
it come from the line of Marc Silk
Mr. Richardson you have mention cash management the capital expenditure cash a few time
I have see you cash go from $ 60 million a few year ago down to $ 43.9 million
I bring this up before and I think now with what be go_on in the world I think it make sense that I think you salary be excessive
I think the right thing to do even if you cut you salary in half it be still a very healthy salary
and I think you get to do the right thing and show a example that you be sacrifice just like everybody else in the company
so I would like to hear that comment because the last time we talk about this you say you have not pay yourself in a long time but sound to I like the last few year between that and dividend you have be do very well
it be very hard for I to add to my position when you be use this as a piggy bank
so I would like you to comment on that because I think other shareholder feel the same way
so thank you for take my call and good luck
thanks Marc
well we certainly appreciate you opinion
now what we have do during this period of time and we be do it again be the incentive for the executive team have be cut dramatically and that be continue
so even though as a total gross number it look to be quite large to you I understand it be far less than what we have be pay in the_past
so we will take you comment under consideration
and on the buyback you be go to hold off for now correct
because I think have cash be very important
that be correct
we be not go to buy any more stock back at this juncture
you next question come from the line of Harry Sauers
well first off congratulation on a quarterly profit
I be a bit concerned for some time there and that bring I a little bit of hope as a shareholder here as well as you continued commitment to the quarterly dividend
as you discuss with Marc I mean you stock be trade at these ridiculously depressed level but I understand that of course have cash be important
how do you expect that cash be go to be use in light of this situation say if it be to continue on for another year
well I do not think any of we really have a idea of what be go to happen with the coronavirus issue
and at this juncture we want to take sort of a wait and see and be prepare
I think as we do better with the tube the CT Tube manufacturing we under absorption continue to go down and the cost frankly of the tube go down so the margin will go up
and I believe in the near term if we get back to normal that we will go cash_flow neutral and that would be a wonderful situation to have
but at the moment we be go to take a wait-and-see attitude
definitely as a shareholder I agree with you
that would be a wonderful situation to see
I pull up some statistics this_morning that suggest that the average ceo of a electronics manufacture company earn a bit over $ 200,000 in salary
this be from the Bureau of Labor statistics
what make you Mr. Richardson worth nearly 4x that plus performance bonus
well again the amount of salary that I have take and have be pretty much common now since the company have go public year ago
as I mention currently we be take cash incentive reduction so I appreciate you opinion on it
it be be a fact of life with the company and I do not see it change in the_future even
well I do not offer a opinion there
I ask what make you worth it
I guess 50 year experience in the business which do not exist anywhere else in the tube business
interesting
so regard you canvy business segment what do the operating profit or loss look like
Jens do you want to address that
yes
hello this be Jens here
I mean I think we share the number in the during the call right
so we be make a operating contribution and we be grow the business year-over-year since several year now
so I think it be a very positive business development right_now
I be have a bit of trouble here see the synergy of Canvys with you other business line of PMT and healthcare I guess aside from the integration of healthcare display
and to be quite frank with you the canvys.com website it look like it be make in and not update since
do not you think that a larger business with better business synergy and more ability to inject cash into grow Canvys might be a better fit
so I will leave this up to Ed to answer but thanks for make I aware of the website
we be actually work on we website right_now and refresh it and make it nicer and appear more like the healthcare and the rest of the company
so I think many year back before I be hire actually sorry
I say that be a relief
thank you I be glad to hear that
yes
and many year back there be a strategic position at Richardson before I be hire to buy several display company and then merger they together and I think that be pay off
so we be pretty happy with production location in Europe in Germany and also on the East Coast in America and a global supply_chain that work for we
and we have other area where we work closely together with the Richardson Healthcare team
for example we have global certification we have the iso globally we have a quality system that be globally in place for medical device
so we all benefit from that
I think it be a pretty good fit now
anything to you would want to add
yes
I mean we look at that for year when the business be not profitable and frankly we set it up as a very independent company
so if and when it make sense for we to divest of the business then we could do that
and fortunately we be able to attract Jens to come to work for we a number of year ago
and with he knowledge of the medical industry and the display industry and also he hand on ability to manage people and reduce cost he be do a fantastic job
and you listen to what the backlog be now and what the_future look like in that business and I wish all of we business be do as well as the display business that Canvys be do
we certainly intend to have it as a critical part of we future
well I be glad he be do a good job in that regard there
I certainly do not disagree with that right
but especially if we need cash and the need of Canvys customer and employee might be better serve by somewhere with more capital to inject into it I guess you and I be just go to have to agree to disagree on that point
for the time be yes for sure
if you be call certain part of Richardson Healthcare noncore why have you not hire a investment banker to divest those part and refocus on you core operation
we really be not call any portion of Richardson Healthcare noncore
I if you come with away with that impression certainly it be not intend
sure
that be a direct quote from this call
if it be not noncore I can understand that but there be part of it that be refer to as noncore here
okay
I be
Ed maybe I can answer that
all right
Fine
yes
that be I think I make the comment that the sale decline be partially due to noncore part
and what I be refer to there the majority of we business as everyone know be focus on Canon
and in the_past we have a few other vendor and product line in the MRI space in the coil space where we have some part sale but those program be not particularly efficient in term of we investment in inventory dollar
so those be the one when we look at quarter-over-quarter comparison we have some sale in those last_year not a lot as I mention that do not repeat this_year because we have discontinue those effort
but we core business be the Canon part the tube et_cetera that those be perform very well
so I apologize for the confusion
all right
that be very helpful for I then
do you anticipate any inventory write-downs due to demand fall
the I would reserve that only again for this coronavirus issue we have no idea what be go to happen in the next few month
but other than that we do not see any major write-downs
we have normal reserve that be establish and they be more than enough to cover any inventory write-downs at this point
and do those same statement apply to you account receivable
yes
we have do we finance team have do a excellent job in keep the account receivable current and get the collection in on time here
they really do a fantastic job
yes
I definitely see you have very few doubtful account as of now but I do understand that it be be a concern in a lot of business about the account receivable not be able to be collect on
so
well it could happen
again with this coronavirus thing people be go to say Gee we have be close for or 3 month
you can not expect we to pay on time
but so far we have not see that
but who know what be go to happen in that area
we historically that have not be a problem with the business
and what do you attribute the CT Tube sale growth to
because historically the growth have be a little bit up and down
but I believe we be up 130 % against this_quarter over last_year
be that due to the impact of the coronavirus at all
no
wendy do you want to answer that question
yes
so no it be not due to the coronavirus at this point in time
again it be more a factor we have be say since we launch the alta750 that the growth would be linear
and so quarter-over-quarter the trend be just that it be go up
the slope be not as steep as everybody would like it to be
but each quarter we have show with one or two exception we have show growth in the number of tube
in the last quarter 120 day or so we have go out very aggressively make sure that we be position to win every opportunity that we come across
and so that be why I think we be see some of the growth now
do you anticipate any demand slow in those due to the coronavirus
yes
right_now we do
we be see a decline again in the number of call and we we have be talk to the third-party service company that we partner with and they be see a dramatic drop-off in they call volume
and the reason for that be because all nonessential noncritical surgery and procedure have all be postpone
and any equipment maintenance any new install those kind of thing have also be put on hold because the hospital do not want any disruption
they do not let visitor in they facility
so we think that be go to end up be pent-up demand when the coronavirus be under control that we will see the reverse of that
and you will be able
so in the short run how material would that decline be
I do not know
I do not know
I can not really define that at this point
we have no further question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we do have a further question
it come from Eric Landry
so Ed and Wendy I would like to have a short discussion here about the healthcare segment
and Ed you mention earlier in the call that you believe the healthcare strategy be solid and you have make that now and the business as it stand now be I think we would all agree significantly less successful or solid than we have all hope 1.5 year ago
so I be wonder when you and wendy and the Board would consider pivot to more of a strategy that involve some oe manufacturing so that you can fill what to I look like a gorgeous facility with nice modern equipment and lot of know-how inside a factory that appear to be pretty good at build tube yet nobody want tube that nobody want to buy at this point
so if either of you could comment on whether or not there be be any think to pivot the strategy to something that might involve some more volume but perhaps maybe lower margin so you could absorb some of those cost a little bit better than what I be assume be be be absorb right_now
well I will try to answer some of it
and then wendy you be welcome to add you thought
First of all we be well aware for instance on the Canon ALTA750 tube that the tube be sell
it be make by Varex as you know imaging in it
it be sell to Canon for in the realm of $ 30,000 a tube or less
and quite frankly we manufacturing cost today on the tube approach that
so there would be for we to enter the OEM business and try to compete with Varex to sell the tube to Canon would be practically no profit
and so we we total strategy with a company go back as long as I have be with the company be to compete with the oem for the aftermarket business
that be why we get into the CT manufacturing business to compete with varex and Canon for the replacement business at a much higher-margin than be possible in the OEM business
and basically it be a matter of cost and the market condition that we have not go into OEM for that reason
wendy do you want to add you comment on that
sure
so I think we have mention in the_past that we have not completely rule it out
Ed be right it would be very difficult for we to sell to the oem because the pricing be so low
so it be not just a matter of say that we would take lower margin it be whether we could make any margin at all
have say that we have be talk to in the past 12 month we have be talk to different company
and so if the opportunity present itself and it be a good one where we can help develop a new OEM solution where we can make some money do it I think we would consider it Eric and I do not think we be rule it out
in the interim while we do that and the sale team be focus on not just the OEM in the healthcare space but similar tube that be also use in industrial application or security application
so while I can not say anything be imminent it be not that those conversation be not be hold
we absolutely be look at some of those opportunity
now in the interim as we have talk about what we will do which kind of have the same impact be again look at what be the additional tube that serve the end user like Ed say where we can provide tube in the aftermarket and we be work on as you know the G. and we be also start a new project for a different brand and a different different tube type
and as soon as we know more and we be comfortable with the schedule we will start to talk a little bit more about that
but right_now I would not want to put it out there until we can confirm some date
and then finally we be look at other item and accessory that go hand-in-hand with those
as you know we make the heat exchanger in the same facility
we do brush block
we be now look at high voltage multiplier
so there be other thing that they be not huge quantity
it be not the oem business and we fully concede that but there be other part and product that we be look at that can utilize the same resource and as you say the gorgeous facility the new equipment that we have
okay
wendy that be somewhat comforting
but Ed I still do not think I get a answer for why you think or still think that the healthcare strategy be solid so let I just go back
the big reason that we buy the tube
yet when we get to the point where it be time to sell the tube nobody want to buy the tube and there be all kind of reason for that
I guess the OEM be a more stringent competitor than what everybody thought and this that and the other
I be a little bit concerned that there be a lot of hope be pin on the g tube be manufacture and I be fearful that the situation with the g tube may be similar to the situation with the d tube
so we will have two tube to sell but that will just mean that few people want to buy both tube instead of just the one tube
so I would like to know Ed what it be that make you feel more comfort that with this g tube you will all of a sudden have a viable business here whereas at this point it do not appear to be all that viable
well I think first of all none of we think that tube or tube make a business in the CT tube area
and as Wendy mention we be go forward to look at other manufacturer tube as well
and over the next few year you will see we release a number of tube for other manufacturer so that we be not just a tube shop if you will
but at the same time as you well know the former CEO they access on we Board
and I get a kick out of listen to he talk about Varex that it take they 20 year actually to develop the ALTA tube before they could actually get it to market on a reliable basis
and he feel and we have spend a lot of money obviously but he feel we be just right around the corner from have a successful business in the aftermarket space with the some of the new tube we be bring on
and but it be not a 2-year business
and I apologize if we lead you to believe it be a 2-year business go here it be not
it be a 5-year business plus before we can be in a breakeven kind of position
and it be certainly not what the investment world look for in a or 3-year term
okay
it be interesting that you mention a Board member which I be assume be Mr. Kluge and you say that he opinion be that brighter day be right around the corner
it would be helpful if investor could hear that from he because he action sure do not indicate that he see any type of a brighter future right around the corner
and I be refer specifically to stock purchase or in this instance significant lack thereof because he have be very inactive mean purchase of stock that I can see
and it appear that he be a person of somewhat considerable means and could afford to buy the stock
so if investor could hear from he mouth that he believe that this be a very viable business in the not-so-distant future I think that that might override some concern that maybe people have that this be a guy who have be on the Board for 2 year and have not buy one share of stock
so I guess what I would say to wrap it up be that action speak louder than word even give that it would be helpful to hear it from he mouth and then maybe even to have some insider buying on he behalf would also be somewhat helpful
no
I understand
and you have express that opinion before
he will be in for the annual shareholder meeting and we talk about this and he say he would be happy to answer question at that time
so I can not answer the question for he
okay
that would be great
I try to talk to he at the last meeting and he leave early so I do not get a chance
last thing I just want to make clear that both Jens and Greg I guess and wendy everybody be expect material pushout this_quarter because of the virus correct
I think we do not know what to expect
I think that be the answer
okay
and the semiconductor business be that do that appear to be affect as heavily as the other stuff
no
they be also consider a essential business
and as a matter of fact we be on a conference_call with they tomorrow where they be go to give we a update
they be really concern that they have to make delivery on product and want to make sure that we be up to speed and can handle they requirement
so they be put all they major vendor on conference call to tell they what we need to do to fill they requirement and we listen there
in these time they be we biggest customer that be for sure
that industry be we biggest customer
okay
I be sorry to interrupt
we be run out of time so now I would like to turn the call back to Ed for close statement
all right
yes thanks Leslie

it be the most amazing time that we find ourselves in and we fiscal second quarter have be one of the most difficult we have see in a long time give the environment around the world
however we team at SMART have step up to the challenge and deliver strong operational and financial result with both revenue and non-gaap earnings per share above the midpoint of we guidance range in spite of some delay we experience in component availability from China and from some customer operation in China
Ladies and gentleman please stand by you conference_call will resume momentarily
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb-
-lsb- Technical Difficulty -rsb-
Mr. Shah be reconnect now
I be sorry
I apologize for the difficulty that we have
I will start again since I be right close to the beginning
and as I be say we fiscal second quarter have be one of the most difficult we have see in a long time give the environment around the world
however we team at SMART have step up to the challenge and deliver strong operational and financial result with both revenue and non-gaap earnings per share above the midpoint of we guidance range in spite of some delay we experience in component availability from China and from some customer operation in China
the emergence of the covid-19 crisis have clearly create operational challenge and macroeconomic uncertainty
but consider the circumstance we have proactively take the necessary step to first and foremost prioritize the safety and well-being of we global workforce at SMART while at the same time keep the company 's operation function and serve we diverse customer base to ensure they continued success
in the second fiscal quarter we performance also benefit from a good macro environment for memory product and also from stability in brazilian policy and the economy there
furthermore we acquisition from fiscal be show improved performance and increase potential with a robust pipeline of new business in place
finally and importantly the convertible debt refinancing that we complete in early February this year be accretive to earnings and significantly strengthen we balance_sheet and cash position to be able to better weather the challenge ahead and also to take advantage of the opportunity that will be create in this change environment
today we have we team around the world work from home or work in we manufacturing facility provide the essential service and product we customer need from we
while manufacture operation continue in all of we facility around the world so far in some manufacturing location we be operate at reduce level to keep within local guideline and to maintain employee safety
overall we have be able to prioritize requirement with we customer and keep they satisfied
in support of this effort we be undertake step to secure we supply_chain properly reallocate we resource and device contingency plan to aggressively meet the challenge face all of we today
from a supply chain perspective we be function fairly well despite the disruption from covid-19
as the crisis continue we be run numerous contingency scenario to mitigate these challenge as much as possible
in addition we leadership team in all we location around the world be engage with they local community and hospital to support urgent need in the area
turn now to the review of each of we line of business
in the_second_quarter of_fiscal approximately 41 % of revenue come from we Specialty memory Products business 36 % from we Brazil business and 23 % from we Specialty Computing Products business
start now with Specialty memory which represent 41 % of overall revenue and achieve about $ 111 million in revenue in the_quarter
we revenue in this_quarter be 8 % higher than the previous quarter despite some supply shortage and some shutdown by we china-based supplier
during the_quarter we introduce some of the first of a range of specialty ssd product base on we own recently develop firmware and controller technology
also we be see a strong pipeline of new opportunity as we ramp up we sale effort focus on a broader base of customer in new area such as medical industrial defense and security
during the_second_quarter we have one of we strongest performance in term of new design win that result in additional customer and order some of which will start ship as early as the third and fourth quarter of fiscal
for example the increase in iot processing at the edge of the network be drive more demand for storage
and we win a new customer in the area of body camera a market segment where we be not present before
in addition we have a very strong booking quarter for we nvdimm product which offer a low-density alternative to 3d crosspoint technology-based product
move on now to we Brazil business which grow by 4 % over the previous quarter to reach $ 98 million in revenue approximately 36 % of we overall revenue
Brazil outperform we expectation in what be normally a seasonally weak quarter due to calendar year-end shutdown and holiday
we mobile memory product experience higher sell price as we see significant increase in the average density of mobile memory product ship in the period
we have also have some exciting new mobile memory product introduction and product and qualification at we customer
also we dram product in Brazil perform well in the_quarter and pricing hold steady
in Brazil with the new manufacturing rule in place as of July last year and with we customer now clear about the new tax incentive that be sign into law at the end of December last year we be now get longer-term forecast and we be also participate to a greater degree in the higher-density product demand
another new area of progress for we business in Brazil be the introduction of a line of lora-based iot product for smart city application
we have receive the first trial order for some of these product
as you may know LoRa be a long range low power wireless technology that be become a de facto technology for iot network worldwide
while it be difficult to anticipate the effect of covid-19-related effect on the economy and operation in Brazil as well as the significant weakening of the brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar that have happen recently longer term we remain optimistic about the prospects for profitable growth from this part of we business
we Specialty Computing line of business total $ 63 million of revenue in the_quarter represent approximately 23 % of overall revenue
while this be also a seasonally weak period for this line of business revenue in the_quarter be further lower than expect due to delay of certain government-related order
however we have make significant progress in improve gross margin through operational improvement integration and a improve mix of business with a increase share of revenue come from service in this business
you may recall that this business can be lumpy and be dependent on large project particularly those for government agency
the_quarter be also notable in term of we strong booking of multiyear manage service contract which lead to we strongest book quarter ever in this business in term of total contract value
during the_quarter we introduce the first of we solution set for different vertical application utilize GPU or graphic processor and CPU technology integrate with we networking and cluster management software tool for AI hpc and other modeling and analytic application
these solution set offering be now lead we new system booking
we be enter the second half of we fiscal year with a robust pipeline for new business across Specialty Compute and a solid competitive position post the recent industry consolidation which have happen
and this have put we in a put we forward as a strong alternative for many large project
additionally more and more application be emerge drive by AI edge computing and also we be see new application in we wireless computing product where we continue to win new design in partnership with Qualcomm
we remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects across all of we specialty computing area
to further drive we effort in these area we have integrate the management and many engineering service and sale organization across embed Computing and Penguin Computing business
this will help to drive further operate cost improvement as well as a broader set of product offering to the marketplace and a stronger go-to-market effort
in conclusion these be clearly challenging time for all of we to navigate and indeed to forecast
however the long-term underlying business trend point toward a increase need for more datum center cloud and ai-related capability as well as greater requirement for specialize application-specific memory solution all of which leave we confident in we position to meet these demand in the_future
finally in examine we portfolio we line of business have very limited exposure to affect end market such as automotive travel and hospitality and real estate
we do have some exposure to oil and gas and particularly in Brazil to the consumer market
that say we have a significant position in stronger end market such as enterprise and infrastructure computing and communication ai and hpc government and defense application and in enterprise computing in enterprise storage
we be in a strong financial position with over $ 140 million in cash and minimal current debt
we have indeed run many financial simulation and scenario and feel comfortable with we ability to withstand a prolonged downturn
as I say before this should enable we to weather this storm and to be well position for the opportunity that will emerge
with that let I turn the call over to Jack for a review of we financial and we guidance
Jack
thank you Ajay
overall gross revenue for the second fiscal quarter be $ 420.9 million while net sale be $ 272 million
as a reminder the difference between gross revenue and net sale be relate to we supply Chain Services business which be account for on a agency basis mean that we only recognize as net sale the net profit on supply Chain Services transaction
a breakdown of net sale by end market the second fiscal quarter be as follow mobile and pc 34 % network and telecom 24 % server and storage 11 % industrial defense and other 31 %
now move to the rest of the income statement
non-gaap gross profit for the_second_quarter be $ 52.9 million compare with last quarter 's $ 55.7 million primarily due to product mix
non-gaap operating_expense be $ 35.6 million compare with $ 37.5 million in the previous quarter as we have lower audit stock as well as trade show-related expense
non-gaap net income for the_second_quarter be $ 12.8 million or $ 0.52 per diluted share compare with $ 13.4 million or $ 0.55 per diluted share in the previous quarter and adjust ebitda total $ 22.3 million compare with $ 23.5 million in the prior quarter
turn to work capital
we net account receivable total $ 217.4 million compare with $ 228.8 million last quarter
we day sale outstanding decrease to 47 day for this_quarter compare with 50 day last quarter
inventory total $ 161.4 million at the end of the second quarter compare with $ 160 million at the end of the first quarter
inventory turn remain flat at around 9 % for both quarter
consistent with past practice account receivable day outstanding and inventory turnover be calculate on a gross sale and cost of goods sell basis which be $ 420.9 million and $ 369.4 million respectively for the_second_quarter
we enter the_second_quarter with $ 141.9 million of cash and cash equivalent compare with $ 111.4 million at the end of the prior quarter
second quarter cash flow from operation total $ 23.3 million compare with $ 25.3 million in the prior quarter
we exit we second quarter with a very strong balance_sheet as well as a vastly improve capital structure
we issue $ 250 million of convertible note on February 11 , 2020 and use $ 204.9 million of the proceeds to pay off we exist term loan thereby extend we debt maturity out to which mean we do not have any term loan debt payment for 6 year
we also use $ 21.8 million of proceeds to purchase capped call which be expect to reduce dilution to the shareholder upon conversion of the note
the maturity of we $ 50 million revolving line of credit be also extend out 5 year
we do not have any revolver drawdown at the end of q2 nor do we anticipate during the_third_quarter as we expect to continue to generate cash during we third quarter
complete we debt refinancing reduce we cash spend on interest as well as we interest expense book each quarter by over $ 3 million per quarter
and this along with eliminate we cash spend on amortize we debt each quarter which be approximately $ 5.6 million will save we over $ 9 million in cash per quarter begin in we third quarter
for those of you track capex and depreciation capex be $ 4.2 million for the_quarter and depreciation be $ 6 million
and now let I touch on some of the financial and operational dynamics we be currently face
at this time all of we manufacturing facility across the globe be operate and service we customer as Ajay mention earlier
we be still see strong demand from we customer in we third quarter and we guidance reflect this current view of the_quarter
we have analyze and continue to assess we customer and they end market for weakness and strength i.e. oil and gas be expect to be weaker while we networking telecom server and storage business which be some of we largest end market look to be perform stronger due to the increase demand for cloud internet service and telecom
the worldwide crisis due to covid-19 have also further weaken the brazilian real to new level
we be not see this impact consumer spending yet but believe it could have a negative impact on the brazilian economy which have expect positive GDP growth for
we have take a number of step to minimize its impact on the company by have foreign exchange forward contract for account payable which we believe should minimize fx loss from payment
as a reminder we price in U.S. dollar and we convert to the real when we invoice in order to minimize any negative impact to we
we will continue to monitor the situation in Brazil very carefully and work to minimize any result impact to we business
with that as a backdrop let I now turn to we guidance for the_third_quarter of_fiscal
we currently estimate that we third quarter net sale will be in the range of $ 270 million to $ 300 million
the midpoint of which represent a increase of 5 % sequentially
Gross margin for the_quarter be estimate to be approximately 20_% to 22 %
gaap earnings per diluted share be expect to be approximately $ 0.33 per share plus or minus $ 0.05
on a non-gaap basis exclude share-based compensation expense and intangible asset amortization expense we expect non-gaap earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $ 0.68 plus or minus $ 0.05 the midpoint of which represent a increase of 31 % sequentially
the guidance for the third fiscal quarter do not include any view on the foreign exchange gain or loss or a mark-to-market adjustment for we capped call and include a income tax provision expect to be in the range of 14 % to 18 %
the number of share use to estimate earnings per diluted share for the third fiscal quarter be 24.6 million
Capital expenditure for the third fiscal quarter be expect to be in the range of $ 4 million to $ 6 million
please refer to the non-gaap financial information section and the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measure to gaap result and reconciliation of gaap net income to adjust EBITDA table in we earnings press release for further detail
operator we be now ready to take question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays
obviously the backdrop here I think most company be lower number you have some good result
I be curious kind of a couple of thing on that front
one if you can just talk about where you see shortage if there be any quantification on kind of how much that impact be
and then I be kind of just curious as you be look forward here you kind of have opposing factor
seem like you probably would benefit from some work from home which could be a near-term boost
but then obviously you have a big consumer business in Brazil
and I be no expert on COVID exposure in Brazil but I think most people assume that be go to get worse
so I be just kind of curious how you be handicap that
as you know Blayne Jack and I be in different place
so we will try to give you a coordinate response
I will start and Jack can fill in
to come back to you question about let I start at the end with respect to Brazil
so Brazil have by the way many of the same restriction in place today as we do in most of the United_States
so in other word we have stay-at-home restriction as well as retail and travel be significantly limit
and so effectively what you have be most of we staff be work from home except for manufacturing which be not possible to do from home
we be see some of we customer have slowdown and shutdown for temporary maybe because they have a case of positive of COVID
and so it be a uneven environment and less predictable
but as you point out some of the benefit we be see be from the particularly the pc and the server market pc laptop server not as much in the mobile phone market
the mobile phone market at least for now we can see production level be down and that be to some degree drive by component shortage
but now I think we be go to see a different effect which be factory be also slow down because of shutdown and some temporary situation at certain customer not all customer
so it be a fluid situation
but we have be obviously look at we backlog and what we have ship already
and as a result we be pretty comfortable with where we be in term of we q3 estimate
and obviously we have backlog by this stage for much of what we be talk about
bar some significant incident which cause we to shut_down operation or something like that we be pretty confident in we estimate
now to come back to the beginning of you question which be shortage from China which be a little earlier in the_quarter we have shortage and they ripple through all the way to the supply_chain
mostly what we buy in China be we circuit board and passive
but Jack you might care to elaborate further on that
sure
real quick Blayne to also some of we customer have a component shortage if you be go that way with the question
seem like even in Brazil when Ajay mention that we do not ship some mobile memory because of component shortage it be we customer who could not get part not we
so the phone guy could not get enough part to build phone so they shut_down for a little bit during the_quarter
as far as we we do not really have a issue of get we part but we have customer who could not get some of they part out of China
and then we have the chinese contract manufacturer shut_down for 5 week or so in the_quarter
so yes there be a minimal impact to we in the_quarter but it be not anything dramatic in we q2
and just one last one if you could just the gross margin improvement into May what be drive that
sure
I mean a lot of it be that Specialty Compute which be the highest gross margin segment of the business be go to project to have a better quarter in q3
remember in q2 we talk about the government that have get push
so that get push into q3
and so the performance there will improve the margin somewhat in the_quarter
we next question come from raji Gill with Needham & Company
a question on the memory market
my understanding be that the lead time have kind of stretch out for memory and both for DRAM and NAND and we be start to see increase pricing in Flash and DRAM
wondering if you could kind of comment on you thought on that dynamic that you be see in the market and how that be kind of bleed into you business
sure
I could start and maybe Ajay can come in and finish a little bit
yes we be see we be definitely see DRAM lead time stretch out
we have see those get out to 15 week
we be see Flash still longer especially in cap and resistor
so we be kind of back to a situation now where customer be place order earlier to get they part which be helpful to we
and Ajay mention earlier we have a backlog for most of we business during the_quarter
and so we be get more backlog again from customer as they have to order farther out to make sure that they get they part
so far it be not hurt we from a revenue or margin standpoint
it give a little bit better visibility
okay
get it
and you talk about some of the end market oil and gas be weaker offset by network storage telecom
you kind of lump pc and mobile together at like 34 %
it seem to I that there could be some issue in mobile give the production problem
wondering if you could kind of break out the and storage
I be just try to see what the to pinpoint the exposure
sure
so most of the mobile and pc all pretty much all of that be in Brazil
the only place we really play in the consumer market be in Brazil
so that be really all Brazil exposure
so it be not a worldwide kind of phenomenon there
and so there you be probably still look at of that be probably mobile of that would be pc
okay
and in term of just the weaken the real
so you talk about put FX contract to try to minimize you ap payment
but you have not see the impact yet on actual end demand
so I be just wonder what would when would you see that
and would it be just obviously in just lower sell through for these phone
yes
I mean we should see it in we we should see it from we customer right
we would start get lower forecast from the cell phone guy in Brazil say the Lenovo and LG that they 6 month forecast for we will start to decrease if they sell-through be go down
and so far we have not see that yet in Brazil
as you might imagine raji this be a point that we be particularly focus on because we can see the effect of a 20_% change in the exchange rate on the end price of the product
and to top it all off you have significant slowdown in retail right
and there be quite a few phone sell through retail
so meanwhile online be even in Brazil grow much faster
and so if we sound like we be not able to give you a extremely clear answer it be because we be not in that we the forecast we be get as recently as this week be continue to show pretty not show any significant drop-off
I mean there be change but not significant
what we be see be the effect of factory shut_down for a week 2 week because of issue with infection
we next question come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank
a couple of they I for the Specialty Computing business I wonder if you can double-click on that and give we some color what portion of that business you consider as stable and what be more like gdp-driven that may get impact in the macro environment we be in particularly interested in you view on some of the government project
and kind of related to that Ajay you talk about increase you be see a increase potential from the acquisition
maybe can you get into a little more color what those potential could be
sure Sidney thank you
I will start and maybe Jack can add to it
the start with the sector we have a fair amount of business as you note with government and government lab and different government agency
and we do not see any drop-off in activity there
if anything the spending have increase as you have note in the press I be sure
we do have a fair amount of business with financial service with mostly from a analytic point of view with medical particularly analytic and trial and that business seem all right
we have a fair amount of business with social media and that business seem pretty well all right
we have some business in that entire segment related to telecom
and so far that be good
we have some business related to industrial and frankly it be a small segment but we could see a little bit of push out in the industrial segment
and as you as I think I note in my comment we have some business related to oil and gas
and that oil and gas business frankly it be kind of I be speculate when I say we expect it to get weaker because we have not see it get weaker yet
but maybe that be because they be all work from home and have not yet get to the point where they have decide to relook at they capex
so I be speculate
I do not really know
I be guess that one would expect the oil and gas-related large installation to be weaker go forward
much as we business today it do not seem to be show that
and finally we have in we wireless computing area some consumer-related exposure which be actually do extremely strongly
and then we have some enterprise related which we be not quite sure how it be go to pan out
but when we combine all that and take into account the seasonality of that business at least in we third quarter and from what we can see go forward we have a pretty strong position and not a lot of weak one
Great
and in term of you talk about this increase potential that you be see from the acquisition
can you give we a little more color on those
well those be what we be talk about in Specialty Compute
all of we acquisition have be in that line of business the Specialty Computing and Storage line of business
so that be what I be talk about
and one area which we acquire Penguin Computing high-performance computing that be do pretty well
another area be embed Computing and there we have a fair amount of government related business and defense-related business and that be do pretty well
and then we have wireless computing which be do really well because that be grow very significantly with both exist customer that be grow and new customer
so hopefully that be in line with you question
yes
Great
maybe a follow-up question
I appreciate the gross margin color you guy provide in the quarterly filings
as we look forward how do you think about the gross margin for the Specialty Computing business
I think it have improve like at least point from a year ago
be that something you can think about a 3-handle
and then which of the business do you expect to see the most upside potential from where they be today
sure I can jump into that one
I mean the reason you have see the big increase of Artesyn right when we buy Artesyn we say that be like a 40 % gross margin-type business
so the purchase of Artesyn have really bump up the gross margin as to why you see that Specialty higher now
I think go forward as we have be talk about we think we can continue to improve the Penguin margin
so I think go forward the biggest improvement in this area will be the Penguin margin especially as we get more and more manage service in that business
I mean Ajay talk about this quarter be we best quarter for booking and a lot of that be in kind of some of the manage service area we continue to improve that business
and if we manage service business grow we will continue to see the gross margin in those business grow
Great
if I can squeeze in one more question
go ahead
go ahead Jack
sure
no no
and you might see a 3-handle sometime for that business in the_future certainly
Great
one last question for I
be you in the guidance be you expect any onetime charge whether that be in cost of goods sell or operating expense relate to logistics-related cost
Ajay you mention component availability from China operational challenge in China
anything specific that be a onetime thing that may come off in the following quarter
no
well maybe again not know exactly what you be refer to
so the convertible debt we have a significant number of onetime expense relate to that offering and to related to the extinguishing of we term debt
so you see that already in we financial statement if that be what you mean
the other question
yes I be think more on the operational side
yes
on the operational and it be a question as to whether you would call it operational
I mean the depreciation of the real the brazilian real may it be be a very rapid depreciation
exactly how that be go to play through we be still try to figure out
obviously it reduce we local cost labor and facility and so on
but meanwhile it mean that price in local currency be higher
how that be all go to play through
we do not know
but no we be not anticipate any very specific onetime cost relate to operation if that be you question
we next question come from Brian Chin with Stifel
and maybe the first question just to level set go back to just you outlook for the May quarter 5 % sequential growth at the midpoint
can you maybe walk we through you thinking in term of how Brazil be go to do there relative to the guide Specialty memory as well as Specialty Compute
sure
I can kind of take it to a high level
at a high level we would expect we Brazil business to be maybe fairly flat kind of quarter-over-quarter
we would expect both Specialty Compute and Specialty memory to grow in q3
and Specialty Compute will probably a little bit faster than Specialty memory in the q3 quarter
get it
okay
that be helpful
and then maybe a couple of follow-up
first in term of Specialty memory obviously strong solid growth there in the February quarter growth again for the May quarter
yes
I know that a lot of you production I believe be sort of Malaysia Southeast Asia and probably you neck of the wood in Newark
but when those shelter-in-place measure start to become more acute sort of mid March if you will early in the quarter I be curious it sound like you have not really see a impact on you business from a production side
I be curious if you customer what be sort of they reaction when that happen
be it kind of maybe to buffer up more product
do you see a change in term of they behavior
I mean I think in the Specialty memory section the customer be just one want to make sure that we be go to operate to support they right because a lot of we customer that we have in Specialty memory be in the critical infrastructure some in the medical and in the defense area
and so they be all critical potential business as well they need to operate
so it be more come to we to make sure we be go to operate which we be and then just want to make sure that we could meet they schedule that they have
and most of the product right_now as we have talk earlier the lead time have lengthen out considerably
and so they want to make sure that we be still go to be able to ship what we have commit to for the_quarter
it be mainly not mainly be make sure that we can ship what we be go to we have already commit to in the_quarter during this time
get it
okay
then maybe
be that a helpful
yes that be helpful Jack
yes walk over to Brazil then
again it sound like maybe you can help out
one be there base on customer like you say the kind of funnel impact here of shut_down production relative to sort of the virus outbreak
be you see any impact in you fiscal 3q in term of that
you say Brazil have kind of flattish revenue but be you see any impact there in that flash
and then secondly on the demand side of that to what extent have you see the weaker real sort of customer actually adjust they product pricing you customer in term of they sell to the consumer out there
have that adjustment be make
and be that maybe part of the lag here
and kind of from a timing perspective if you do see sort of the rolling forecast revision maybe trend down do you have a sense on timing
be that sort of like a mid-year or calendar year event
or any sort of color you could provide there would be helpful
sure
I will take part of that maybe Ajay can answer a part too
I mean as far as the customer forecast so we have customer forecast pretty much every week every 2 week from the customer
and they be kind of constantly look out at the_future and adjust they
so we do not wait like 6 month to get a whole new forecast of pop and thing change
and so they have be slowly adjust they forecast
but as Ajay mention earlier we have not see any major change from we customer in Brazil yet on they forecast due to demand
they demand seem pretty good
we have have some up and downs as Ajay mention because somebody might have shut a factory down for a week or another back up and run so there be be little blip like that but nothing from a long-term forecast
and as I mention we really have not see the impact of the real weaken they demand yet
and I think they have be put through price increase on they product
they be not eat the weakness in the real
and base on we forecast consumer must still be buy they at this at the higher price
the interesting fact in Brazil be that a lot of people finance product even phone in Brazil
even though the real have weaken a little bit the bank for lending rate the government lending rate be really low right_now
so you have lower interest rate you have have in a long time
so that might be impact it might be go the other way from a weaker real they could finance it cheaper
so maybe they overall spend have not be change that much
I do not know
yes
I mean to be honest with you I we totally get you question
and we have be ask exactly the same question of we team in Brazil and try to check in with customer as well because we can see what be happen
and if price go up by 20_% and would not we expect that to affect demand
and so we can not assure you that it be not go to
we really I wish I could
but what we can tell you be that we have be check on that
and so far we customer be not tell we
in fact we be ask kind of aggressively be you sure you forecast be real
because what we do not want be a repeat of a inventory buildup follow by cliff
and they assure we that they have recalculate they forecast base on the demand that they be see now
and base on that these be they forecast
so we be bless with only so much visibility into this and that be what we have so far
maybe just to wedge one more thing in relative to so the unit could the forecast still be maintain
we will kind of see what headwind evolve there
but in term of the content I think you do allude in the prepared remark you be see some content improvement maybe in term of like mcp or whatnot
maybe if you can kind of comment on maybe what you might be see in term of content pickup
we have mention before that in Brazil there be a system that go into place in July last year that have local content measure in point and we mention at the time that if you think about it from we customer point of view they have a significant benefit in certain commodity from the point because they can now pick and choose which commodity they want to emphasize in they purchase of local locally produce product
and it turn out memory provide some of the best advantage
so what you be see really be a flow-through of exactly that which be that for we customer memory provide some of the best way by which they can meet they local content requirement
and as I be also say as of the end of December literally the very end of December there be a new law in place which go into effect April 1
so it be a law that be effective roughly a week back
and this law very clearly spell out how tax benefit will work go forward for all these company include for ourselves
and so as a result customer be comfortable that they know how to operate in this environment
for a year now for maybe 6 to 9 month I should say there be a fair amount of uncertainty but now I think that that be clear up
and that be help customer to be very clear about they strategy and therefore they give we a longer-term view of they business
and also it be help they in that both the average density be go up
I mean that be just happen across the world
Products be consume more memory I mean I be talk about smartphone
and they be give we a greater share of the higher density product mix
so that be what we be see
and I think it have a lot to do with the fact that there be less I do not know confusion or uncertainty about what the regulation be
we next question come from Suji Desilva with Roth Capital
a lot of conversation about Brazil but I be not sure if you cover it
can you talk about why Brazil in the_quarter you report be outperform seasonality
be there pull-in potentially
no
mostly it be higher-density product in the mobile area
and in DRAM pc have be fairly strong
but clearly higher-density product unit be a little lower compare to the previous quarter as expect because you have a 2-week shutdown at Christmas and then a slowdown related to Carnival that come in a little later
but in spite of that we have a good quarter above we plan particularly because of mobile product entity
yes
I mean asp be up about 60 % in the mobile area from q1 to q2
so they be turn back up as the density of the product be grow again
get it
okay
then my other question be on the SSD part of the business
be there a percent of revenue or material part of the revenue you would call out that ssd be expect to provide in the next 4 to 8 quarter to get a sense of how big you think that business could be
when you say ssd be you talk about Specialty Flash
be you talk in Brazil I guess
no no no
Specialty Flash
I mean we have talk about that the growth engine of Specialty memory as a whole so I mean that continue to grow
but we do not have a firm number to this be go to be half the business of the business
we keep get win
and but we have add a lot of big win in the Specialty in the dram business
this be a great quarter for DRAM as well
so even though the Specialty Flash SSD business be grow with a new controller we be get new design win we have a very good quarter in NVDIMM design win as Ajay mention and just memory design win
so the whole business as a whole have a very good quarter and be ramp up and continue to grow as you see in we number
and we last question come from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies
I be on but my line drop and so I apologize if the question be ask
the so I guess some investor that I speak with be concern that as the virus move around the world that be go to impact different supply_chain
and I think most people believe that China have be come back but some other place be start to get hit and have be shut_down
I be wonder if there be like a if you could just review briefly like how you supply_chain what geography you be most expose to
sure
do you want I to start that off Jack
sure if you want to
yes Mark the we have essentially major manufacturing location and then we have a number of other smaller one
the major one be in Malaysia
we main asian center be in Malaysia
and then of course we have the brazilian one which we have talk about quite often
and finally we have in the Bay Area 2 manufacture facility one primarily focus on the high-performance computing the large system and the other one a mixture of component and board and system
and Malaysia be relatively unscathed in the early part of this crisis since say January when China be go through a particularly difficult level of shutdown January and then part of February
that have clearly improve mean China have improve
now Malaysia meanwhile have a number of case and the government get quite restrictive in term of any gathering of people include for work or manufacturing
however this have now be a very specific discussion with the malaysian government by what be call the American Chamber of mostly technology company
and there as a result a agreement that be in detail and it detail what we can do in term of number of staff and so on and detail what we can not do
and we get check on that
so we think that in a way it be a good thing because we be clearly regulate if you will
and we be operate under those regulation at less than full strength
that be already true today
now this be a changing world and I can not assure you that that will be the case 2 week from now
but I think that the government have show that if we take reasonable measure and make sure and we be really really focus on the safety of we staff first and foremost
we will not take a risk that put they at in harm 's way
so in Malaysia I think we be okay
in Brazil we operate a factory which be really a clean room lot of very heavy air flow and we have put in place a whole lot of procedure to make sure that social distance work
and so far we have not have any issue
and finally in we operate in Alameda County and we have have discussion with the Alameda County health authority and show they exactly what we be do
and they have be satisfy with it and have continue to let we operate as a essential business
maybe a long answer to you question
I be not sure if that be what you want
no it be actually what I be hope to get
yes sorry Jack go ahead
no problem
that be good
so I have a follow-up if I may
we have be do a lot of check in the supply_chain
and I think the thing I have be most surprised about if not shock about be how little that we be hear about material order cut
in fact sometimes the opposite
and it be in the_quarter you just report and the outlook be a personification of that
and it seem that you might share that kind of perspective of surprise
and I guess my question be to what extent do you think this be come from that we just finish a inventory the fact that you guy be in the good end market or versus be this something that be just go to come
I know that be a impossible answer to have or a question to have a answer to but I be hope you might share you view on that
be it possible Mark for I to ask you that question
I be in
I can send you my report on this
we have be listen to you webcast too Mark try to get information from you
yes
it be a very uncertain time
but we think there be element of all of what you say
meaning first and foremost the sector we serve be the sector that be actually do almost to a degree be push forward by this crisis like for example the communication area both telecommunications and enterprise communication
the other area that we serve also seem pretty strong
so that maybe be one issue
the other might be a inventory issue and it could be in form
it could be what you sort of suggest which be a previous inventory lean-out that be now be fill back up or it could be a little bit of overbuy to make sure that they be not short
and we try very hard to keep a eye on that but I can not tell you we have perfect visibility into that
so at least those thing be strong in we favor
and that will conclude today 's question-and-answer session
I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Shah for close remark
thank you operator
well we look forward to report on we progress in the coming month it be go to be interesting
thank you all again for join we today
Goodbye

I would like to remind everyone that this call be be record and will be make available for replay via a link available in the Investor Relations section of SeaChange 's website
now I would like to turn the call over to SeaChange 's CEO Mr. Yossi Aloni
thanks operator and good afternoon everyone
we be pleased to announce that the transformation of 9 month we upgrade we Board of director have a new executive team new sale and marketing organization and a stronger and more efficient r&d organization
in we launch the final go to-market strategy integrate on the excellent SeaChange stand-alone product into a single-winning software solution with value-based engagement
the initial result be just great
during the last 9 month of_fiscal we win more project than SeaChange win over the past 7 year
these win enable we to deliver profit and growth albeit a cliff in we legacy revenue
overall fiscal be a positive year for SeaChange
we achieve a total revenue of $ 67.2 million of this amount framework engagement of 55 % of we total revenue
we improve we total gross margin to 65 %
in the second half of fiscal where most of we revenue come from framework engagement we gross margin be over 70 %
we generate $ 4.8 million in non-gaap operating income
we realize more than $ 12 million in annualize cost savings and this be just the beginning
we consolidate we r&d operation to a single location increase we efficiency and enable additional meaningful savings for fiscal
we clean up all we legacy customer commitment many of which generate negative roi
this enable additional savings for fiscal
as we exit q4 SeaChange be a profitable grow lean and efficient company and well position to benefit from the covid-19 impact on the media segment
as for the current operating environment with covid-19 road map and customer support no impact
we CTO take all the need action in a timely manner
we maintain both we high-quality customer support and road map development pace
customer engagement we and we customer be work from home therefore this be slow some of we engagement
we continue to push forward and we expect to continue and close business
as for the opportunity with the framework be the only solution that can reduce we customer video quality operating expense by up to 50_% we expect to see a significant boost to we business within very few month
tv provider be face challenge these day a increase in operating_expense and decline revenue
grow demand for video increase the provider expense
for example many tv provider be pay more for CDN other be increase network support and make immediate network investment to enable service the grow demand
in addition while the tv provider operating_expense be increase advertise revenue and video arpu be go down
the increase operating_expense with decline revenue as we enter a recession be a perfect storm for the tv provider
we framework be the best tool in the industry to address these challenge
on the cost side use we value-based engagement we will reduce we customer operating_expense to a point where the total cost of ownership to use the framework be almost
we try to make it impossible for the customer to say no while protect we target margin
in many case we customer reduce the video delivery operating expense by 50_%
on the revenue side the Framework enable the tv provider to offer web-like advertising for both live and on-demand tv which enable they to protect and increase some of they advertising revenue
no other vendor in the industry offer a cost to own solution or make this claim
this amazing combination will enable we to scale up we business
we believe that within very few month fiscal will be a great year for SeaChange
before I discuss we outlook and strategic initiative for fiscal I will turn the call over to we CCO Chad to provide detail on the Framework win
afterwards Michael we CFO will walk you through we financial performance
Chad
thanks Yossi and good afternoon everyone
it be great to speak with you again today
we finish the fiscal year with a exceptionally strong win rate by secure significant framework deal in q4 which be up approximately 30 % over the prior quarter
the framework win in the_quarter bring the mention we achieve this all in less than a year a truly impressive feat on its own
the win we secure reflect the increase demand we be see across the industry for we versatile cloud-based or localized video delivery solution
framework enable content owner service provider and broadcaster to offer a netflix-like service for both live channel and video-on-demand use exist cable network and/or over-the-top
this help these organization stay competitive and generate new revenue stream by offer unique service and content to meet all they customer view need
it be not just a sheer number of win that be noteworthy it be also the healthy mix of new and exist logo we secure during the_year include significant win in which we successfully replace a compete legacy solution
from the top telecommunication company in the U.S. to lead regional service provider globally the common denominator be that these organization be select the framework to enhance the user experience significantly reduce operate cost and more effectively monetize they install base
a integral part of we success be thanks to the go-to-market strategy we implement last April
if you have the opportunity to hear yossi or I talk about the strategy in any detail you will know that it be inspire by simplicity
we start by introduce the framework where we have truly the best component
this include the best user interface and the best back office and instead of be sell as stand-alone component which be how the company previously sell we begin sell it as a fully integrate solution
customer be look for a plug-and-play solution that just work not multiple component that they have to assemble to build a solution
while we have have great success selling framework follow this proven strategy we be not rest on we laurel and be actively pursue additional approach and channel to drive greater adoption and revenue stream for SeaChange
later this year we plan to introduce the Framework plug-in store which will be design to help we customer do more with the framework through both free and premium plug-in provide they with further avenue to monetize they install base
additionally the Framework technology enable we to change the way tv ad be sell which in turn will allow we customer to recoup some of the ad revenue the tv industry have lose to the web over the past decade
in fact we have several ongoing customer engagement and should be able to announce the initial customer deployment in the coming month
overall we be really encourage by the sale traction we achieve in fiscal
we have enter the new year with a grow list of framework customer build recur revenue through multiyear agreement industry-leading technology along with a robust pipeline of new opportunity that be well distribute across we geographic region
we be confident these factor have position we well for continued success in fiscal and beyond
with that I will turn the call over to Mike to walk we through we financial performance for fiscal q4 and the full year of 2020
Mike
thanks Chad and good afternoon everyone
turn to we financial result for the_fourth_quarter end January 31 , 2020
we enter the_fourth_quarter of_fiscal with $ 22.2 million in total backlog exclude maintenance and legacy support
we book new business of $ 17.4 million during the_fourth_quarter and end the_quarter with backlog of $ 21.8 million
total revenue increase 14 % to $ 19.3 million from $ 17 million in the same year ago period
the increase in total revenue be drive by a $ 13 million increase in framework revenue compare to no framework revenue in the same year ago period offset by a $ 10.7 million decrease in legacy revenue
product revenue increase 69 % to $ 13.2 million or 69 % of total revenue from $ 7.8 million or 46 % of revenue in the same year ago period
the increase in product revenue be drive by a $ 12.4 million increase in framework revenue
Service revenue decrease 33 % to $ 6.1 million or 31 % of total revenue from $ 9.1 million or 54 % of total revenue in the same year ago period
the decrease in service revenue be due to lower revenue from both professional service and support revenue from customer relate to we legacy product
as we mention in we q3 call these decline be consistent with we expectation as we transition legacy customer to new Framework arrangement and transition we professional service organization to we customer engineering organization as we complete legacy professional service project
revenue from we international market be $ 11 million or 57 % of total revenue which compare to $ 12.4 million or 73 % of total revenue in the same year ago period
the decrease in international revenue be due to a large project for a significant international customer in the fourth quarter of last year
revenue in we U.S. market be $ 8.2 million or 43 % of total revenue which be up from $ 4.6 million or 27 % of total revenue in the same year ago period
the increase in revenue from the U.S. be due to we framework offering be introduce in fiscal
in term of customer concentration we have customer that account for 16 % and 12 % of we total revenue compare to customer in q4 of last_year that account for 42 % of we total revenue
look at we margin
Gross profit increase $ 14 million or 73 % of total revenue from $ 10.9 million or 64 % of total revenue in the same year ago period
the increase in gross profit be due to a shift in sale to we framework product start in q2 of fiscal
73 % gross margin we achieve in the_quarter exceed we annual guidance target of 60 % for the fiscal year
product gross margin be 87 % compare to 88 % in q4 of last_year
Service gross margin be 42 % compare to 43 % in q4 of last_year
look at we expense non-gaap operating_expense decrease 25 % to $ 9.2 million from $ 12.3 million in q4 of last_year
the improvement reflect the continued cost savings initiative relate to the reduction of third-party cost and elimination of nonessential internal cost throughout the organization
in q4 we eliminate all resource relate to legacy professional service and support arrangement as we complete the remain legacy project we have underway
we success reduce opex enable we to realize consecutive quarter of non-gaap operating income as well as consecutive quarter of non gaap net income
gaap income from operation total $ 3.6 million a improvement from a loss of $ 19.9 million in the same year ago period
as a percent of total revenue gaap income from operation for the_fourth_quarter of_fiscal be 19 % which compare to a negative percentage in the year ago period
non-gaap income from operation total $ 4.8 million or $ 0.13 per diluted share a improvement from a loss of $ 1.2 million or $ 0.03 per basic share in the same year ago period
as a percentage of total revenue non-gaap income from operation be 25 % compare to negative 7 % in q4 of last_year
gaap net loss total $ 43,000 or $ 0.00 per basic share a significant improvement from a loss of $ 19.6 million or $ 0.55 per basic share in the same year ago period
non-gaap net income total $ 1.2 million or $ 0.03 per diluted share
this be a improvement from a loss of $ 946,000 or $ 0.03 per basic share in q4 of last_year
as a percentage of total revenue non-gaap net income be 6 % compare to negative 6 % in q4 of last_year
turn to the balance_sheet we end the_year with $ 13.9 million in cash and cash equivalent and marketable security and have no debt
we cash position be up $ 159,000 from prior quarter so we be please with that progress for the_quarter as in prior quarter and prior year we have have significant cash burn
deferred revenue at quarter end be $ 6.2 million which compare to $ 7.8 million at the end of the prior quarter and $ 10.7 million at the end of q4 last_year
the sequential and year-over-year decrease be primarily due to the decrease in legacy revenue and the timing of revenue recognize and renewal of post - warranty maintenance and support agreement during the_quarter
DSO exclude unbilled receivables be 66 day at the end of the fourth quarter of this fiscal year which compare to $ 16.7 million in the prior quarter and $ 5.4 million in q4 of last_year
the sequential and year-over-year increase be the result of the timing of billing from we framework deal due to the payment term on those deal compare to the revenue recognition for the framework deal
now turn to we fiscal year result
total revenue increase 8 % to $ 67.2 million from $ 62.4 million in fiscal
the increase in total revenue be drive by a $ 36.8 million increase in framework revenue compare to no framework revenue in fiscal offset by a 51 % decrease in legacy revenue to $ 30.4 million compare to $ 62.4 million in fiscal
we fall slightly short of the lower end of we guidance range primarily because of a few framework deal that push out of the_quarter
look at we revenue bucket product revenue increase 93 % to $ 39.9 million or 59 % of total revenue from $ 20.7 million or 33 % of total revenue in fiscal
the increase in product revenue be drive by a $ 18.3 million increase in framework revenue
Service revenue decrease 35 % to $ 27.2 million or 41 % of total revenue from $ 41.7 million or 67 % of total revenue in fiscal
the decrease in service revenue be drive by a $ 6.1 million decrease in installation and customize development service as a result of we framework product 's out-of-the-box functionality as well as a $ 7 million decrease in maintenance associate with decommission legacy product
revenue from we international market be $ 35.4 million or 53 % of total revenue which compare to $ 38.8 million or 62 % of total revenue in fiscal
revenue in we U.S. market be $ 31.7 million or 47 % of total revenue which be up from $ 23.6 million or 38 % of total revenue in fiscal
in term of customer concentration we have no customer account for more than 10_% each of we total revenue in the fiscal year compare to customer who represent 24 % and 11 % each in fiscal
look at we margin gross profit increase to $ 43.5 million or 65 % of total revenue from $ 37.3 million or 60 % of total revenue in fiscal
as I mention earlier the increase in gross profit be due to a new go-to-market strategy of we framework product start in q2 of fiscal
the 65 % gross margin we achieve exceed we annual guidance target of 60 % for the fiscal year
product gross margin be 85 % compare to 83 % in fiscal
the improvement be due to a increase in higher-margin framework revenue in fiscal
Service gross margin be 36 % compare to 48 % in fiscal
the decline be due to fix cost related to decommission of we legacy product in fiscal
look at we expense non-gaap operating_expense decrease 20_% or $ 9.8 million to $ 40 million from $ 49.7 million in fiscal
as I mention earlier the improvement reflect the continued cost savings initiative relate to the reduction of third-party cost and elimination of nonessential internal cost throughout the organization
turn to we profitability measure gaap loss from operation total $ 3.5 million a significant improvement from a loss of $ 35.8 million in fiscal
non-gaap income from operation total $ 3.6 million or $ 0.10 per diluted share a improvement from a loss of $ 11.7 million or $ 0.33 per basic share in fiscal
as a percentage of total revenue non-gaap income from operation be 5 % which compare to a negative percentage in fiscal
gaap net loss for the_year total $ 8.9 million or $ 0.24 per basic share a significant improvement from a loss of $ 38 million or $ 1.06 per basic share in fiscal
include in the net loss for fiscal be a onetime noncash charge of $ 5.4 million related to the loss on the sale of we prior headquarters in Acton
and finally non-gaap net loss improve by $ 12 million to a loss of $ 1.9 million or $ 0.05 per basic share from a loss of $ 13.9 million or $ 0.39 per basic share in fiscal
before I hand the call over to Yossi I want to discuss guidance for we fiscal
prior to the onset of covid-19 we be prepare to provide guidance represent meaningful revenue growth in fiscal
base on we pipeline we believe revenue guidance of $ 80 million to $ 90 million for fiscal with operate metric consistent with we previous guidance be achievable
we be work to better understand the impact of covid-19 and will provide we formal fiscal guidance as COVID 's impact on we business become clearer
this complete my financial summary
for a more detailed analysis of we financial result please refer to today 's earnings release as well as we 10-k which we plan to file by April 15
yossus
thanks Mike
we start fiscal with positive momentum and the best pipeline we have ever have
as Mike mention prior to covid-19 we plan to guide for $ 80 million to $ 90 million for fiscal
we expect to better understand the short-term covid-19 impact during the next 90 day
we believe that we have the right cost structure to endure the next few month and later to prevail use we value base engagement and unique value proposition
there be one final item I would like to mention
recently we have a new module to the Framework which will change the way the tv industry unsold and underutilize advertising inventory be monetize
we be currently work with several customer and will share more in the near future
with that let I turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A
operator
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from Steven Frankel with Dougherty
so Yossi you talk about several deal that you hope to close in q4 that slip out
I wonder if you might tell we approximately how many deal slip out of the_quarter
what be they value
and have any of those deal close thus far in q1
thanks Steve
so these be deal from the international market
we do not lose any of they
we expect to close all of they
closing the deal would have enable we to significantly exceed we revenue target
unfortunately we be not able to complete the agreement in a timely manner
it be also important to note if you do not mind that we win ratio include these deal that we consider not out of the win ratio we win ratio for last_year be quite decent
it be over 75 % out of which deal be push out
we do not lose they and we be also start with a positive momentum
so overall we be still very bullish on the_future of we company
okay
and let 's talk about solve the cash problem
yes you do generate some cash in q4 but it be a relatively minor amount
I assume you internal plan be for something higher than that
what kind of cash burn might we expect in the next couple of quarter until business pick up
yes it be Mike
I can take that
so during the first 3 quarter of the year we do burn $ 17 million
we have kind of a call it cash neutral or we generate a little bit of cash in q4
grant it be a small increase but I think it be significant in comparison to the cash burn in prior quarter and prior year
be a transition year for we
so we be focus on optimize we cost structure build a business that be consistently generate cash
and then I think just in term of stability we have get a account receivable and a unbilled base
and if we ever at some point in the_future decide we want to put something in place I think that would be kind of a logical next step
but you will burn material cash in the next couple of quarter right
that be just you business cycle that be be the company 's history
or be there something different that say if business recover in q2 you would generate cash
so Mike before you answer that Steve there be one more item that you need to look at
you will see the update opex
the challenge we have last_year we have some negative commitment very meaningful in term of opex
the impact of these legacy commitment be both on the support organization and the r&d organization
now that all of these legacy commitment be do and complete with negative roi obviously in q1 we cost structure be much better therefore it will have a significant impact on the cash that we need
but Mike please go ahead
no I think that make sense
I think the only thing I will just add be yes we may see a little bit of a cash burn especially maybe quarter-to-quarter
we will give maybe some longer-term outlook when we give additional guidance
but I think like I mention the compare to kind of legacy SeaChange we do not expect that type of significant burn in
okay
and just a follow-up on a press_release you have maybe it be last week where you talk about the increase in streaming and I understand that be obviously what be go_on in the market
but be there any component of framework today where you derive incremental revenue as customer activity increase
it be limit to new component
for instance when customer activity be increase many of we framework customer obviously they will require some more cloud service where we have decent gross margin and some of they will require better analytic as well
this will be positive
also and this be fairly new in place where we be go to take over the advertisement obviously over there there will be meaningful increase
okay
so these be thing that potentially can come into play in the over the next year
where be the head count today
and give the covid-19 situation be you contemplate further shrink head count
yes
so right_now we be at about globally
we have make some change
and I think we just be go to continue to evaluate it on a kind of a monthly and a quarterly basis
I feel like we make a lot of change at the end of we fiscal ' 20 in q3 and q4
and so we kind of feel like we be lean and efficient and can leverage that and we will continue to monitor that go forward
okay
and then a big-picture question
if you have do framework deal remind we how large you customer could you convert
so the legacy install base it be about customer
it be important to note that many many many of the Framework win be from new customer and new functionality
if you be look at we target market so obviously we be not only service the legacy customer that SeaChange use to service
it be not only a cable solution
the vast majority of the framework customer be OTT solution
now when you think about the OTT domain so of course cable provider be there and we will continue to service they and do we best to support they but we also have content provider and content owner
and if you think about content owner for instance I be not suggest that Bloomberg be a customer but Bloomberg be a content owner and Bloomberg and this be public information bloomberg be start a over-the-top direct-to-consumer service
this be not to be confuse with the Bloomberg channel
so this be another type of content provider
so if you think about it the target customer that we be face especially these day so it be a grow tam and it be a significantly grow tam
so in this sense there be a very meaningful opportunity to do much more
and just look at the pipeline that we have go into q1 and pipeline mean that there be a opportunity there be budget and we be the front-runner that be what we call a pipeline
it be the best pipeline we have ever have hundred of million
so be we go to close it all this_year
no
but we do not give a estimate to meet 50_% of we win ratio for this_year to meet we target for the_year
so we feel confident
be the next few month or next few week be go to be challenge
maybe we continue to engage
we will see
be this_year go to be great
yes
okay
and then maybe you hint at some opex expense savings in q1
maybe give we a idea of what kind of year-over-year decline in opex we might see in q1
yes
so we non-gaap operating_expense be $ 9.2 million for q4
and I think we be generally go to be around that run rate for the next couple of quarter or for fiscal ' 21
and that be obviously significantly better than in prior quarter prior year
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street
fully recognize sort of the covid-19 situation make it a bit difficult
just curious if you could comment on you confidence that customer spending be more be push and not be reduce at this time
so Jaeson thanks for the question
some customer be go to push they budget absolutely
but look at the bright side
almost each and every tv provider on the climate this be just like they will have to optimize they opex
who else be go to offer they a solution that will enable they to reduce they opex by up to 50_%
there be no one
look at all the other vendor there be not too many of they but the other vendor that be sell multiple component for video delivery platform
they have a very long and complex price list which have nothing to do with the operator need and the operator opex challenge
and we be there
we have value-based engagement it be unique
so be we go to see some customer that be go to delay they budget
yes sure
be we go to go to see more of those
I think it be fair to say that we already see some of those or many of those
okay
that be helpful
and I know you mention a pretty impressive win rate
but just curious what tend to be the primary pushback from customer today with not go with the Framework deal
so we report win
and I say that we win rate be over 75 % also may be slightly more than that
so we lose very very few opportunity
in the 25 % that we do not win I be also include deal that be push to this_year
so we lose very very few opportunity
it be hard to say
we lose so few so and each one have its own reason for lose it
and lose be not only to another vendor in some case lose it mean that we initiate engagement and we be not able to convince the customer to close the engagement within the_year
and then just a quick question on the Framework plug-in store
be this really target at a different segment of the market
or be this view more as additive for a customer that already have go with a more kind of broad-based Framework deal
so if you think about the Framework the best analogy probably be a phone
so SeaChange use to have all these gauge component like a CPU a power button a volume button we take all these component and now we be sell the best-in-class phone
each and everyone that have this phone will have access to the App Store to the plug-in
but this be something that be go to be meaningful to each and every framework customer
and within 9 month we be able to win customer deliver the vast majority to vast fast majority of they
I think we should be able to win a more meaningful number this_year
and then once this decent number of framework customer will have access to the framework app store the plug-in if you will we will see some revenue contribution over there as well
we next question come from George Marema with Pareto Ventures
so on the can you illuminate a little bit on the legacy install base
what sort of revenue opportunity in fiscal do that represent to we
so we can convert some of this install base into framework
so the these be customer that be use a SeaChange component
they be not use the framework
the vast majority of they be use one single component with many other component from several vendor
in term of value probably the average value of this of the current install base the average framework value be about $ 2 million to $ 4 million
obviously these be the vast majority of they these be cable provider
so the pace over there be slightly slower
but with the covid-19 impact on the market and the cable segment we should be able to be in a position where maybe in the second half of the_year we be go to be able to convert many of they to the framework
if you think about cable provider similar to or even worse in fact since they have to make investment in the network even the smallest operator to continue and support the grow demand down
we already see this report video ARPU be go down
so we have we back office install that to many cable provider
so we see this as also what they share with we
and you will see that in a public manner probably in a month or so when they will publish they report
so they opex be increase they revenue be decrease we should be able to accelerate the conversion of some of the install base into framework
okay
and then you be it true that although maybe some people be sort of freezing they budget for the moment for the next few week to see what happen
be not some people in video accelerate they plan due to the necessity to go online immediately due to the like movie theater and other content provider need to rush to market
be you see some on the other side of the table increase engagement from certain party
oh yes
sure
absolutely
you see more demand from content owner
some content owner like the one you mention obviously they be look to move very very quick
and the fact that we have a solution run on AWS obviously enable we to go to production fairly quickly
for instance there be a customer in the Nordics that we be able to take the production with hundred of thousand of subscriber within very very few month
so we see more demand
and I believe that we have the right solution to support this demand
okay
be you notice any trend among region like be Europe stronger or weaker North_America stronger or weaker Latin America stronger weaker in q1 here right_now
any geography trend
yes
so we have in term of opportunity size I think it be fair to say that what we have today go into q1 and obviously this be a pipeline that we build last_year the deal that we see today be significantly significantly higher than everything that we have manage to close last_year
and obviously the larger deal require a longer engagement cycle but now we be get there
in term of new demand most of the new demand be in the Americas where some content provider content owner be faster to react
Europe overall be a more conservative market so it be move slightly slower over there in term of new demand not current demand
now if you think about the Framework it be be out only for less than 9 month
so we start to offer the framework for less than 9 month for last_year
we start to offer the Framework we introduce the framework at NAB of last_year this be in April
and then we start to deliver within 60 day or so after the introduction of the framework
so overall the success be quite good
and the fact that we have this great this amazing pipeline it be because of reason because of the fact that we have the right technology and obviously customer acknowledge that and also the value-based engagement which enable we especially during this these day to take new content provider in a way that will enable they to launch a service with cost control and current tv provider in a way that will enable they to control they opex
okay
and be you guy still expect somewhere in the ballpark of a similar service revenue per quarter the next couple of quarter for the
so we will sorry go ahead Mike
yes
so obviously the service revenue be a big piece of legacy SeaChange
we will definitely see a decline in that in the next couple of quarter
so service revenue for q4 be $ 6 million
we still have probably maybe $ 5 million to $ 10 million in total of legacy revenue to transition through the_year but you will see a decline in the service and then that will be offset with a increase in product revenue which be primarily what the framework revenue be
and when you sell a framework deal be there any service component that get bleed through with all component
yes
there be and so no there be a component
so roughly it be maybe say
so if it be a $ 3 million deal it be generally piece
it be $ 2 million of a software license and then the remain $ 1 million be a service and support agreement and that be generally over the term of the contract which be generally 4 to 5 year
so that other $ 1 million would come in ratably
and so and you can see this in we table in the press_release
we be start to build up a piece of the framework that be recur
but obviously give that mix with be spread over the life you be see that build but it be at a smaller scale right_now
and on the Framework be it earn monthly quarterly or annually payment
how be the cash_flow those revenue in the out year
so the model typically there be revenue recognition and there be cash
so revenue I think we go through the piece right with a license when we deliver it and then ratable
generally the first kind of deal or so that we sell with the new go-to-market we have be spread the payment term out ratably
so in that same $ 3 million deal where we just walk through where we revenue come in from a billing perspective that will be ratable over the 4 to 5 year
and you bill once a year or once a quarter or once a what
sorry
they be generally once a year or once a quarter
the most part I would say majority be annually
yes
so there would be kind of when they sign a contract and then
so on a $ 5 million deal over 5 year you get $ 1 million year $ 1 million year all of this
so if you have build it April 1 of 2019 it would be $ 1 million April 1 , 2019 $ 1 million April 1 , 2020 $ 1 million April 1 , 2021
be that how they go
Correct yes
there be no further question at this time
I will turn the floor back to Mr. Yossi Aloni for close remark
thank you
thank you everyone for join we today for the SeaChange fourth quarter fiscal 2020 conference
you may now disconnect
thank you
this conclude today 's conference
all party may disconnect
have a great evening
good afternoon everyone
on behalf of simulation plus I welcome you to we second quarter fiscal year 2020 financial result conference call and webinar
host the call today be Simulations Plus CEO Shawn O'Connor and the company 's CFO John Kneisel
we quarterly earnings release should be available momentarily and expect to have this before we get into the main detail of the earnings call today
a opportunity to ask question will follow today 's presentation
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb-
before beginning I would like to remind everyone that with the exception of historical information the matter discuss in this presentation be forward-looking statement that involve a number of risk and uncertainty
the actual result of the company could differ significantly from those statement
factor that can cause or contribute to such difference include but be not limit to continue demand for the company 's product competitive factor the company 's ability to finance future growth the company 's ability to produce and market new product in a timely fashion the company 's ability to continue to attract and retain skilled personnel and the company 's ability to sustain or improve the current level of productivity
further information on the company 's risk factor be contain in the company 's quarterly annual report and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
with that say I would like to turn the call over to CEO Shawn O'Connor
Shawn
thank you Cameron
this be certainly a eventful and historical quarter for simulation plus and for all of we
I would like to start the call by express my hope that you and you family be all healthy and safe in these uncertain time
while we all may be feel a bit homebound at this point I encourage everyone to adhere to the guideline and precaution that keep you and you family best protect during these time
thankfully the impact of the COVID pandemic on we here at simulation plus have be relatively minimal to date
I will elaborate on the COVID impact in we response later in the call
but first I would like to comment with regard to we recently announce acquisition and operating result for the_quarter
subsequent to the end of the quarter we acquire Lixoft of the Paris France the developer of the highly regard Monolix
suite
Monolix be a pk/pd modeling platform that support the pharmacometrician workflow with datum exploration to model fitting through to clinical trial stimulation
this acquisition do several thing for we
first it immediately expand we presence in Europe with new employee and strong experienced executive management
second it rebalance we mix of software and consult revenue follow acquisition of business that be more weighted to consult
Lixoft 's revenue be 99 % annual software licens with consistently high renewal rate which we believe will benefit from we sale and marketing channel
Third Lixoft have historically turn away consult opportunity and we believe that we will be able to respond to this market opportunity with we consulting resource create a new source of revenue
and finally the acquisition be immediately accretive with revenue growth performance in we target of 15 % to 20 % revenue growth and operating and ebitda margin that exceed we exist performance
I welcome Jérôme Kalifa Lixoft 's Cofounder and Chairman and Jonathan Chauvin Lixoft 's Chief_Executive_Officer to we executive management team and I also welcome the whole Lixoft team to the simulation plus family
with regard to we operating result simulation plus deliver another strong quarter of execution
as you may recall we state goal be to deliver organic revenue growth of 15 % to 20_%
and once again we exceed this goal with 22 % growth
this be we third consecutive quarter with revenue growth in excess of 20_%
we software revenue grow 12 % in line with prior period
these strong result be achieve despite lower-than-anticipated new license business from we asian distributor where COVID impact be first be feel in February
specifically we see about $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 of new business in Asia slip out of the_second_quarter more with regard to COVID dilemma
we service revenue growth be strong across each of we division come in overall at 35 % growth
the Lancaster team be busy with many collaboration we have announce over the past several month
Cognigen be operate at capacity with full backlog and dilisym grow this_quarter at 45 % down from they 89 % growth in the_first_quarter but still excellent and more in line with we capacity
we gross margin improve to 74 % overall benefit from a seasonally higher software quarter
we mix be 52 % software with margin of 85 % and 48 % consultant with margin of 63 %
net income to ebitda as a percentage of revenue be generally within historical level but impact by onetime transaction expense relate to the Lixoft acquisition
John will speak to these in detail later in the call
let I now speak in more detail to the impact of covid on we business
operationally about 40 % of we workforce already work remotely and nearly everyone be equip to do so
as a result the transition to 100 % work from home have go quite smoothly
indeed we entire workforce be now work remotely and productivity be essentially unchanged
we industry have see the cancellation of most conference
we be conduct training and workshop virtually and we have transition sale activity from face-to-face meeting to virtual meeting
we even complete a acquisition this_quarter remotely
I believe and early result reinforce that simulation plus be well position to weather this storm compare to other company
we have a strong balance_sheet with ample cash we have generate year of consistent profitability and we exercise prudent expense management
even after the use of cash to complete the Lixoft acquisition we cash position of approximately $ 8 million be adequate and exceed we cash position subsequent to we previous acquisition
we recently secure a line of credit not out of cash flow concern but rather as a minimal cost insurance policy
rate for such facility be excellent cost to put they in place be minimal and there be no fee related to unused credit during the term of the line of credit
the line of credit serve as a insurance should the need arise in the_future
additionally a significant portion of we revenue come from the renewal of software on annual licens with very high renewal rate
Lixoft operate on a similar model with renewal rate that be very similar to ours
so the acquisition further bolster we recur revenue
we have see no impact to date on renewal rate
finally we service business operate off a large undertake a detailed review combine with ongoing interaction with we client and have identify less than 10_% of the backlog at risk of delay or cancellation at this time but we continue to monitor this status
where we have see impact be in the secure of new business at historical rate
I previously mention that we see $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 in new software licens excuse I in Asia slip out into the_second_quarter
Asia continue to be impact where in some region infrastructure for work at home be not as robust as we experience here in the States
that say this important this impact on new license sale be feel not just in Asia but in all geography
thus far we have see no measurable decrease in demand however buy decision be be delay as company wait for clarity into the economic impact of the pandemic change to they development plan and investment and visibility into when the stay-at-home situation will begin to abate
we continue to close new software license business but at slower than historical pace
as a result we new software pipeline be grow
with regard to we service business we also see a slowdown in closure of new business
as you know we work with client be sometimes in support of new clinical trial or post analysis of clinical trial performance which in today 's environment have be stall
the direct development industry have focus its attention on covid-related program be manage the disruptive impact on currently active clinical trial and evaluate exist plan for future clinical trial and program in general
further lab facility integral to testing have be disrupt impact the generation of datum available for analysis
all without certainty as to when the work environment will return to normal
new business discussion continue but at a slow and cautious pace
we continue to close new service business but at a pace behind historical level
similar to we software business we new business pipeline be grow
on a positive note we have recently initiate new service offering which add to we new service opportunity
first a global regulatory strategy offer strategiesplus lead by a significant new addition to the team from the FDA
and secondly the StrategiesPlus COVID ACT Program to speed consult assistance to any organization involve in the coronavirus research
as part of this initiative each division of simulation plus have identify covid-related product application and service to provide specialized expertise which will contribute to develop safe and effective treatment
these new service offering and the addition of the Lixoft software revenue stream and the potential for monolix-based consulting service agreement all represent incremental revenue opportunity introduce in the last quarter
all positive for the_future
nonetheless the near term be dependent upon the uncertainty of the COVID impact in term of the timing and nature of we client go-forward plan
in summary we business be fare better than most in today 's COVID environment

I will take a breath and let I now turn the call over to John to review more detailed financial result
John
thanks a lot Shawn
look at the_quarter here
first we consolidated net revenue for the_second_quarter of we fiscal year ' 20 be up 22 % or $ 1.9 million to $ 10.3 million compare to $ 8.5 million in the_prior_year
total gross profit increase 23 % to $ 7.7 million represent a 74.2 % gross margin in the_second_quarter of this fiscal year compare to a 73.9 % margin in the same quarter last year
sg&a expense be $ 4.1 million or 40 % of revenue in the second quarter of this year a increase of approximately $ 1.3 million or 46 % compare to $ 2.8 million or 33 % of revenue in the second quarter of ' 19
the increase in sg&a expense be primarily the result of increase in salary wages labor and stock compensation cost as the company have grow in headcount to support we revenue growth
we have also see increase in selling expense commission and advertising some contract labor also
in addition this_quarter we incur about $ 300,000 of m&a related due diligence cost associate with the Lixoft acquisition
without these transactions-related cost the SG&A would have be approximately 37 % of revenue
SG&A expense in the_third_quarter will be also be impact by transaction cost associate with the Lixoft acquisition
Research and development cost for the most recent fiscal quarter be approximately $ 1.4 million
of this total $ 748,000 be expense and $ 620,000 be capitalize
income from operation for the second quarter of the year be $ 2.8 million up approximately $ 96,000 or 3.5 % compare to $ 2.7 million in the year ago quarter
we provision for income tax in the_second_quarter of_fiscal year '20 be about $ 686,000 a effective rate of 24.2 % compare to a effective rate of 22.1 % in the_prior_year
we expect we tax rate to be in the 23 % to 25 % range for this fiscal year
net income increase by approximately 2.4 % or $ 51,000 to $ 2.2 million in the most recent quarter compare to $ 2.1 million a year ago
on a per share basis net income be $ 0.12 per diluted share in the_second_quarter of both this fiscal year and last fiscal year
the transaction expense lower eps by just over $ 0.01 per share
ebitda be $ 3.5 million this_quarter up slightly compare to $ 3.4 million in the year ago quarter
now go_on to the year-to-date number
Consolidated net revenue year-to-date be up 23.4 % or $ 3.7 million to $ 19.8 million compare to $ 16 million in the year ago
we gross margin for the first 6 month be 73.1 % compare to 72.5 %
sg&a expense include the $ 300,000 of transaction-related cost be $ 7.6 million or 38.6 % of revenue compare to 34.5 % for the same period last_year
expense effectively unchanged from the prior period or the_prior_year excuse I
income from operation for the period be $ 5.5 million compare to $ 4.8 million and net income increase by approximately $ 600,000 or about 16 % to $ 4.2 million compare to $ 3.6 million
ebitda be $ 6.8 million year-to-date up 10.5 % compare to $ 6.2 million the_prior_year
turn to the next slide
this slide show we revenue on a quarterly basis from fiscal year 2016 to the second quarter of 2020 illustrate both historical quarterly growth pattern and the seasonality of the business
seasonality can best be see use the purple bar
we third quarter be typically we strongest quarter with a decrease in revenue in the_fourth_quarter that coincide with the slowdown in we client purchasing in the summer month
we first and second quarter this year follow the same upward trend
the next slide represent income by quarter which illustrate a consistent track record of increase both year-over-year and sequentially through the first and third quarter with the_fourth_quarter as we talk a little bit lighter for the_year
as you can see the pattern for quarterly revenue and quarterly income from operation have largely hold true for quite a number of year
this slide we can see that similar pattern of net income with the_third_quarter typically be the strongest
we isolate the impact of a $ 1.5 million defer tax benefit in the_second_quarter of_fiscal year '18 since it tend to skew the presentation without highlight that difference
on the next slide dilute earnings per share follow the same pattern and track with net income as expect
as I mention earlier fiscal year '20 second quarter dilute earnings per share be $ 0.12 exclude the $ 300,000 of transaction cost relate to Lixoft as I indicate before earnings would have be a $ 0.01 more
turn to EBITDA
again we expect the seasonal pattern to hold true with the overall trend move upward and typically seasonal with typical seasonality between the_quarter
just a note here regard the trend in these slide
Shawn have cover what we currently see related to covid-19 after what be effectively only 1 month into the pandemic 's effect
no one be able to fully predict the full impact
but base on we annual renewal model for software revenue we would expect the seasonal nature of these trend to continue
we will be continually monitor for change
this slide show we revenue by region
we be a global business with the majority of we revenue in the western Hemisphere approximately 68 % of revenue be in the Americas
Asia and Europe each represent 16 % of the total revenue for we current year
move on to we cash position slide
this slide show the strength of we cash position with a quarterly view of we cash balance and how we have use fund for dividend and acquisition over the period
observe the red balance line we can see that the low point of cash or at the time when the company have invest in new acquisition
the company show pattern of cash accumulation post major acquisition date
begin with the_first_quarter of_fiscal year ' 17 on the far left the blue bar at the bottom illustrate we consistent dividend payout
approximately $ 900,000 per fiscal year through that through fiscal ' 17
at the beginning of 2018 the Board increase the dividend payment to $ 0.06 a share thereby return approximately $ 1 million to $ 1.1 million in cash to we shareholder quarterly through the present quarter
today on we press_release we announce that the Board have again continue the $ 0.06 quarterly dividend and the next dividend payment will be May 1
continue with the chart the green bar represent cash use for acquisition
cash flow from operation have allow we to invest for future growth through acquisition with the extra cash while keep and maintain a healthy balance_sheet
we reinvestment through acquisition have exceed $ 15 million over the last 4 to 5 fiscal year while also return more than $ 15 million to we shareholder through this consistent dividend payment without take on any borrower debt
subsequent to the_quarter as Shawn mention earlier we establish a line of credit in the amount of $ 3.5 million
under term of this agreement at we discretion we either pay interest at the prime rate or a fixed rate base on LIBOR plus 1.75 % on fund draw
it be a 2-year term with the agreement and there be no charge on fund for underused line fee
the agreement require the company to satisfy certain financial covenant relative to profitability ebitda and annually require the company to maintain a balance for a 30-day period
while credit provide we cash management capability into the_future
move on to the next slide
at the end of the year again we talk in the_quarter we cash be $ 12.2 million which be up 7 % compare to we fiscal year
we balance_sheet be clearly stronger today than a year ago as a direct result of we increase earnings power cash flow generation and prudent allocation of capital
Shawn I will turn the call back to you now
thank you John
we be all navigate a new world impact by this unprecedented pandemic
thus far we fare better than most and be well position to continue we long track record of success even in these challenging time
I be excite to add Lixoft to we already strong and diverse organization help grow we european presence and improve we revenue mix
demand for we solution remain strong although we will likely see some measure of delay in new business as we customer deal with the ramification and uncertainty this pandemic have cause
and with that I would like to turn it over and take any question you might have
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- at this time I will as we wait and poll for question go through some of the early written question that be have be submit
actually we be go to take the question first from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb-
and thank you for provide some detail on the coronavirus
maybe just to dig in on that a little bit more and I realize that this be a ever-evolving situation
but as you be talk to you client and you be see news that some of they be maybe push out some of they trial start or continuation of trial
what be the feedback that you be get from they
be they wait for 30 day and then they be go to get back to you
be they say you know what we be just go to push the trial start date from maybe instead of May 1 we be go to push it to June 1
just any incremental color on what you be hear from the client would be helpful
yes Matt I appreciate the question
and obviously everyone in most all regard be look for that date certain that the trend turn downward that certainty or visibility to return to normalcy will take place
and unfortunately no one have that crystal ball
and so discussion with client they be influx
they be evaluate they be reallocate resource
you see the focus on covid-related development opportunity that be be pursue there be a lot of movement in that direction
exist plan where other therapeutic area and development be be hold to but be cautious right_now they be not point to we be go to defer this from April 1 start to June 1 start be we be go to defer it from we plan at April 1 start without a date identify go forward
I think we be all operate in a environment in which we would be able to plan better if we know when the curve bend downward and that uncertainty just keep we all in a wait-and-see mode
and I think that be the characteristic of the term that we get from client
it be a little bit wait and see how thing evolve here over the coming day week and hopefully not too many month
Understood
and then regard the Lixoft acquisition congratulation look like a great fit and you even touch on some of the potentially cross-selling opportunity
how quickly especially give the current environment how quickly do you anticipate be able to integrate that business and see some of the benefit from the cross-selling
I mean we be get certainly these thing do take some time but we have be plan in anticipation of the announcement that we have make last week
and so that number of effort plan engagement point between the new organization and be start to take hold in the coming month I think the plan both in term of sale and marketing as well as product development will begin to take shape
I think that there be area where there be a population of consult opportunity that be out there all subject to the same covid issue that we have address already here
but I think in that regard there be a flow of business that be wait for someone to catch it
and now with we consulting resource we should be able to pick up the ball there relatively quickly
so I think thing will move very quickly in this regard
it be a product space that be not be adjacent to we familiar to we
we client be the same
and so we ability to consolidate sale and marketing effort should go very smooth and very quickly
okay
and then maybe one last one for I and I will hop back in the queue
regard the new regulatory strategy team maybe a little more color there as far as how should we be think about the size of those contract the duration how what be that pipeline look like
I realize it be early day but be there a pipeline that be building
and when do you anticipate sign the first contract
sure
it be exciting
Sandra have be on board maybe a month now
and we have reach out into the marketplace and we have get a we get immediate positive response
she be well-known well-regarded in the pharma community and get a lot of accolade back from the marketplace in term of great to hear that she be join the organization a lot of excitement around that
yes it be very quickly it generate a number of lead that we be manage through
right_now the type of project and I guess I would describe sort of scenario one opportunity that be regulatory advisory project in and of themselves mean that be the point of the project and the service
and then secondly in the breadth of the consulting offering the project that we do include in those project some allotment of a time
and use of Sandra 's advice in effect other project we mainstream project if you will to get that regulatory advice and color and expertise that Sandra bring to the table
so she will fit into or drive the stand-alone new project as well as contribute and add to the flow of exist consulting project that we perform
thank you
at this time we will walk through some of the write question
the first question have come from Howard Halpern
you state the acquisition of Lixoft will add approximately $ 3.5 million to the revenue
give the continued lockdown in Europe be that still attainable
and how do the margin profile
and over time what be the plan to integrate it into the general consulting service
okay
let I get to the first point in term of revenue expectation what we disclose be that they close the calendar year 2019 with $ 3.4 million in revenue
that mean that they enter the calendar year traditionally enjoy that the vast majority 90-plus percent of the $ 3.4 million should renew and recur into the calendar year '20 with we fiscal year of August year-end we get in term of mismatch in term of the time frame so I understand but the point be that they base business which be recur revenue be at $ 3.5 million level
and so expectation be pretty high that we should be able to continue that into we fiscal year ' 21
it be not highly dependent upon new software licensing
so we certainly expect that not to be during this time frame
so on the margin side there gross margin operate income ebitda percentage on a stand-alone basis over the prior 2 year all exceed be at or exceed we percentage in those regard of revenue in term of they model performance
so they should add to and might in a small way improve we percentage result in term of EBITDA percentage of revenue operating income
in the last it be with regard to consulting how quick that would come on board
there be sale cycle that be involve there
we know we have get lead can get lease pretty quickly
but now we be in that environment of covid-9 -lrb- sic -rrb- -lsb- covid-19 -rsb- so hard to say in term of the speed of that sale cycle closure
thank you Shawn
the next follow-up question from Howard be have you increase the use of webinar virtual conference to offset the some 20-plus conference and presentation you attend in a given year
and do you expect any impact on you future customer in obtain they
yes
we certainly go virtual as many have on the business world virtual in the sense of we webinar we training workshop each of the division have move plan event into that format
and so we utilize that significantly
we have translate face-to-face sale meeting with virtual meeting
so we be keep the pace of the activity go
no doubt there be some slowness that creep in as into the process as we have talk about
but yes we be leverage the virtual world as best as we can
and with this one additional question from Howard be have the pipeline of consult service across all
yes
as I have say the pipeline have actually grow as we have have a slower pace on the closure end of the sale cycle the amount of the business that we be work in we pipeline have grow
certainly some of the opportunity have fall off
but the addition to the pipeline have far exceed the fallout there
and that be true across all business
there still be some -lsb- cognigen -rsb- and the consulting work we do have to take care
so
thank you Shawn
and we be go back to a live question a follow-up question from Matt Hewitt of Craig-Hallum
maybe I guess just one last one here
as you look at the sale force I think you be up to
and do Lixoft bring also bring any sale resource
or be that a area where you still maybe could look to add any head there
yes
Lixoft bring a sale organization of Jonathan the CEO who be the primary sale front to the organization
support the Round # 10 other Lixoft employee split pretty equally between software development personnel and application personnel application personnel be those that support client face demonstration customer service and support training and workshop et_cetera
so we have get a excellent sale person in Jonathan that be come on board
and we need go forward not immediate in term of addition because of the acquisition the join of Lixoft and in fact it give we the immediate benefit of have a senior sales-oriented executive like that in the geography
and just as we will be come up to speed in term of be able to front the lixoft product here in the U.S. have they up to speed in term of be able to front we product in Europe as well in this process
we have a few more follow-up write question
first one come from -lsb- Karl Hoffman -rsb-
and how do the Lixoft software complement or potentially overlap any slp exist software
it be mostly a adjacent product
it be a product in pk/pd modeling world that cover a modeling it be a modeling platform but it allow the scientist to run from datum exploration to the building of pk model to primarily NOME be the type of modeling technique that it have engine for and then run simulation off of that clinical trial simulation to the adjacent product to we pd/pk platform in gastric class
there be some functionality that cross over but it be relatively minimal
thank you Shawn
and one final follow-up question for Howard Halpern
have there be any material change to you operating expense profile during this current pandemic environment and exclude the transaction cost as mention what be the expectation for percentage of sale for the remainder of the_year on a operate basis sg&a cost
well United and Marriott have call I up and ask I where I have be over the last 8 year -lsb- 6 week -rsb-
so I guess there probably be some expense that we be avoid in this sort of work style but I be be a little facetious I do not think it be dramatic but certainly there be on the travel side
there be no we do not incur a tremendous expense related to take we workforce off-site
much of it be already in place
most all employee be set up such that even if they work in office that they have the capability of work from home on a temporary basis
so there be no great expenditure in term of cost involve in the transition in that regard
SG&A exclude the impact of closing of the transaction and expense that will continue to flow into the_third_quarter related to it
I think should continue to move as we have be for the last number of quarter have step up in the lower revenue seasonality quarter above the 35 % you will see that the average out with we second and third quarter which be the higher revenue quarter
and we have be look at keep it as close as we can on the 35 % for the_year as a whole
I do not see anything that be change in that regard other than the uncertainty be the top line in term of we top line growth with covid impact
thank you Shawn
it appear there be no further additional question
with that I conclude the conference_call

as part of the global health care community collaborate to fight this pandemic we be actively work with multiple customer to develop covid-19 treatment and a vaccine
this battle require unparalleled speed without compromise safety and regulatory requirement
customer be reach out to we for everything from stand up trial to target communication for accelerate enrollment to crisis communication to help they organization manage through this challenging time
we also want to thank the frontline health care professional include many of we own Syneos Health clinically qualify volunteer who have be icu bind boldly fight the pandemic
they bravery be incredible and we be grateful for they work to protect we all
lastly before we get into the first quarter detail I want to thank all of my Syneos Health colleague for they shared strength during this time
I be incredibly proud of we team for live we value of challenge the status quo collaborate to deliver solution and exhibit the passion to change life which have keep we culture resilient and strong
we believe we commitment to collaborate with customer site and the public health community will sustain and advance we collective effort during this pandemic and beyond
turn now to we financial result
let I start by say that despite the near-term challenge we remain confident in the long-term strength of we business and strategy give we robust backlog and the unique market position we have create
the momentum in we business that begin to accelerate in carry over into we q1 2020 result and we expect it to continue to build as the impact of covid-19 subside
after discuss the result for the_first_quarter I will take some time today to detail how we be address the effect of covid-19 and the different impact and trend we be see across the business
but first let I start with we key highlight from the_quarter
first we close q1 with strong net new business award inclusive of a record first quarter for clinical result in a book-to-bill ratio of x for clinical Solutions x for commercial Solutions and x for we total company
this bring we to $ 5.7 billion of net award and a aggregate book-to-bill ratio of x for the trail 12-month period
second we clinical business continue to show strong performance with year-over-year growth of 8.5 % or 9.2 % in constant currency
Third we remain confident in we overall financial position and liquidity
at the end of the quarter we have $ 336 million in cash and $ 281 million of capacity available on we revolve credit facility
we expect to generate free cash_flow for the remainder of and have take proactive step to further preserve capital and provide financial flexibility which Jason will describe in more detail
now go into the detail of we result
we have a solid quarter overall especially consider the rapidly change macro environment during March
total adjusted revenue grow 3.8 % or 4.4 % in constant currency which be in line with we expectation
in addition to strong revenue growth clinical Solutions deliver a record first quarter of net award result in a total clinical net award of $ 4.5 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of x for the trail 12-month period
these award be broad-based as we continue to establish and deepen we presence in top pharma through we new preferred provider relationship
this consistency of award flow be one of the strategic benefit of grow we share with top pharma customer
we year-over-year clinical backlog growth accelerate to 12.3 % and we pipeline of new opportunity remain robust
we do not experience any meaningful cancellation in we clinical segment related to covid-19 although we have see some customer slow award decision or postpone start date for award program
we commercial Solutions segment experience a revenue decline of 8.1 % compare to the_prior_year primarily due to a unfavorable revenue mix and lower-than-anticipated reimbursable expense
although the team finish the_quarter with relatively strong award the award be offset somewhat by higher contemplate in we full year revenue forecast
however they do occur earlier in the_year than expect thus impact book-to-bill
this result in $ 1.3 billion of net award and a book-to-bill of x for the trail 12-month period
we pipeline of commercial opportunity remain robust give some delay in customer decision and increase rfp volume
as we turn to covid-specific commentary protect the health and safety of we employee customer and industry colleague be paramount in we response
we response be lead by a business continuity transition management Office or TMO which combine the project management discipline of the trust process with we well-established transition management leadership
this group manage and monitor employee safety and we rapid and seamless transition to remote operation all while ensure consistent business performance
the TMO be now plan the next phase in we covid-19 response which be the safe return to a more traditional operating model when appropriate
we anticipate that this will occur in phase over several month and we will be ready to deploy we field team and reopen we facility in this new normal
we have also focus on source personal protective equipment establish office cleaning and safety protocol and staging personnel to return base upon prioritization criterion
in the meantime we will continue to comply with all appropriate protocol and government mandate
in addition to the decisive action we have take to protect we employee and ensure business continuity we have also support the public health response within we local community
from the onset we have extend we fight against the pandemic by engage in public health initiative to address acute need in local community where we talent and expertise can help
let I share a few example
firstly across collaborative medical and communication team create a public service educational initiative to raise awareness of the use of bi-level positive airway pressure or bipap machine to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation for intubate covid-19 patient
we staff in the U.K. answer the call also in collaboration with other ACRO member to participate as volunteer to increase the level of covid-19 testing
and as mention we also enable we clinically qualified medical staff to practice during this time add further strength to the global pandemic response
we be very proud of we people and these initiative
the wave of passion and energy within Syneos Health to help patient have be magnify with we employee and team that be ready to do whatever they can to be a part of the solution
with that broader context I think it would be helpful to detail some of the impact we be experience and how we be respond
let 's start with the full-service portion of we clinical Solutions segment represent about 60 % of we total revenue
it be important to note that over 70 % of we clinical business comprise of essential therapeutic area that we believe may see reduce impact such as oncology rare disease and orphan disease and other complex disease area where patient have limit treatment option
we clinical team have experience limitation access investigative site although only about 10_% be inaccessible
of the remainder 80 % to 90 % be allow at least some level of virtual activity and we have see these trend continue into April
overall this environment primarily impact clinical monitoring activity which comprise about 30 % of we full-service revenue
we clinical team have do a incredible job of transition to remote monitoring take a leadership position in partnership with ACRO along with other virtual activity
during the_second_quarter we expect to convert 70 % to 80 % of we site visit to remote monitoring use a highly tailor approach with additional follow-up requirement dependent upon a site 's capability to provide remote access to electronic health record platform
while site access have certainly be more limited in the heavily impact region such as China Italy and Spain we have continue to conduct at least some live site visit in these area
we have also begin to see site in these area that be impact earlier slowly resume activity
in addition we clinical team have experience delay in both patient enrollment and the start-up of new clinical trial
New patient enrollment be down significantly thus far in April drive primarily by some of we customer take a short-term pause to ensure patient safety and continuity within they trial
although we be continue to make progress on the regulatory ethic and other work that precede site activation itself such that we stand ready to move quickly on the final start-up activity
in a effort to drive further billable activity we clinical team be accelerate recruitment in less affected region accelerate other billable activity such as trial master file work and reassign staff
we clinical functional service provider or fsp business represent about 11 % of we total revenue
these team have see similar impact on they ability to access investigative site but that only impact clinical monitoring service which be about 50_% of fsp revenue
it be important to note that most team within fsp be contract on a fte basis not base upon unit of activity
therefore shorter term disruption be less likely to impact revenue from exist team particularly give they embedded knowledge of we customer process study and system
the remainder of we fsp business comprise function like biometric datum management and safety which have traditionally perform most of they work remotely
we early phase business within clinical which represent only about 2 % of we total revenue include the clinic that represent the small portion of we business that require on-site operational staff
we have temporarily scale back we clinic because we be unable to host group of healthy volunteer due to safety concern and we be also see customer delay some of they related program
however we bioanalytical and translational medicine lab within this business continue to operate
move to we commercial Solutions segment where Deployment Solutions represent the largest component at about 17 % of we total revenue
in this business we believe the nature of we customer base the mix of the product we support and the type of health care provider location we interact with will position we integrate service to remain a essential component of commercialization for we customer
note that Deployment Solutions currently drive over 60 % of its revenue from top pharma where product portfolio be more diverse and stable
over 80 % of we Deployment Solutions field team be support chronic care therapy a category where total prescription volume have remain stable
approximately 90 % of we current call activity be in physician office or outside of the hospital setting where covid-19 treatment concentration be not prevalent
while we Deployment Solutions field team have face limitation on they ability to physically visit they health care provider or hcp they have quickly transition to virtual activity enable by the breadth of we capability
we learning solution and engagement center team collaborate during March to train we field rep to effectively manage virtual activity give travel restriction while take into consideration the capacity of each individual office and customer preferred protocol
by mid-march 90 % of we field team have be successfully transition to a virtual work-from-home environment
by mid-april the weekly volume of we field team 's virtual interaction with we hcp have nearly match the level of in-person interaction that be occur prior to covid-19
this transition have be enable by we investment in omni-channel capability over the last 2 year
we be also see significant customer interest in we engagement center which be enable with multichannel to engage customer include telephony video and digital tool
this interest along with increase interest in hybrid representative demonstrate we customer interest in evaluate modify commercial model
it be also important to note that we Deployment solution field team be similar to we clinical fsp business in that they be primarily contract on a fte basis
in addition the majority of these contract have substantial termination notice period of up to 120 day
while this also make they less vulnerable to shorter-term disruption like a fsp we have begin to see customer delay the start-up of new program and the backfilling of open position
the communication business which comprise about 8 % of we total revenue be more important now than ever help we customer communicate to they key stakeholder
a recent survey we complete of over hcp confirm they need to continue to stay abreast of new therapy and datum as well as they desire for information and material to support treatment decision
the majority of we communication business be direct to hcp rather than consumer or other audience and do not include meaningful media buying revenue
we be also see healthy year-over-year growth in we pipeline of opportunity across communication
like we Deployment Solutions business the covid-related impact have primarily be slower decision around new business award
lastly within commercial Solutions we consulting business represent about 2 % of we overall revenue
this business already operate in a virtual work environment
so it have be largely unaffected by covid-19
in fact we see continued strength across all of we consulting practice area in the_first_quarter with a robust backlog of work go into April
over 85 % of we consulting business be in health care which have prove to be more durable than the broader consulting market
further we practice include commercial and medical affair strategy where we help customer reevaluate they launch strategy of new product give the change environment
it also include risk evaluation and mitigation strategy and regulatory quality and compliance practice program which be largely drive by regulatory requirement
finally we have implement cost reduction and cash preservation initiative in all area and have additional measure plan and ready to implement if need which Jason will outline in more detail
we be balance these measure with we commitment to maintain excellent delivery quality and quickly reaccelerate any impacted activity for the benefit of we customer
now let I turn it over to Jason for more comment on we financial performance
Jason
thank you Alistair and good morning everyone
in navigate the unprecedented circumstance of a global pandemic and its impact on we business I realize and appreciate even more the importance of have a strong resilient organization with a collaborative culture
to that end I want to take a moment to thank my entire team for they incredible work to support the company and all of we stakeholder during this challenging time
after I take you briefly through we first quarter result I will spend some time outline the proactive step we be take to manage the impact of covid-19
as show on slide we revenue for the first quarter of 2020 be $ 1.16 billion up 3.8 % and up 4.4 % in constant currency compare to the first quarter of 2019 on a adjusted basis
slide show that we clinical Solutions revenue grow 8.5 % or 9.2 % in constant currency to $ 874.8 million for the_first_quarter on a adjusted basis
the growth in clinical Solutions revenue in the_first_quarter be primarily drive by higher revenue from net new business award and higher growth in reimbursable expense partially offset by the impact of fx
revenue growth be somewhat stronger-than-anticipated in we real-world and late phase business as we continue to further penetrate that market
while clinical outperform we expectation in January and February we do begin to see revenue pressure in March related to covid-19
however we clinical team continue to focus on drive trial continuity plan and ensure patient safety
we anticipate that we will recover revenue for the majority of these covid-19 related activity in the second half of the_year
move to slide as expect we first quarter commercial segment revenue decline 8.1 % year-over-year to $ 288.5 million and decline 8 % in constant currency
the decline in commercial revenue during the_first_quarter be drive primarily by unfavorable revenue mix and slower growth in reimbursable expense
adjust ebitda for the_first_quarter be $ 137.4 million a increase of 1.8 % year-over-year result in a adjusted ebitda margin of 11.8 % a decrease of basis_point compare to the first quarter of 2019
the decline in adjusted ebitda margin for the_first_quarter be primarily drive by commercial Solutions margin contraction partially offset by clinical Solutions margin growth
adjust diluted ep of $ 0.68 for the_first_quarter grow by 15.3 % year-over-year drive by lower interest expense and growth in adjusted ebitda
as it relate to guidance give the uncertainty surround both the magnitude and duration of the impact of covid-19 on we business and we customer we will not provide financial guidance at this time
we will continue to monitor the situation while stay in close contact with we customer and plan to provide a update as soon as possible take into account all the fact and circumstance
to evaluate the expect impact of covid-19 on we business we have prepare and evaluate forecast under a variety of different scenario
while we currently expect that the impact to we revenue will to recover we have develop contingency plan for alternate scenario should the impact be more significant or extend further in duration
accordingly as outline on slide we have implement a number of proactive cost savings measure to minimize margin impact include accelerate certain action in ForwardBound we margin enhancement initiative of organizational and operate model efficiency delay hiring of nonbillable headcount reduce or eliminate third-party cost and nonessential contractor implement temporary salary reduction for we Board of director executive and highly compensate individual suspend we -lrb- k -rrb- match execute voluntary furlough and rationalize we portfolio of service
the collective impact of these proactive measure will vary base on require duration of each
we currently anticipate total cost reduction include reduce reimbursable out-of-pocket expense will allow we to maintain a full year adjust EBITDA margin in the range of 13 % to 14 % generally in line with we result for the full year 2019
we be prepare to extend these reduction further and institute additional more aggressive measure as need
further we have also implement measure to supplement we cash reserve and preserve liquidity and financial flexibility include draw $ 300 million on we revolve credit facility to supplement we cash reserve delay certain capital expenditure pause share repurchase execute interest rate swap to fix variable rate debt at lower interest rate and renegotiate key vendor term
now turn to cash_flow and the balance_sheet as summarize on Slide
during the_first_quarter we operation use $ 38.6 million in cash_flow
although cash_flow from operation be seasonally lower in the first quarter , the first quarter of 2020 be further pressure by higher vendor payment include reimbursable out-of-pocket expense along with incentive compensation partially offset by improve collection and lower restructuring and integration cost
DSO for the_quarter be 50.9 day
give the $ 300 million draw on we revolve credit facility in March we end the_quarter with $ 336 million of unrestricted cash and total debt outstanding of $ 2.97 billion
give the minimal associated cost and out of a abundance of caution we decide to draw down incremental cash on we revolve credit facility during March
it be important to note that we have not yet experience any meaningful working capital impact due to covid-19
slide also provide a update on we debt management and capital deployment activity
we continue to focus on a balanced approach to capital deployment to drive shareholder value which we have always highlight
however the uncertainty of the current environment dictate that we focus on capital preservation while we continue to access the extent and duration of the impact of covid-19
during the_first_quarter we execute additional interest rate swap with a notional value of $ 549.2 million to reduce the cost of we variable rate debt
the execution of these swap also increase the portion of we debt that be effectively fix from 36 % at December 31 , 2019 to 54 % at March 31 , 2020
we also repurchase $ 32 million of we common stock during the first quarter before curtail these purchase in order to preserve liquidity
while this leave a additional $ 136.3 million of repurchase capacity we currently do not intend to repurchase any additional share during the_second_quarter and we will continue to evaluate the program on a quarterly basis as market condition evolve
we non-gaap effective tax rate for the_first_quarter be 24 % and we expect to maintain that rate for the full year of 2020
give the benefit of we NOL deduction we expect we actual net cash outlay for tax in to be approximately $ 20 million
this complete we prepared remark and we would be happy to answer any question
operator
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question or comment come from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird
during a crisis or a downturn it be historically not be unusual for pre-commercial biotech to tap the break sometimes slam on the brake as they preserve capital
I be just curious in the slide you show you make client concentration which be helpful but would you be able to parse out that client diversity a bit more maybe out of by number of account or specifically what portion of that business be actually pre commercial biotech
yes
Eric , it be Alistair
I hope you be do well
I think in the accompany slide there be on Page there be a breakout on the left-hand side that look a little bit at that pre-revenue biotech exposure for clinical which be under 10_%
and then on the commercial side we have some pre-commercial biotech that we do consult for medcomm and market access strategy that kind of thing
so it be quite low
and I think that as we have evolve as a organization over the last couple of year we have move away from this exposure to that pre-revenue biotech to a much more established biotech and the large pharma which help in a situation like this to have that balanced portfolio of customer
do you Alistair do you share my concern or view that perhaps that client base in this environment could be a bit riskier than large pharma
I mean I have hear of both argument during we channel check in the last couple of week but
I think you can look at it couple of way right
so they be the people whose liquidity be go to be most critical
but they be also the section of customer if you like the group of customer where time be they enemy
so any delay to trial any elongation of the trial they have a certain amount of capital on the balance_sheet that they be deploy into the execution of a trial these delay do not help they in if this go through q2 q3 create 6-month additional execution time and they be currently run trial they have get to find the capital to keep go for another 6 month
so I think that will cause some headwind there
but what we have see be we be very cautious when we take on new customer in that sector to look at they liquidity and they ability to fund the trial all the way through
and I think we feel comfortable about the set that we work with that we connect with be well capitalize manage they work well
and we have be able to connect with they have meaningful conversation with they about how we be try to keep the trial run either through remote activity or push more recruitment into unaffected area at this time
so yes I think this you can look at that both way
they be the people who might not place a trial at the moment because of liquidity issue and clarity on how long it be go to last
but again these be the organization where time be not they friend and they have get that push to get back on with it as quickly as they can or continue go as much as they can
that be really helpful
if I could get one more quick one in to Jason
Jason I realize in respect that you withdraw you guidance but some company have be able to offer either a framework or perhaps guardrail around the_second_quarter
just to help narrow the range of estimate on The Street perhaps provide some level setting for expectation without press you too hard on this be there any chance we could get you to do the same
yes
yes
we be not go to provide the formal guidance as we mention there but can talk a little bit about how we see the sequencing in we internal model
as mention in the prepared remark the_second_quarter be where we see the most significant revenue impact
that be also where we will have the highest sort of dollar value of savings
but it be just not the savings be take a little bit of time to get move here as we respond to the pandemic so that the margin impact for the_second_quarter will also be the largest impact
and then as we come into quarter 3 the revenue start to come back and the savings be fully bed in include some of the permanent savings we anticipate see margin tick up and be broadly in line with what we have see in prior year quarter 3
and then quarter be always every year we largest margin quarter and we do not expect there to be any different this_year from that perspective
so and that be where we will see the highest margin percentage
we next question or comment come from the line of David Windley from Jefferies
Hope everybody be well
one of the thing that I think stand out the most to I in some of you statistics here be you quantification of inaccessible site and that be a number that be quite a bit lower than you peer
so I want to understand more color around that both in term of kind of how you be define access
and then be you use do you think you be use site that be materially different than you peer
I will stop there
okay
Dave good to hear from you
I think there be a few element at play here
so we move very quickly early in the whole kind of pandemic start to move out of China and Asia
we move very quickly
and I think Paul and he team do a tremendous job of start to switch to remote monitoring the fact that we have the capability and the technology to do it the speed that we do it with and also the relationship we have with site
we have band on about site be a big part of we model and the relationship with site for a long time
and I think that help because we have that relationship
we have a good strong relationship with they
and I also think it be the therapy
so you have reference the type of site
I think it be drive by the therapy that we be work
so when we look at kind of the percentage of the essential treatment we work in and what I mean by that oncology rare disease orphan the really complex cns and gen med space inflammation immunology et_cetera we have a really big load really big kind of trial load in those really complicated space
and we be see those trial site stay engage stay monitor they patient very closely
we ability to plug into the electronic health record because we do it early and maybe get ahead of the pack a little bit when we do that because of that early move
I think all those thing combine help we stay in context keep the site engage and keep they move forward
I will flip you over to Paul for some of the definition around what we consider accessibility
the 10_% be just where we can not get anything out of the site
I will tell you that
but let I pass you over to Paul and Paul will give you a bit more detail on that site engagement from
so Paul
thanks
Dave yes I think it be a great question
and I think it come down to the definition as you think about what accessibility mean
and as Alistair say I do think we TA mix play a big part in that
but what we be see be that the site be still very active as well in try to engage in start-up activity
and so if you look at what we have see to-date just around regulatory submission we continue to work toward activation and we be still see a high percentage of we submission compare to prior year
so site be still want to engage in get ready for the next wave of study
they be still also engage in remote monitoring
we have see a number of site that where we can have access to remote access to ehr and can continue monitoring
we be still see site that be actively help we to ensure patient continuity and treatment and safety review
so we have not see much of a drop-off on that part
so I think it be just when you think about the definition of inaccessibility site especially in oncology and other area they be go to continue treatment of that patient
they want to continue the safety monitoring and we be able to do that across the site
so to clarify so 10_% be you can not get a CRA on site
you can not get remote access to the technology emr
you can not get anything
that be you kind of 10_% quantification
Correct
they be not allow any site activation
they be not do anything on regulatory submission
they just be inundate with the COVID at this point at that level
we be see the other 80 % 90 % that be still active in some form or fashion around continue the continuity of those study
okay
Understood
and then Jason probably for you a follow-up kind of a follow-up to Eric 's question
I just want to make sure give that maybe I be be too myopic here but give that you operational path seem a little clearer because you engagement with site be higher and that seem to be where COVID be the most disruptive
so you operational path seem a little clearer than you other than you peer but you be remove guidance and some of they have give 2q guidance as Eric comment
I just want to make sure that the and you first quarter be quite good
I just want to make sure that the kind of choice to not give guidance be not a reflection of a significant deterioration beyond March that be more precipitous
it do not sound like that be the case but I just want to make sure
well can I Jason can I just jump in front sorry
I think philosophically Dave on the guidance side I think we be well prepared operationally
we be plug in remotely right across the business and able to come back with site and we be already see some great optimism site start to reopen in Asia Pac and actually even into Europe and some in the U.S.
so we be see some optimism there as we reopen plan be go to look like and it be go to be down to local government that enable site to get back to full kind of full capability which enable we to get back to full on-site activity which obviously drive the revenue et_cetera
so it be like you say it be not because of a precipitous different overall that we be see compare to anybody else
it be just that we do not feel confident enough to pick that what that curve look like on the other side of this whether it be a v whether it be a U whether it be more like a check mark
I do not think anybody really know that yet
it be unprecedented
so it be more related to we how we feel about that philosophically than anything else
but Jason I just want to kind of add that think process
yes
yes
and Dave just to add
we do not we have not see anything precipitous in term of the falloff post quarter 1
I think Alistair hit the remark about pipeline and thing of that nature
and we talk about the operational metric there that have continue into the_second_quarter
we do have disruption
I mean that certainly be what we see
how that stack up to other and definition be hard
I think that top line and how that move through the_second_quarter and third quarter be the hard part from we perspective give the depth and duration I think what we focus more on be hey we can impact we cost base in a way that be temporary and/or permanent and we do control that and we want to do that quickly and go deeply early so that we can weather this as best we can early on and then tilt that back percentage-wise of the total cost base over the month and quarter
and that be what we plan to do while we also have more opportunity in front of we if we want to extend the temporary item or we can do more permanent item
so we be focus on what we could control and that be the cost side of thing
and that be what you see come through with the margin percentage that we want to get some guardrail on as Eric put it
we next question or comment come from the line of John Kreger from William Blair
I have question
Alistair can you maybe just comment on what sort of operational performance you be see
and how it might compare across the U.S. Europe and Asia particularly as you mention just a few minute ago some of the reopening that you be start to see
so that be the first question
and the second question be you give we some good stats about site accessibility
it sound like that be primarily relate to you ability to do monitoring
how about in term of patient ability to actually see they physician
and how be that part of the clinical trial process hold up
sure
so on the metric side John we we regular operational metric that we look at be drive actually from a activity basis site on a site level kind of on-site visit face-to-face time phone visit remote visit kind of the real-world evidence side of the business as well
so we track they very closely
we track they by therapeutic business unit
as you guy know we still run therapeutically
we track it by the fsp visit
so the whether that be in aggregate across we fsp business or by the actual customer business unit that sit within there
and then we have be look at how those have be ramp up and back down
so what we see obviously be a big drop-off in face-to-face visit
we still have face-to-face visit go_on
I think metric wise about 15 % of what we would normally expect to see be still active
and that be actually across all region so U.S. and Asia I think more so than Europe right_now
but we continue to track those
we have see a huge pickup obviously in the remote number because as we switch you get that transition in the line cross
and we be at good number on the remote monitoring visit side
like we say before we have get good site engagement still
we be still plug into the majority of we site still support they in what they need talk to they now about how do they return to work successfully and what we can do to help they and that kind of stuff
so there be a constant the support that it need
and obviously there be a lot of off-site time as well
on-site time be about 30 % of the overall
and then you have get tmf so you have get kind of writing of report and other associated activity that go along with those visit but actually kind of be not connect to be in actually engage with somebody on the site or actually on the site itself
second part of you question I think be more difficult for we to see in the metric about how many patient be go back on site
obviously a lot of we site be engage with patient directly from they home
so they be kind of remote to the patient as well because of social distance protocol
we have be work with site to make sure medication where applicable and where appropriate can be send to a patient
we have get if you think about the relationship we have put in place with AiCure we can actually watch the patient take they medication
that be what that system do
so and that be not plug in on all trial but it be on some of the cns trial et_cetera
so we can actually make sure that patient be compliant and that kind of thing
for those patient number I do not I be go to ask Paul but I do not think we have much metric around actual patient return to site yet
I know we be see it in Asia to a certain degree
and in some location in the U.S. we have see it be be a constant
but Paul I do not know if we track any metric like that
do we
I mean I think the easiest metric to look at would be just dropout and we have not see a lot of patient dropout from study
I think again it go back to you original comment Alistair on the TA mix
many of the condition we be treat patient need to have that continuity of therapy
and so they be go to continue that therapy
but I think the biggest indicator be on dropout and we have not see a spike in patient dropout from study
we do monitor that
and we be continue obviously to measure as you say the live visit
we actually see a spike a increase in the last 2 week around live visit
we be as you say between the 10_% and 15 % range on what visit and submission continue to go up
so I think those be the biggest indicator that those site be still active and patient be still active on study
we next question or comment come from the line of Erin Wright from Crédit Suisse
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division line generally speak for as a cro or a solution provider in this industry
do you anticipate that be a meaningful offsetting factor for you
and have you I assume you be have those conversation as we speak as well with sponsor
yes
thanks Erin
I think it be a natural part of this right
so the impact of COVID be go to elongate trial in general term
you be go to see a reduction
the statistics be not go to change
the power of these trial be not go to change
so we be still go to need patient for a 500-patient trial but it be go to take we longer to get to they
so that extend let 's say it be a 6-month kind of elongation of trial
that be go to expand project management time duration thing unit that be drive by duration
and that be go to those thing be go to get pass through to customer in some regard which will move that revenue do not go away
it just move to the right
like you say it will drive change order activity and it will move that revenue to right effectively
so we think we see that those activity move along now
there be also the shift to remote monitoring
there be some change to the cost structure for that
and we be not the EMA issue guidance on what they think about remote monitoring the change around COVID the day before yesterday
so we be still evaluate those regulatory comment et_cetera and the impact
so you be go to see a reduction if you like in the cost of monitor visit as it move from on-site to remote take out the travel time there be you can not do everything that you could have do on site so you be probably go to get 70 % of the revenue for that
but then that be go to offset to some degree by the increase in project duration
okay great
and then a broader question here
do you think some of this covid disruption should drive any sort of stepped-up industry consolidation across the cro
do you think that there be opportunity there from a consolidation standpoint
it be a good question
it be a question I have not give much thought to to be below we
we have be occupy in other way recently obviously
I do not know if this will be a individual driver of more consolidation
I think if the CRO maybe some of the smaller one without a liquidity it have problem
I do not know maybe they become target for consolidation I do not know
but I do not think of the higher echelon of the business it will drive consolidation meaningfully from what be out there already
we next question or comment come from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan
Alistair you mention recruiting patient from less affected area
I be just curious how successful that strategy have be in this environment
and be there other action you be take to increase start-up time from like a patient recruitment standpoint
Tycho I think early before the pandemic spread much wider yes we have some good success with divert recruitment to other location
we be still have some success with that
we have I do not think there be much out there that you can do right_now to increase or enhance patient enrollment because you have the other factor the patient 's fear of go into a center if that be require as part of the recruitment
I will ask Paul if he be get any thought
I will come to Paul in a second if he be get any thought on that
but I do not think that we be see much that be really accelerate a trial at the moment unless it be covid-19 trial obviously which we have a few of those go
Paul any thought on that
yes Tycho it be a good question
we I think at this point it be global enough that there be not place you really can go to find a offset from that perspective
I do think that again the mix of therapeutic area we have patient still be go to want to join therapy
I would also say that some of we larger partner be also look at action plan to start open enrollment
remember part of enrollment dropoff be a decision by some of the larger client base
but I think they be reevaluate that
and I think that will be helpful as you look at enrollment as well
site be still actively want to have enrollment in many therapeutic area
so I think we will start to see that over time improve just because of the decision from the client base
and then a follow-up on the question earlier on change order cost
I appreciate you think it will be push out to the right
but be you view that you will be able to pass on most of the incremental cost
and then as we think about kind of mid trial protocol change how seamless will those discussion I guess be with the sponsor
or how much friction could there be in term of go back and have to redo work
and be it generally understand what the FDA be go to require to the extent that work need to go back and be redone
well again I will ask Paul for he comment as he be closer to that than I
but I do think that this pandemic post send all of we customer in the same situation
so we be not go back to customer to try and explain change order that they do not really understand what happen
it be always a driver for get into a argument with a customer on a change order
so I think the customer be very clear at the moment
I think we have have more engagement with customer than we even normally do and we be a heavily engage organization when it come to the customer front
so we have have deep discussion we have get detailed discussion around the impact
like I say before we be still the MA release its guidance on what I expect to see from remote monitoring and this situation only 2 day ago
so we be evaluate that still and how that will guide conversation around change order
but I think we customer certainly understand either through the trial they be run themselves or through as in other cro that this pandemic post in that change in the trial which will lead to a change order
it be even on fix price trial where we have what we would call a material change addendum this will qualify under that
it be something that be outside completely outside of we control and expectation for trial that be up and run
so yes I think those conversation will take place
there be we be already lay some of that out for customer and the expectation around that
but right_now the focus really have be on how do we contain how do we get the site move over to remote how do we manage the patient load how do we manage to keep these trial compliant keep the patient compliant et_cetera
and now we be move on to what the financial impact of move to a remote stance and the elongation of trial
and of course customer will only want to do that once they know the full impact of the change
so how long be we go to be remote how long be we go to be delay et_cetera which so you can give they the whole packet in one go
so we be look at that go through those discussion
Paul idea
I mean if I can add to that I think what we have really also do be the amount of proactive communication that we have put out from we communication team
we have create lens for we client to view what the action be that we be take
and to be very honest I have a lot of interaction with we client
I have never be prouder to be a part of this industry because I think every single client that I have speak to they first messaging be patient safety continuity of this trial and the therapy for the patient
so we have be very transparent about that
and I think we be see a real partnership with most of we client where they want to see that patient safety and continuity
and we be all do the right thing to keep these trial go
so I do think we will be able as we work through this together to find the right solution and make sure we be do the right thing to keep continuity for patient
I do not anticipate that be a huge headwind
yes
okay
and if I could ask just one more just on commercial
how do you think about the recovery there
and obviously the margin hit be significant on that side
be there any cost save bias towards that side of the business or be that not the right way to think about it
well Michelle be on the phone so we can talk about that with Michelle as well
but the cost savings we have look at Tycho corporately across the business
I think what we be see on the commercial side be again a good a quick and enable switch to remote and engagement with hcp across that business
so Michelle any comment on that
sure
so a couple of thing
first as Alistair talk about we Deployment Solutions business quickly move to remote engagement with customer and because of the capability that we have invest in in omnichannel
and frankly we expertise from we engagement center of access customer over the phone or over the web or on video as well as we Learning Solutions team
we basically take that learning and those capability and teach they to we field representative which sound like a little thing but be actually a very big thing really understand how to navigate a office with empathy through difficult time
so the field representative do really really well and be already back to pre-covid call activity through virtual channel right
so I think that that be really important
I think the other thing that we have see in regard to the pipeline which be encouraging be we be just see delay in decision
we be not see any customer pull we fee back or say that they be not go to continue to focus on the area that they have be focus on
so most of the issue have be push in decision from a pipeline perspective so that be why the pipeline be look strong
so in regard to comm and consulting those business work very effectively remotely
we have do multiple virtual pitch
we be win business virtually
and so that business have be operate pretty successfully in a remote environment as well
so we be ready to go when we can get back into office and back in to customer but we interaction remotely have meet pre-covid level
so we be confident we have what we need to be successful throughout this delay but then to be able to quickly get back into drive revenue and drive we there
yes
and then Tycho this be Jason here
just to finish that off
on the margin side as Michelle and Alistair both hit Alistair a little bit in the prepared remark
but we start see the delay there at the close to the end of the quarter particularly on we field team side and thing of that nature that do roll the net revenue come down some and therefore the margin do take a hit
I would say though when you look at we internal plan we be only down about point
because in prior year we have some favorable revenue mix item that pump the margin up
so that be historically one of the lower this be we lower margin quarter
so just to give a little color there in term of the mix and then how that compare to we internal plan
we next question or comment come from the line of Sandy Draper from SunTrust
a lot of my question have be ask and answer
maybe and this be probably more for Jason
you be operate very differently today when you as the CFO start to look across the operation be there area where you say yes we want to get back to normal clearly but these be thing we actually be realize we do not have to do any more
these be expense we do not have to spend
and I be think obviously you guy be do a bunch of cost savings plan and get synergy and have ongoing initiative
but be there material new area you be uncover from this unfortunate circumstance that you be say hey go forward over the long term these be identifiable cost savings area that we have not necessarily consider or contemplate before
Sandy , it be Alistair
just I think this whole environment this whole issue really be a driver for we to evaluate more than just cost savings
we be look at we have a strategic plan a strategic planning cycle that we run on a 3-year basis that we be in the middle of right_now
and we be look at what be we learn from this activity people work from home
I mean the efficiency of people work from home have be astounding right
people have everybody be at home everybody be do it so that work
what do that mean for we strategically from a office footprint location footprint perspective
we have invest wisely over the last few year I think to make sure everybody in the organization I the infrastructure to enable that as well
so we be learn a lot of thing from this experience that we be use as import to challenge current strategy what it will mean to we strategy in the_future what it will mean in term of customer change
we be lobby and question customer about they thought on it
so I think it be a bigger issue than just cost savings
they be capture in that but also it be really strategically how do you think about this
what other activity will this drive
how will it change the business that we work in and the way that the business operate on top of that
so we be really use this challenge as a opportunity to think harder about where we go in the_future in general term
but Jason question on the cost side what do you any difference in the way that we think on that
I would just I mean yes I think Alistair be right obviously
I would add we be accelerate some of the thing that we already see Sandy and forward-bound pull that forward and those be permanent type item
and then the other thing that we hit on that we have not talk about and it be nothing huge but we do take the opportunity to look at the portfolio of service right across the business what might not be as core as perhaps it once be or thing of that nature that we think will obviously help we longer term as we focus on the business and help we margin-wise too as we come out on the other side
we next question or comment come from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore
I just have a question in term of how you be think or how you conversation have be go with sponsor around virtual trial
be people sort of receptive to that idea
or I mean be that more of like a receptive in principle versus willing to implement now
be there certain segment of you client base that have be more interested
any detail you could provide there would be helpful
okay
so I want to make sure that definitionally we be all talk about the same thing because what we always be a element of monitoring well certainly over the last few year risk-based monitoring or efficiency base monitoring however you want to look at it
virtual trial be something completely different right
where there be a virtual trial be where there be no investigator
we refer to they as decentralized trial
so they be a different kind of subset of trial
so decentralize kind of easier to administer the medicine easier to do it but through telehealth really suit kind of more chronic disease where the patient 's self do they own medication at they own set of home and maybe in a real world setting
so we already run virtual trial in that sense
now the remote side be we be not go on to site but the patient be still be treat by a investigative site
and I think there be be a little bit of confusion around those to the interchangeability if you like of the word virtual and decentralized and remote
so we be see receptibility at the moment from customer to go to remote trial to remote monitoring trial during this pandemic
and the guidance come out from regulator be kind of work around that as well what they expect to see on the virtual trial and we already have that capability
we deliver those in more real-world setting and less complex medicine
so it be not really a customer by customer
I think all customer be interested in virtual trial and what they can bring to they
it be more about the applicability of they by therapy and by phase of the therapy rather than customer themselves
so it be kind of a definitional thing and I think people will interchange virtual and get virtual and remote mix together where they be actually separate thing
yes that be helpful
and so just to absolutely clarify so you have not see like and none of you trial be convert from either in-person or remote to something on the virtual because that would just sort of be from you the way you be position it be like a whole separate construct that would require a different protocol and so
yes
essentially yes
I mean Paul any additional thought on that
what you can do the remote and the on-site together virtual be like you say something different in term of its overall construct
no I mean the only thing I would add Alistair I think you be spot on which be every trial be really a customize solution
it really depend on the TA you be work in
we be do telemedicine on a number of trial
we have we be use client system in some instance
we have multiple model that we be put in place
but when you think about telemedicine in a lot of the ta we work in you be not do a ct scan or a infusion typically that way
so I think we be customize those fit for the specific client need but we be work across all of the above and have partner that be help we from a telemedicine perspective to do that
we next question or comment come from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS
so I just want to ask one kind of clarification
it be come up a few time even in the last question
so in term of the percentage of cra that can get to site I think Alistair Jason you mention 15 %
be that correct
in term I be just try to level set kind of back to a few question kind of what some of you peer have talk about which be how I think they be define it but I be just try to clarify
so 15 % of so basically 85 % of site be inaccessible for cra physically be there
get it
and any sense of how that change if you look out over the course of the_year give you various planning strategy
you have get probably a good plan and a bad plan
but when you think about the middle plan like what would that look like as you get to q3 q4
well I think what we expect as we say earlier be the biggest impact throughout q2
I think it be go to depend on local government protocol
and as they peel back the social distancing requirement what that look like in q3 but we expect it to be a big increase and then big improvement as we go through q3
not only as kind of COVID hopefully blow itself out or the social distancing measure take effect
but as we learn what the best routine be for a site to protect themselves and the staff what the cleaning protocol be et_cetera we be help site with that
and then by q4 I be hope that we will see a heavily reduce impact and be back to a majority of on-site work
I think some of the trial may stay as a mix of on-site and remote as well
so you can cut the number of visit down and they can cut they exposure down by continue to do remote a little bit longer
so I really do not have a crystal ball that tell we when we be go to be out of it and what that be go to do to overall visit
we have trend line like you say we have a good scenario and a downside scenario or and it all relate on how quickly it peel back
but expect to see which I think be the same as everybody else 's
but in term of local site 's ability to allow monitor back on site that be go to be a case-by-case side-by-side basis
Great
and then you make some comment in the prepared remark and then in subsequent q&a it be come up
but in term of the ability to recapture what be lose here early on in the_year be the idea that it do just get push out
or be there slack in the system
obviously patient and site and people it be hard to kind of accelerate thing
but I be just wonder how do we think about over the course of this_year and then even in the next year be there the ability to kind of accelerate some of the shift here kind a get to a point where you have catch up
I think the catch-up will take several quarter
I do not think it be I think if q2 and q3 be down you do not get the change order all in place and you do not recoup all that you do not get rid of the backlog at site and thing like that in q4
so I think it will overall be a impact to the whole of from a operational and then revenue perspective
and then as we go through if there be no second wave if there be no kind of reverberation of this around the world as the second wave then I think we will largely be catch up with trial through some point in whether that be the middle to the end I do not know
but it do not all come back in the first week that we get back to work
it be a much more phased and gradual piece of that
because site only have a certain capacity for patient even if there be a big backlog of patient
when those site reopen there be go to be a prioritization of which monitor can go back out in site
because we all a lot of we use similar site
so they be not go to want dra show up on day it be go to be a phasing
so it will take a while to catch back up
we next question or comment come from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs
this be Jack Rogoff on for Bob
so I be try to understand the range of outcome embed in the 13 % to 14 % margin range
I guess we have make meaningful progress in regain physical access to site by the_fourth_quarter
and if commercial decision be still delay in the_fourth_quarter would you still be able to maintain the range
yes
Jack , it be Jason here
yes
so we as I mention a little bit earlier Jack we have go on the cost side heavier on the front end with temporary and permanent item
and we have a certain percentage of the cost base that we be target in quarter 3 and quarter
and I be sorry quarter 2 , quarter 3 and quarter
and then on top of that we have get about 50_% more identify that we could pull in if we need to by extend item or add more permanent item
so with that level of visibility and what be in front of we the range we feel confident in get in that range base on the range of outcome we have look at in we internal model via those item
get it
that be helpful
and then just follow up on the complex disease area that you talk about have high exposure to
I be curious what the split be for you between hospital-based site and outpatient site for the trial that you be run
that be a good question Paul
I do not know if I have get the stats at hand
we can see -lsb- indiscernible -rsb-
but I think give we pipeline and what we have therapeutically I would say likely that it will have a lot more hospital base
but I have to go back and cut it
I have not cut it that way
I will catch up with that
we next question or comment come from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research
so first I want to ask about you effort to add incremental preferred provider relationship with large pharma
obviously we be all work remote right_now
it be hard to say how quickly thing will sort of get back to normal
so for the company that you would have expect to be able to pitch this_year I guess how be they handle they process
be they push out they own decision-making
or be they extend they current provider on a short-term basis extend they for something more like a full contract pool
I would love to get a better sense of what you be hear on this
and then just as my second question just think about headcount
I guess how do you think you year-end headcount will compare to where it would have be if we never have the outbreak
okay
so I think some of those large pharma processor we have see they continue to run and we be actively engage with they
it be a bit different obviously not be able to press the flesh but we be do the virtual press of flesh and continue to move those process forward
I think it will take a bit longer
they might have do it if we be able to get face-to-face but we be not
we do not have any concern that those thing be not progress as we expect they to
so and then in overall headcount we have get hire freeze on at the moment same as everybody else
that really look at billable sorry nonbillable and then look at on the billable side we be always go to be interested in talent
we be always go to be look for talent
we have be build a significant backlog
we have have great growth
we be go to need to continue fuel that with talent as we move forward
but we be obviously be very cautious and make sure that we keep the cost side of the business under control while revenue 's suppress a little bit
so I think we will probably come out of the_year with roughly what we have get now but it depend on how quickly it all come back
I mean if we see a strong solid resilient rebound in q3 and we need to get the staff in for q4 we will be do that and we will be at a higher number
so but it just again depend on that the shape of that curve
we next question or comment come from the line of Donald Hooker from KeyBanc
Great
obviously this have go_on for a while so a lot of my question have be ask and answer
one area maybe sort of as a side question or half the floor
I have be interested in the_past in you you have a medication adherence datum business which I think would be a pretty timely asset right_now of be able to sort of digitally connect with pharmacy and whatnot
I think you pick that up as part of inVentiv Health
there have be some hiccup in that business a few quarter back
have those hiccup the revenue headwind there kind of reverse
and maybe just in a briefly what be the state of that particular business unit
yes
I will pass it over to Michelle for the detail
I mean some of those historic hiccup be on the customer side where I think they have a data breach or something like that which shut one of the big program down
so we be kind of on the receive end of that one
but like you say I think there be a lot of effort go into tracking and trace and datum at the moment
so it be a interesting business right_now
Michelle
sure
and I will let Jason chime in if I miss anything
so it be a headwind in as you recall for a variety of reason many of which Alistair already discuss
back on track this_year versus budget
and we be actually find a lot of interest as you can imagine if you look at the datum around trx on chronic care medication oral medication
through the end of March we see that actually those be the prescription that be hold up pretty well
and we be get a lot of datum from those pharmacy
CEO Director around the importance of keep people on medication right_now right
I mean when you think about telehealth and the fact that a lot of patient be choose to communicate with they customer over video versus in-person in certain geography the importance of keep patient on medication right_now especially in chronic disease be critically important
and we be see a lot of interest from we customer in discussion around how do we continue to do that
because you do not want the next wave of health crisis to be that
once we get beyond covid-19 patient who be chronically take chronic medication be now well we lose they medication and then we have new issue right base on they not be compliant
so absolutely be very valuable through this time
and Jason I do not know if you want to add anything on the financial
just to say year-over-year it be still as we outline it be still a drag in term of performance year-over year
but as Michelle allude to we be quite pleased with how we performing in quarter relative to we budget
we next question or comment come from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi
Alistair maybe one just on the virtual trial side you have talk about a decent amount on the call here
in you conversation with customer do you feel like there could be a inflection point here where you see a bigger shift towards the virtual trial model on the other side of COVID
and then if so what be you guy position there relative to peer to capture some share
yes
yes I think it be a really good question
I think that go back to what have we learn from COVID
so we have be stick in this gradual move over to risk-based monitoring and the part of that that require remote monitoring instead of face-to-face
the real kind of handbrake on that have be the clarity from the regulator
I be Chairman of ACRO this_year as well and with Cyndi Verst and Steve Collins help and the rest of the team what we have be try to do be make sure that there be a linkage between what the regulator ask for and we ability to execute it operationally across the industry
so pharma cro and regulator work together on a operational solution that be doable
the handbrake on it have be a little bit more than anything else be the lack of clarity
when the regulator say adequate monitoring what do adequate mean
how do that relate to remote versus on site et_cetera et_cetera
so as we get suggestion and the solution that we roll out which could be remote or virtual trial et_cetera
and I think that be the push
this be part of the push that that process be need
so I be optimistic that we will see more of a shift to more remote monitoring
I think the quality be just as good
I think it help drive the cost down a little bit
you get higher throughput from people because they be just not on plane travel you get that utilization of
in term of where we sit for remote I think Paul 's comment speak for themselves in the fact that we be able to shift to remote pretty quickly
and then on the virtual side we use we dynamic assembly model for that
we be able to plug any datum into any system
we have run several virtual trial with different system different platform
they do not all fit exactly what you would each platform in and of itself be not the solution to every problem that come through or every challenge the customer come with which be why we like to have optionality around the different system and the different platform we deploy
so I think we be very well position
we will be at the front of that
if we be not in the front of it already we will be very much at the front of it in term of partner with those organization
and there be several of they out there
it be like 15 year ago when EDC take off right
you have different option and about of they work
that be the virtual trial space at the moment as well
okay that be helpful
and then a quick one for Jason
I know you have talk about the commercial side a decent amount here on the margin
I tend to think of that as a lot heavier on the variable cost side
can you just talk through the cost structure
if revenue do pull back significantly how nimble can you be specifically in that segment on the cost side
yes Patrick
yes
so the business be similar in term of the variable versus fix on the cost of sale
commercial be probably 95 % and the cost of sale be variable
and on the SG&A side give the profile of that with the rep and most of the headcount be out and some on customer system and sop among ours the SG&A load there be pretty favorable too from that perspective
so I feel pretty good and the business do a good job of adjust that as need
management for any closing remark
thank you
well thanks everybody and a sincere thanks also go to the entire Syneos Health team for all they have do and all they be do in the face of these unprecedented condition

good morning and thanks for that kind introduction
I truly appreciate the time you have spend help I get up to speed quickly thank you
I be Tim Sawyer the new President and CEO of
Teligent
I be delighted to be here with you this_morning to discuss the q4 and full year result for Teligent
it be be 5 month since Teligent 's last call with investor so needless to say Damian and I have a lot of topic to cover this_morning
I would like to start by thank the Teligent employee Board of director and the many stakeholder include shareholder creditor customer and vendor for they warm welcome thank you
I look forward to work with you as we drive Teligent 's business forward
during my first 8 week with Teligent I have be very clear with all of these stakeholder about my top priority
first resolve the Warning Letter issue by the FDA in November of 2019
second pass the pre-approval inspection of we new injectable manufacturing facility in Buena New Jersey
and third manage cash_flow
before walk you through these priority in more detail I would also like to highlight that I believe in the company 's TICO , topical , injectable , complex and ophthalmic strategy my plan be ground on efficiently execute this strategy not fundamentally change it
I have work in the pharmaceutical industry for nearly 30 year
I have see strategy company people and product come and go
but regardless of the ever-shifting headwind this industry have face for decade the company that succeed know how to execute
and to execute you need to build a organization hyper-focused on deliver a uninterrupted supply of high-quality low-cost pharmaceutical product to its customer
my plan be to execute the TICO strategy not change it
let 's talk about we first priority resolve the FDA Warning Letter
there be phase to the Warning Letter remediation
phase be a physical audit of we facility conduct by a third-party auditor
this phase be intend to show that the current process procedure and policy of the company be compliant for pharmaceutical product
this phase have be complete and the report be submit to the FDA
phase ii be the documentation audit and review
this ensure that all product on the market that be within expiry be verify as safe effective and fit for use
this phase be nearly complete and we expect to file we final response to the agency in the coming day
although ultimately only the FDA can decide to lift a warning letter I feel confident in the company 's remediation effort lead by we enhance quality team
regard the second priority pass the pre-approval inspection we engage the third-party auditor previously mention to conduct a mock audit of we prior approval supplement application and the Buena facility which include the new sterile facility
at the conclusion of the audit we review the finding and we quality and operational team have work diligently to address they observation
we believe we be prepare for the FDA inspection
we original intent be to use we ranitidine product to trigger this pai
however in light of the FDA action on ranitidine last week include request the market withdrawal of all ranitidine product this be unlikely and we will shift to we next injectable product to trigger the PAI
this product be expect to be file shortly after the Warning Letter be submit in the coming day
again although it be ultimately up to the agency to decide we preference and intent be to work with the FDA to perform a combined inspection in Buena that cover both what be necessary to lift the warning
letter and approve we sterile facility for commercial production
manage cash_flow have be and will continue to be a priority under my leadership
the organization be successful in reduce discretionary spending and redeploy the savings to fund more investment in we quality department previously
cost savings however be a integral part of a generic company and we will continue to focus on savings that impact we cost of goods to enable Teligent to remain cost competitive in the marketplace
another area of focus have be on the company 's capital structure
as you will hear from Damian he have lead the team in retire issue and swap convertible bond in addition to execute amendment on we revolve credit facility and term loan with Ares Capital
effort to reduce cost will continue and the capital structure will continue to evolve
we also continue to work with we development partner and the FDA to address the second complete response letter receive on we complex drug application
and finally we continue to work with Leerink on the noncore asset divestiture process initiate in October of 2019
we be progress and we will provide update as appropriate
at this point let I turn the call over to Damian so he can provide more insight to we actual and project financial performance and a few other important topic
at the conclusion of Damian 's remark I will share some final thought before open it up to you question
Damian
thanks Tim
we last earnings call be in November of 2019
so I would like to spend a few more minute than usual in order to provide you with a full update on important topic
number one actual and project financial performance number two key highlight to the Ares loan amendment announce earlier today three liquidity and finally four we listing status with NASDAQ
so let 's start with the first topic actual and project financial performance
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 be $ 16.7 million bring full year revenue to $ 65.9 million or 4 % short of we last full year guidance
fourth quarter revenue be dampen by failure to supply fee of $ 0.8 million $ 0.4 million of which be incur in Canada
and although difficult to quantify it be reasonable to assume that past supply disruption couple with the noncore asset divestiture process initiate on October 1 and the Warning Letter issue by the FDA in late November 2019 combine to dampen demand for we product
as we work through these challenge effort to smooth the ongoing process of balance supply and demand will be further emphasize
and with Tim 's experience and leadership in this area I remain confident that we will get there absent any covid-19-related business interruption
Gross margin for the_fourth_quarter be 12 % a basis point decline from the 43 % realize as of year-to-date September 30 , 2019
unfavorable customer and product mix account for of those basis_point decline in the_fourth_quarter
price erosion account for another basis_point while incremental inventory reserve account for the remain portion of the quarter-on-quarter decline
fourth quarter total operating expense be consistent with previously report September 30 year-to date result
specific to product development and research expense the incremental expense realize in the_fourth_quarter be drive by a $ 0.9 million noncash write-off of a prepaid asset relate to a delay tep transfer between of we injectable contract manufacturer
specific to sell general and administrative expense we continue to incur legal fee as we vigorously defend we position in ongoing litigation
however for a company of we size legal fee of $ 1 million in the_fourth_quarter and $ 3.7 million for full year 2019 be material
as report in today 's press_release adjust EBITDA for the_fourth_quarter be a loss of $ 4.3 million
that say consistent with what I describe earlier this loss include the $ 0.8 million of failure to supply penalty record as a offset to revenue the $ 0.9 million write-off record in product development and research expense and the continue legal defense cost
in term of full year performance the company post $ 65.9 million of revenue which be consistent with
despite the less than expect performance in the fourth quarter of 2019 year-on-year gross profit improve by $ 0.7 million or 3 % while gross margin improve basis_point from 34 % to 36 %
fourth quarter financial performance lead to a shortfall in we goal of forge the path to profitability in as we post adjust EBITDA equivalent to a $ 0.2 million loss for the full year
we file for a 10-k extension on Monday , March 30
the extension provide we with a incremental 15 day
additional time be need to execute the loan amendment with are and as a result and require subsequent event disclosure to form 10-k
we intend to file by the end of this week but certainly before the extended deadline of April 14
lastly in term of project financial performance we will not be provide financial guidance on today 's call
there be several major variable weigh on we ability to accurately project and deliver we financial target
aside from the impact covid-19 might have on we manufacturing capability and or patient demand for we product Teligent be also operate under a warning letter
as a consequence of that warning letter we file topical anda will not be approve and the injectable pre-approval inspection will happen either in parallel or after warn letter resolution
variable such as covid-19 a Warning Letter pre-approval inspection complex drug application and the noncore asset divestiture process be material and not entirely within we control
for all of these reason we will not be provide guidance today
however we do anticipate report a approximate 50_% decline in first quarter 2020 revenue
look beyond the first quarter of 2020 assume successful resolution of the material event mention we would expect to see financial performance improvement over the remainder of the calendar year
this lead I to the second of the topic I would like to cover and that be provide key highlight to the loan amendment announce earlier today
both we actual financial performance and medium-term projection be review and discuss in detail with we secure creditor Ares Capital
as a outcome of those collaborative discussion we execute amendment to both we first lien revolver and second lien term loan agreement on April 6 , 2020
these amendment serve to eliminate the original fourth quarter financial covenant while significantly reduce the financial performance require to meet financial covenant go forward
for the 4 quarter of 2020 the company must record trail 12-month net revenue of $ 59 million $ 55 million $ 54 million and $ 57 million respectively
begin with the_quarter end March 31 , 2021 the company must report trail 12-month adjusted ebitda performance in excess of a range begin with $ 10 million increase to $ 14.5 million for the last quarter just prior to loan maturity
also the calculation of adjust EBITDA per the amendment now include certain add-back include but not limit to legal expense within certain limitation
in addition the amendment provide the company with the option to continue pick or defer cash interest pay on the term loan for a additional year if the company be successful in resolve the Warning Letter and pass the injectable pre approval inspection by December 2020
if only one of those item occur by this time then the company may still elect to pay interest in kind during but only from the time the second condition have be satisfy
beyond December 2021 a portion of interest on the loan accrue at a rate of 4.25 % per annum may continue to be pay in kind
although we preference be to generate the operating cash flow need to service we debt to avoid the compounding effect of pick interest this provision improve the company 's ability to maintain the liquidity need to execute we strategy
in consideration of the relax covenant and potential to extend the pick option the cost of capital increase
the amend interest rate on the first lien revolve credit facility be LIBOR plus 5.5 % with a 1.5 % LIBOR floor
the new rate be about basis_point more than at loan inception in December 2018 or basis_point more than the rate just prior to execute the amendment
the difference between the increment at loan inception versus today relate to the 15-month decline in the LIBOR
the amend interest rate on the second lien term loan be LIBOR plus 13 % also with the 1.5 % LIBOR floor
the new rate be about basis_point more than at loan inception or basis_point more than the rate just prior to execute the amendment
again the difference between the incremental loan inception versus today relate to the 15-month decline in LIBOR
lastly Ares be grant approximately 5.4 million warrant at the cost of $ 0.01 per warrant equivalent to just under 10_% of the outstanding share of the company at December 31 , 2019
more detail on these loan amendment will be make available to the public when we file form 8-k after market close today
go forward by resolve the Warning Letter pass the pre-approval inspection and consistently achieve positive financial result covid-19 aside we credit profile should improve and we will be in a better position to work with Ares Capital we exist bondholder and potentially new creditor to address we capital structure and thus reduce we cost of capital
have review the key highlight of the loan amendment let 's move to topic and we liquidity
as you hear Tim mention in he open remark one of we top priority be to manage cash_flow and I will add particularly in the second quarter of 2020
give the impact covid-19 might have on we business and less anticipated cash collection from customer as a consequence of the decline in first quarter 2020 revenue available cash balance will decline over the course of this_quarter
we issue Series B Bank 2023 convertible bond in the fourth quarter of 2019
we use $ 29.3 million of gross proceeds from those bond plus a final $ 10 million draw from we term loan with are to cover fee associate with the capital raise pay down current liability retire $ 13.1 million of December 2019 convertible bond and provide the company with further liquidity
with the increase in current asset and decline in current liability associate with this bond issuance and term loan draw work capital at December 31 , 2019 increase to $ 45 million
this represent a $ 28.4 million improvement in work capital from what we report at September 30 , 2019
more specifically we end the_year with $ 15.5 million of cash on the balance_sheet
in order to preserve cash we will continue to pick or defer cash interest payment on we series b may 2023 convertible bond and the term loan with are
keep in mind the company now have the potential to extend this option for another year if we be able to resolve the Warning Letter and pass pre-approval inspection by December 2020
we continue to pay regular interest on we Ares revolve credit facility as well as we series a May 2023 convertible bond
with the loan amendment announce today Teligent 's quarterly cash interest payable to Ares will increase by about $ 150,000
this increase relate solely to the estimate basis point increase on the revolving credit facility
and we next semiannual interest payment to bondholder be $ 1.6 million and be payable in May 2020
lastly we like many other company with less than employee be explore and have apply for covid-19 relief make available by recently pass state and federal legislation in the form of payroll related reimbursement and low-cost small business association loan
allow I to switch gear to the last topic we NASDAQ listing status and potential for a reverse split of we common stock
in June 2019 we receive a delisting notice from NASDAQ due to we share price trading below $ 1 for consecutive trading day
the notice specify that we share price must trade above $ 1 per share for consecutive trading day prior to December 2 , 2019 in order to prevent we common stock from be delist
on December 2 , 2019 we have yet to regain compliance
we request a second 100-day 180-day extension NASDAQ deny we request and the company choose to file for a appeal
the company be grant a hearing date for the end of January 2020
subsequent to the appeal hearing shareholder approve a reverse stock split in the range of any whole number range from and to and soon after we be inform by NASDAQ that we appeal be deny
in light of the covid-19 impact on the market NASDAQ set a deadline to regain compliance of June 1 , 2020
although possible it be not probable that business performance alone particularly as we navigate through covid-19 related challenge will be the catalyst to increase the share price above $ 1
if we share be delist from the NASDAQ we would be in default of the nonfinancial covenant require by we senior credit facility and convertible bond and we would need to seek a waiver or seek new capital thus leave a reverse stock split as the only remain option to prevent this occurrence
while we believe that the reverse stock split will ultimately increase we share price above $ 1 for the require consecutive trading day we can provide no assurance this will be the case
with that let I now turn the call back over to Tim for he final remark before we move to the question and-answer portion of today 's call
Tim
thanks Damian
I can confirm my first 2 month here at Teligent have be exciting
as Damian and I highlight the company have some headwind
however the untapped potential of this company be evident and I be thrill to be here and confident that I have the management team and employee base need to execute efficiently to achieve we objective
we hope that you and you family be safe and in good health
we team here at Teligent particularly those on-site working in Buena inspire I every day
they dedication commitment and loyalty to both this company and we customer and patient be admirable
during this pandemic we have take many extra step to protect we employee and I be glad to report that no teligent employee have test positive for covid-19
Manufacturing in Buena and distribution from we third-party logistics provider have be thankfully uninterrupted
we be recognize as a essential business in each municipality and country where we be located
and as such we be operate as normal
we continue to closely monitor we supply_chain to ensure we have the material necessary to produce we product
to date we have not experience any significant delay in production thanks to the commitment of we operator
we be proud to have a U.S. manufacturing facility for we product
we look forward to utilize its expand capacity upon approval from the FDA
with that I will now ask Daniel to open up the call to question
thank you
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group
Tim welcome
nice to hear from you this_morning
I have get a few question
maybe the first that you could start with be what attract you to this opportunity
where do you see the near-term low-hanging fruit
and how quickly do you think you can capitalize on that
thanks
so I think a couple of thing
first what attract I to the opportunity obviously you hear a bunch about headwind and thing today but what attract I to the opportunity specifically be the product portfolio and the injectable transition that the company have be under that be undergo at the time that I join
I think injectable be a critical component to the medical treatment protocol
I think that they be a area where there be lot of opportunity particularly as you have see in the marketplace with drug shortage if you track that area
so I think that be very very interesting to I
and I think that the ability of this company to launch into that market be really exciting
so that be the first part
the second part what do I see as low-hanging fruit
I think the first thing that we do and be do be improve we product supply
so one of the thing that this company be burden with previously be they be unable to be a reliable supplier for customer
and customer demand that in this marketplace not be a intermittent supplier and that cause lump in you sale lump in you earnings
and so we have undertake a comprehensive plan to overhaul we supply_chain and we process for how we work and forecast and predict we business go forward
so that be the first thing be to become a reliable supplier for we customer and that will pay off in dividend when we customer see we as such and be able to rely on we day in and day out when we become they first tier call when they be look for new product
so I think that be a area of low-hanging fruit for we
and I think I might have forget what you third part of you question be
no
that be perfect
you touch on one of the thing
so as you look at get the injectable facility up and approve by the FDA one of the opportunity with the first drug that be submit be that it be the or to trigger the inspection be that you plan with that second submission be to find a opportunity where it be a drug that either be currently on shortage or have the history of be on shortage
or maybe even there be a opportunity within something within the coronavirus treatment where there be a need and a demand that would trigger the FDA to maybe come in sooner rather than later
yes
so good question
so what we be look at the second product obviously will be file here shortly
it do not have a shortage currently
however as a part of a nda and it be a pre-approval supplement as I mention what be go what will happen be there be a statutory time line that the FDA have to come in and inspect for so because they have to respond to the agent to the supplement within certain number of month
so number one this product allow we to push a faster track on that
number two we be always and what you mention be important we be always look for opportunity to accelerate the time line
and if there be covid-19 related way to do that we will pursue they rigorously to work with the agency to get to accelerate that approval for the facility
okay
and then and I do not know if you know the answer to this but I think I would ask it anyway
give the situation with the country right_now be there be you hear anecdotally any issue with the FDA conduct inspection
I know that they be consider obviously a essential business and they be still go to work
but be that slow down the inspection process in any way that you have hear
they have make a couple of announcement at the agency about delay inspection of certain particular type
we believe that quite frankly we believe that with what be go_on with this pandemic the fact that we be a U.S. manufacturing facility located in New Jersey as we talk about on the call that we would want to that there be a incentive for they to approve domestic manufacturing capacity
and so we believe that they will want to do that with we and we will give they every reason to approve we
so we be go to move forward quickly but we think that there be a incentive for they to do that
Understood
and then you actually just touch on another question I have maybe just elaborate a little bit further
give what be happen regard the coronavirus covid-19 and what appear to be at least the initial stage of a desire to bring more manufacturing back into the country versus China India whatnot how do that set you up
let 's assume we get through the headwind over the next year get through these inspection and what not but how do that set you up go forward give you domestic capacity
I think it set we up well
obviously we be right in the wheelhouse there be a domestic manufacturer
I think it set we up for the potential for success
and while we do not know exactly what it be awful hard to predict exactly what the FDA or what quite frankly the government will do but we feel good about be a domestic manufacturer and we feel good about the opportunity that that be go to present for we in the_future
Ladies and gentleman this conclude we question-and-answer session
I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Sawyer President and CEO for any closing remark
all right
thank you all for you time and attention this_morning
that conclude we call
have a great day
Ladies and gentleman this conclude today 's conference_call
thank you for participate
you may now disconnect
hello and welcome to the Greenbrier company second quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- at the request of the Greenbrier company this conference_call be be record for instant replay purpose
at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Justin Roberts Vice President and Treasurer
Mr. Roberts you may begin
thank you Misty
good morning everyone and welcome to we second quarter of_fiscal conference_call
on today 's call I be join by Greenbrier 's Chairman and CEO Bill Furman Lorie Tekorius President and COO and Adrian Downes Senior Vice President and CFO
they will provide a update on Greenbrier 's near-term priority as we manage through the covid-19_pandemic and then we will discuss the result for the_second_quarter
follow we introductory remark we will open up the call for question
in addition to the press_release issue this_morning which include supplemental datum additional financial information and key metric can be find in a slide presentation post today on the IR section of we website
matter discuss on today 's conference_call include forward-looking statement within the meaning of the private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
throughout we discussion today we will describe some of the important factor that could cause Greenbrier 's actual result in and beyond to differ materially from those express in any forward-looking statement make by or on behalf of Greenbrier
and with that I will pass it over to Bill
thank you Justin and good morning everyone
as we begin I want to take a moment to extend good wish for the health of everyone on the line with we today
I also call out the work of the many health professional emergency responder government official and individual who be on the front line battle this pandemic and those in we Armed Forces and National Guard around the world and here in America
finally I thank all the Greenbrier employee in we factory office and at home each now operate under essential industry status
the world be not only in a severe health crisis but obviously a economic crisis affect business in hand allow we to protect liquidity and maneuver in a way other in other industry and other business can not under current circumstance
we be now operate under essential priority number one to provide for the safety and security of we workforce and number two to provide for the liquidity and economic well-being of the enterprise and its shareholder
in the face of this pandemic management priority and behavior immediately shift to the extraordinary challenge at hand
we quickly implement contingency plan and assemble incident response team
we assess the risk to we business in real-time and be take swift action to ensure Greenbrier be defensively position to manage through a period that present a range of unknown and unknowable challenge
we be safely operate and I emphasize safely operate all we manufacturing and essential service site include those site that manage over of industry railcar in the United_States and North_America
Greenbrier 's operation constitute essential infrastructure and essential business as define by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other U.S. and international agency agency include all stay-at-home order issue in the jurisdiction where we operate at home and abroad
Greenbrier support operation vital for the national transportation system the Department of Defense and other federal agency
we perform we function under the statutory and regulatory authority of the Department of Transportation surface Transportation Board the Federal Railroad Administration and under the Jones Act in we marine operation
accordingly Greenbrier will help maintain the delivery of vital goods include food medical supplies and fuel to community in the United_States and in all the nation that we supply around the world
we will keep we nation and those nation smoothly function in the railroad system
along with the welfare of we employee we be determine to protect the economic well-being of the enterprise during unprecedented market and economic condition
as discuss in we earnings release today we be laser-focused on liquidity
we goal be to produce $ 1 billion in available reliable liquidity within the remain 5 month of we fiscal year end in August of 2020
before the onset of the pandemic we have already begin to reduce the size of we manufacturing footprint due to anticipate lower level of railcar demand and reduce aftermarket activity
adjustment to production and staffing level that begin in September of last year continue into the second and third quarter as we idle excess capacity in north american manufacturing facility largely in Mexico as well as at Greenbrier Rail Services location
since we begin this initiative we have adjust global operation through workforce reduction equal to approximately 20_% of Greenbrier 's total global workforce
these reduction now exceed worker
yesterday we take step which would add another worker over time
we colleague who leave we this fiscal year be people who each make important contribution to we success
many have spend they entire career in this business
they be leave we through no fault of they own
each affect employee be a person with a name and a family
this be a fact we never forget
we recognize that this be a period of shared sacrifice
as a result I have take a voluntary immediate reduction in my salary of $ 250,000
and for we Board of director each have voluntarily reduce they cash compensation
we have freeze pay increase for member of management
moreover cash and earnings will automatically flow from curtail bonus payment if we do not meet targeted performance metric and along with the discretionary reduction that I or the Compensation Committee of the Board of director can request
all that remain to be see but it be a automatic relief valve for difficult time bake into a company that be well-seasoned in deal with difficult time in a cyclical business
this be not we first rodeo
Greenbrier 's business be flexible enough to quickly adapt to change market condition
we franchise be strong and we hold the position as the # 1 or # 2 player in core market demonstrate by the fact that half of this_quarter 's earnings be generate from abroad order I be not not earnings but order
and of that half about car be to be build in North_America by a good customer in the Gulf Cooperative -lrb- sic -rrb- -lsb- cooperation -rsb- Council
we have a strong experienced management team
Greenbrier again have navigate through difficult market in the_past
Historically we have come out stronger as a result of we combined effort
not only do we recover but we transform and dramatically increase the scale of we business through hard work focus execution and diversification of we revenue stream
although this be a stressful time no matter how the remainder of this_year play_out we know we role in the transportation industry remain vital
beyond layoff and other obvious reduction we be commit to take aggressive action to shrink Greenbrier 's cost profile its balance_sheet to improve its balance_sheet
and Lorie and Adrian will speak more to this a little later
base on we current backlog we be leave with very little open production capacity for the remainder of both the fiscal and the calendar year
at Gunderson we marine backlog extend through the fiscal year and the calendar year
we backlog production current production rate stretch into and beyond
a large multiyear manufacturing backlog of railcar unit provide one source of stability in difficult time as we operate we facility
these long-term customer be very reliable and have virtually never waver in fulfil commitment even if they have to at time put car in storage
all that provide resilience and a bridge to industry dynamics and economic condition improve
in addition to the liquidity goal I mention we have stress test Greenbrier 's balance_sheet to we ensure to ensure we liquidity and we have run very many scenario to look at worst case
while we have suspend earnings guidance we expect to remain profitable
we do not know nor can anyone know how this crisis will evolve and resolve
today this be the biggest risk we all face together
scenario may emerge that we can not reasonably anticipate
but we be confident we be manage those factor within we control and we be also to manage other through the worst of time
this mean we be prepare to adapt to the new economic reality
we will take the difficult and necessary action to protect Greenbrier 's economic base preserve its financial stability focus on we core business remove essential -lrb- sic -rrb- -lsb- non-essential -rsb- activity and restore shareholder value for year to come
now over to you Lorie for you comment
thank you Bill
good morning everyone and thank you for join we
I will briefly provide some additional detail on the_quarter although I have to admit that February 29 the end of we quarter seem like a lifetime ago
the world have shift very quickly and we have pivot to respond to the shift global landscape
over the last 6 month we have be rationalize production capacity and overhead in response to anticipated level of new freight railcar demand and reduce aftermarket activity
demand have weaken due to macroeconomic condition include trade dispute faster train speed result from the implementation of psr and significantly lower freight rail loading which have drop sequentially for almost 15 month in nearly all commodity category
the industry remain support by a backlog of over railcar but all builder in North_America have take step to slow production line in
it be important to note that these condition be present and we be adjust capacity prior to the covid-19_pandemic and the collapse in global oil market
we continue to adjust operation as need to ensure the long-term health of Greenbrier
and as a brief recap to the_quarter delivery this_quarter be railcar and we receive order for approximately unit value over $ 815 million
these order originate from international source international commercial effort for a customer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and will be build in and service the north american market
we backlog worldwide remain strong at unit value at $ 3.2 billion
operate performance at we ARI manufacturing facility improve in the_quarter
and we north american manufacturing group continue to perform profitably produce high-quality railcar safely even as production rate be adjust and demand decline
we european and we brazilian operation perform as expect in q2 and order activity be strong
notably we receive the first multiyear order in Brazil in many year
and both we european and brazilian operation be benefit from some rightsize that we execute in fiscal
the continued improvement in we repair operation be a reflection of the remedial action take over the last 18 month
the Wheels Parts operation benefit from they higher seasonal volume although volume be pressured compare to past winter
and we leasing revenue in the_quarter include externally source railcar syndication activity
and as a reminder this activity cause leasing 's gross margin percentage to be lower as a percentage of revenue than its typical 45 % to 50 % range
exclude the externally source syndication activity we leasing segment 's margin percentage be 47.2 %
and with respect to the business response to the covid-19_pandemic all global operation be currently meet or exceed the CDC 's recommendation
to protect we workforce Greenbrier have implement health screening include daily temperature reading operate through split shift enhance social distancing and expand deep cleaning at all location
we be operate under a dual mandate of maintain business continuity alongside ensure employee health and welfare
as a essential business that support global infrastructure Greenbrier be dedicate to fulfil its role to facilitate the continued stability of the transportation supply network
Greenbrier and its employee take the responsibility of help to ensure the delivery of vital goods include food medical supplies and fuel to community very seriously
as you hear from Bill in addition to ensure the business continue to operate we be focus on increase liquidity
this will be accomplish through a variety of action include eliminate nonessential capital expenditure aggressively reduce we overhead and general and administrative expense and evaluate other strategic action
we expect to come through the current crisis as stronger more resilient Greenbrier
as a management team we remain confident in the long-term strategy develop with we Board of director but be focus on execute the near-term priority that Bill describe
now over to you Adrian
thank you Lorie and good morning everyone
as a reminder quarterly financial information be available in the press_release and supplemental slide on we website
highlight for the_second_quarter include revenue of $ 624 million and delivery of unit which include unit in Brazil
aggregate gross margin of 13.8 %
the_quarter include a contract modification payment of $ 9.2 million net of tax which strengthen we backlog and profitability
a hallmark of Greenbrier be the flexibility to find win-win solution to we customer need
net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $ 13.6 million or $ 0.41 per share
exclude approximately $ 1.7 million net of tax or $ 0.05 per share of integration-related expense adjust net earnings attributable to Greenbrier be $ 15.3 million or $ 0.46 per share
and adjust EBITDA in the_quarter be $ 71.6 million or 11.5 % of revenue
we successfully achieve $ 4.3 million of pretax cost synergy relate to the ARI acquisition in the_quarter and $ 7.1 million year-to-date
because of the current uncertainty and shift priority we be not reaffirm we synergy target of $ 15 million in fiscal at this time although we will continue to work towards this target
total liquidity at February 29 be $ 620 million which include $ 170 million of cash and we have no significant debt maturity until late 2023
as you have hear on the call already we be work to significantly expand liquidity through a variety of action with a target of $ 1 billion
we be also in the process of examine the various governmental program available to Greenbrier and we employee include program like the payroll tax deferral provision and employee-friendly modification of exist employee plan as a result of the Cares Act
we plan to utilize these to the fullest extent possible where beneficial
Greenbrier 's Board of director remain committed to a balanced deployment of capital that protect we business and simultaneously create long-term shareholder value
Greenbrier declare a quarterly dividend for consecutive quarter with periodic increase
today we be announce a dividend of $ 0.27 per share which represent a yield of 7.5 % base on yesterday 's closing stock price
as announce in we earnings release we be suspend we prior guidance for the_year
Greenbrier 's management team have a long history of manage through volatile time
while the covid-19_pandemic be without precedent and have create significant uncertainty on a global basis we remain convinced that the proactive action we have take so far and the planned action we have describe today will position the company for long-term strength
now we will open the call for question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- first question come from Justin Long
maybe to start just bigger picture on the industry and what you be anticipate from a railcar production standpoint ftr have recently lower they forecast for and to that kind of low to mid-20,000 unit range
I be curious
as you think about kind of cut back you capacity and some of the thing you discuss in the prepared remark be that the type of build rate from a industry perspective that you be plan on
or do you anticipate any upside or downside to that
and then also if you could just talk about cancellation risk in the backlog or deferral risk in the backlog
curious if you have see any of that play_out in the last month or so
sure
so I will start out and I be sure that Bill will supplement
from a industry outlook perspective ftr certainly have go through several iteration of drop expect delivery in and
right_now with everything that be go_on I think it be really hard to say specifically what delivery might look like the next couple of year
I think it certainly be reasonable that the number that they be project might be the number as you look across the_year
absolutely there be upside
we have see that historically in we market where we can be predict that the sky be fall and then the next thing something wonderful happen
that be one of the thing that we believe we management team and we manufacturing group in particular be very good at be be responsive to when opportunity present themselves
we commercial team be very focus on work closely with we customer and remain flexible so that we can take advantage of those opportunity
so that be why you see we slow production as oppose to stop it all together
if we can continue it at a fairly slow rate we think that give we optionality
and then turn to you second question about risk in the backlog we as we have pour through the backlog and look at the different car type that we be build and it be a broad variety of car type at this point in time we do not have anything that we be overly concern about
but then again how can you work in this point in time and not be overly concern about something
I think we have a good history of work closely with we customer if there be a issue that they raise or a concern that we may need to modify car type or look at delivery timing
but again at this point in time we be feel like we backlog be a very solid position and a good indicator of future activity
the only thing I would add and thank you for you question be that obviously we have have a number of thing occur
Lorie mention a few
but the oil market volatility be of concern not only for the petrochemical and oil by rail business but and while Greenbrier do not have a strong sand concentration many of we investor institutional investor only manage car due
so we be very focus on that
but we be not see cancellation in the sense that you mean it
they be obviously the qualitative aspect of the portfolio be another thing
but I think the kind of nimbleness we commercial team show in this deal that be do to work with a customer to not only improve we backlog but improve we profitability and drive immediate cash flow be something that we will try to do more of in the_future
and we have great customer
we think thing be go to on the back backlog be the strongest thing we have get plus the fact we can operate we factory under the essential service rule
okay
that be really helpful
and then second question I have be on SG&A
I get the suspension of guidance totally understandable in this type of environment
but when you look at the thing you can control and you think about some of the headcount reduction that you have see be there any clarity you can give we on what you be expect for SG&A this_year
what be get bake into the comment that you may build that you expect to remain profitable
Lorie you should address that
I think we want to be cautious about throw number out there
as I say we expect to be profitable
Manufacturing operation be particularly resilient
we do expect to have g&a instruction in all category G&A reduction I mean
it be not just go to be factory people
we already have have and I do not think I do not know what you would like to say about it Lorie
thank you Bill
that be a good lead-in
we be look across the board
we do not take lightly the number of production worker that we have have to let go over the last 6 month
so I would say while we be not willing to put a specific target out there since we be suspend guidance I would say that it be go to be double-digit percentage reduction be go to be the goal in we SG&A couple with look at overhead cost which be some of the thing that oftentimes can get overlook
but as we be resize we manufacturing footprint particularly here in North_America there be overhead type of activity that can also be scale down
so that be where we be pleased that we manufacturing margin have remain in the double digit
and we believe that be because we do know how to scale we workforce both the line worker as well as the overhead to adjust to reduce production rate
and you will be see some reduction in SG&A head count as well as some of the other thing that Bill mention regard he compensation the Board 's compensation
clearly travel restriction the way that they have play_out that be go to have a big impact on SG&A go forward
we have a hire freeze and we will be look at other area where we can call back some cost
next question come from Allison Poliniak
Lorie I just want to follow on that train of thought
obviously you guy be address operation to begin with try to fix and support some of they
as you step back I know it be probably hard today because you be just deal with the general sort of impact on a daily basis
but can you maybe comment in term of what you think you can do structurally to support the foundation that make Greenbrier obviously much stronger come out of this
I mean be you guy even think of that at this point
absolutely
we be think about when we come out of this covid-19 focus right_now try to make particularly we core operation and manufacturing and we commercial group a lot stronger
I think one of the very interesting thing about the pandemic be it be force we to rethink how we work
if you and I think you have be here in we office in Lake Oswego Allison
it be really amazing how much of we service we can continue while probably 90 % of we workforce telecommute
so I think that will be a foundation for how we think about what be go to be we core to support we operation whether it be the folk that we have down in Dallas the folk that we have here in the Portland metropolitan area or even we workforce in St. Charles to rethink how do we use technology to build on have a solid base to support we operation and really think how do we make certain that we have get the best and the brightest supporting that
and maybe there be some cost that we be go to realize that we do not have to continue to incur
Great
and then just I know you touch on Europe obviously close for 2 week there
any color on Brazil
I guess it be not clear to I because we have hear some industry shut_down in Brazil today
be there sort of a slowdown or a stoppage there that you guy be prepare for near term
or be that just business as usual in this environment I guess
right
and yes business as usual to the extent that you can today
it be one of the more interesting thing because we do operate around the globe
every country seem to have a different approach and those approach can change on a daily basis
as I understand it today we operation in Brazil do continue to operate and the government official do encourage we employee to go to work
that would probably be one of the place that we start implement additional health screening measure early on
touch wood everything have be go just fine down there but we will just continue to monitor that
we believe that we have good governmental support
the transportation via the rail will be a essential service and we worker will continue to work
as you know we rightsize that operation last_year
so they be able to operate with a fairly thin bench
and they production rate be a bit more modest than you would see here in North_America
so we will just have to watch and
I would just like to emphasize that the U.S. relationship with Brazil the current administration have show a great deal of interest in Brazil
most of the country in the world be follow U.S. and Western we on essential industry it be a essential industry in Brazil so much of they export and they economy rely in transportation
we be the largest builder of the equipment we build in Brazil
so I think Brazil and Europe we expect those rule to continue in place and we be work with diplomatically with we own government to encourage that to occur
next question come from Bascome Majors
yes
I want to talk a little bit about the syndication channel
that be be a really important piece of you growth over the last several year and it be pretty embed in the model now
can you give we a indication of how some of these financial buyer customer of yours be respond here
and any indication of how much of the backlog today be sort of slate for that channel
thank you Bascome
I will let Lorie or Adrian possibly address the last question
in general we still see a strong distribution network there
I think it be a interesting question because the railcar leasing business be peculiar
it be a business that we have evolve to be in the leasing business
we can create portfolio at will and we can also sell they in effect
I do not believe personally in borrow short and lending long on a 40-year asset
these asset as Tiger Air learn long ago in north american car can come back to haunt you
and they can sink a ship
we system be set up so that we attach lease that be quality lease
and those lease can be deploy to
yes
Chairman CEO create cash_flow and as you point out to create cash margin liquidity and extra value in the model we have
as late as last week we just close a $ 48 million deal with a one of we exist portfolio company a leasing portfolio of company that be a loyal customer
all of we customer who have multiyear agreement include leasing company with whom we work closely be fulfil they obligation
so I think that we be in good shape there
if we be rely on the abs market or something of that nature and where we have partner who be in the fund business they have firm commitment and no ability to have they fund pull
if we be solely in that market I think it would be much weaker position but we have a mixed bag
we be still accept order
and we think we be do well
Lorie you want to talk a little bit more about that
sure
and just do a quick scan of we backlog detail I would say of we Feb 29 backlog probably less than 10_% of it be go into the syndication market at this point in time
yes
that be great news
so it sound like some of the build in that inventory be sell subsequent to quarter end and the $ 50 million deal you mention Bill
be I hear that right
right
and Bascome as you know when you look at that line item on we balance_sheet railcar hold for syndication if you be to do some sort of a trend line over it for the last I do not know 8 to 12 quarter it do go move up and down
not necessarily a indication of anything that be go_on in that particular market but oftentimes it be more a result of when the car be be produce and as we be package a variety of different car type together to put together those syndication package
and again the majority of those be attach to what in a normal market would be money good lease
we could syndicate sell they and receive a margin just for the origination of the today those be good customer
and they have good to 7-year even 10-year or 8-year cash flow attach
so we be simply in the leasing business but in a moderate way
I will also point out that we balance_sheet with that embedded in it it still have a debt equity ratio
we have $ 1.5 billion in net book value equity sit beside we market cap
we also have the a very low amount of debt I guess at about $ 1 billion or so
so I think if you look at the leasing portfolio in the_future we be go to have more clarity for The Street and for we shareholder
we be go to still continue to try to make this more transparent and clearer
the attractiveness of we system in downturn like this be far and away above those who have these lease in return rapid rapidly in rapid amount
thank you for that detailed answer
if I could just tack on a related question on the funding side of that
Bill you mention in short order hope to have access to $ 1 billion worth of liquidity
I think you say today you be at about $ 600 million
can you just give we maybe a sneak peek at what you think that other $ 400 million could look like
yes
I be go to let Lorie walk through that
unless you want I to take that Lorie
I could generally make some comment capex and
no
I would say I will thanks Bill and I be sure that you will supplement or Adrian can as well or Justin we Treasurer
we have all be up to we eyeball in think about all the various way that we can look towards liquidity in this time of uncertainty
so capex be one of the more significant item that we have already be think about put on the brake we be put on the brake a lot harder
if you look at what we be think we would do as we enter this fiscal year versus where we be say we be go to be now and even at that I would suspect that we capex can come down further from what we be show in the 10-q when it get file later today or if you be look at the supplemental slide
and I do not expect that when we hit August 31 it be just go to we be go to flip a switch and go back to business as usual
I think that we be go to be focus on really make certain that we be deploy capital in the best way possible from a capital from a property , plant and equipment perspective for a time to come
additionally like we talk about there would be overhead and G&A reduction
I would say that could be probably nearly as much as what we be expect in the CapEx reduction
some of that will take a little bit of time to get momentum
we be see we spending level be lower in the first half of actually this fiscal year be not what we be initially anticipate
again a lot of that come as we be make adjustment to reduce production rate and lower demand
and the other thing that we will be look at be what I consider strategic initiative and some of that be look at we exist credit facility and figure out there be a couple of avenue where we can access additional capital under we exist credit facility
so these be not amendment
these be not go out for new debt
this be just utilize what we currently have at we fingertip as well as evaluate we operating base
and that particular bucket would be fairly sizable $ 100 million $ 150 million for example
there be a number of these thing
we do not have we be not talk about tap the credit market in any at a financing other than maybe some top-off financing if we find a good deal
so if you look at all of these thing we be theoretically it should be able to go over $ 1 billion
but the strategic aspect of noncore business cut cost conserve cash it all start mount up pretty quickly
so we think the target be realistic and achievable in the next 5 month of this year
next question come from Ken Hoexter
Great
just can you talk maybe Lorie about base level of production give you contract
usually you see a bounce in the second half
be that production line capability or demand for car type that scale in the second half
I guess you get to go back to maybe 2013 before we see real weakness in that fiscal third quarter
so I guess what I be ask be if the backlog be so strong and op be ongoing what do you need to slash
do the backlog have greater deferral than you target
can you cancel you own self order
but that kind of do not make sense if you note all slot be fill for production
so maybe just talk about how we should think about that railcar build go into the rest of the_year
sure
and we have be as we say reduce production rate
I would say right_now in North_America we be probably maybe 75 % of we theoretical capacity be where we be operate
we would see that come down maybe another 5 % or 10_% as we exit the fiscal year
and that be know what we know today
obviously there be a number of thing that can change
we do not believe that we have get any significant issue with any of we scheduled production or any of we customer look to defer that further
matter of fact we have some customer who be pretty excite to accelerate production but we be try to balance that with we workforce
we do not want to let people go and then pull they back and then let they go again
one of the way that we be able to maintain good manufacturing margin be have set production rate and a steady workforce
so as we look at the rest of the_year we be look at thing like reduce where we be run on shift at some of we facility and pull that back to run just shift maybe work 4 day instead of or 6 day a week
those be the kind of measure that we manufacturing team be look at to balance we headcount with the production rate
and again as you think about it we do have strong backlog but overall demand have subside
and we want to make certain that we be appropriately pacing we production to meet we customer need but also to take we through the next 1.5 year or so
yes
unfortunately if you look at that production you have get to increase inventory
we be go to constrict inventory
we would like to pace thing as Lorie say
if you take a step back a couple of step back though and you see the government policy as it sort out at different level it be quite clear what the intent be keep people home break the back of the virus level of curve
we hear all those thing but I be not so sure everybody understand why they be do it what the end game be
there be various scenario of course as we hit the peak in this but they be basically try to push this down to maintain we hospital and capability to deal with the patient
there will be therefore a effort to return to normalcy
and already you be see in Europe and we have the benefit of that vision from or 3 month ago what happen if there be success
even Italy be have some now green shoot as report this_morning
so I think that if you look at what be go on here you can have more comfort that there might be a return to normalcy or closer something closer back for some of the thing that we normally see at the end of by the last 2 quarter of we fiscal year
we be not expect that
we be manage for cash and we resolve be very firm
we be look to protect the downside and hope very hopeful very hopeful for the upside and we will be willing and capable of respond to it when it come and it will come
I guess what I be just confuse by the answer maybe just to clarify it a little bit more be if every slot be fill and nothing have change on that what change on the second half right
because you have say every production slot be fill
be it that you be slow down because customer do not want it
Lorie say it seem right
let I interrupt you just for a moment
just say what Lorie 's say I think what I be say be every slot be fill but we be reduce the flow-through so we can reduce we overhead and we can optimize cash
so this be something we be work with we customer to do
and I do not think the last 2 quarter of this year will be necessarily follow a pattern of the last few year
at least that be a simple answer to I think you question
no
that make a lot that make sense
again I appreciate that
we be do this as we be self-impose a lot of this ourselves
yes
no no
I get it slow production
and then Lorie just to clarify on what you be talk with Bascome about the lease railcar for syndication
do that mean you be keep more of what you build
or I just want to understand the temporary view of what Bill say be the $ 50 million sale
be that just you have some extra at the end of the quarter and then you sell they
or I just want to understand or be you build more because you say the backlog be not that great in term of what you be keep
but it look like with those lease railcar for syndication on the balance_sheet jump up
so be that temporary keep more of what you build
right
so again what I be try to say to Bascome and thanks for the question be the timing of syndication be not necessarily linear
and so as you look at the February balance sheet it have a higher than-normal value and number of unit in railcar sale for syndication
what bill be reference be something that happen in March mean that the syndication and we partner be still open for business
and some of that move off of we balance_sheet in the month of March
we expect that to continue
to the question about how much be in we backlog associate with lease that we expect to syndicate that be a fairly small number I think what you be see be what have be happen over the last 6 month where lease origination have flow
it be not that we be expect to keep those on we balance_sheet
it be just that side of the market slow down a little bit consistent with the broader demand for new railcar
in we scenario I anticipate that we may have to keep a large amount on we balance_sheet and that be why we think we need the extra capital
we downside scenario
we downside scenario
and we do post-quarter do a lot more in clear syndication and asset a lot much more than the $ 48 million
that be a single deal
we do
senior vp CFO Chief Accounting Officer or
Chairman & CEO 2 or 3 time that I imagine
or other big deal
and so the market be still open to we
and I think the term be change
profitability might change but we think we have get a good handle on that
and that be however that be the other big risk that we be manage besides keep we factory run under the protection that we have and other car builder may have as essential industry
just to underline what Bill say earlier again even if these asset stay on the balance_sheet they be generate lease income
yes
no I appreciate all the answer and time
if I could just get one housekeeping Justin what be the marine backlog for the_quarter
it be probably around I think $ 60 million to $ 70 million
I think it be $ 59 million or $ 60 million
yes
so about $ 60 million
next question come from Steve Barger
understandable why you would want to reduce capacity
but how do you decide which plant to close
and I be specifically think about see more of the reduction come from the lower-cost mexican on the U.S. to avoid potential border issue
partly the second one
but mainly it be the product mix
the big hit be the general-type car hit in plant we plant in Sahagun in Hidalgo the state of Hidalgo
we joint venture plant have a very good specialization in tank car
we produce tank car at we plant which be Tlaxcala state of Tlaxcala in Tlaxcala the city be Tlaxcala
so I think it be more select product mix couple with at the time some concern about move a bit more to the U.S. footprint and test the efficiency of the ARI facility
and they be reasonably efficient
but it be true that the mexican base in normal circumstance be in a very very efficient base
and we expect when normalcy return to go back to business as usual in all factory in Mexico
and I would say at this point we be not have any significant supply chain issue for the north american market
we have actually plan ahead as many company do before the Lunar New Year and have stock up on inventory that we would have be get elsewhere
the essential business that we be operate under actually impact we supplier as well so we have be able to maintain the supply_chain
the one exception be a little bit in Europe where that part of what lead to a 2-week closure for the_year a extended Easter holiday be to allow the supply_chain to get catch up
they do transport more via the road versus on the rail
and I be sure everyone see the picture as border be shut and they it take a little bit of time for they to figure out how to expedite the transportation of some of those supplies across border
it be really important to understand what happen in Europe and compare it here
you can imagine what would occur at interstate commerce if each state put up roadblock and barrier and delay interstate commerce from one state to another or in the case of Europe from one city to the other
in Italy for example the individual account be have blockade
you can not go in
you can not go out
but we do not have not come to that in America yet
we be prepare if it be to come to deal in that environment
and we have issue credentials to all of we essential employee so that they can continue business operating as a essential U.S. industry
and we believe we supply_chain be through the railroad system
this be a great advantage of rail
and it be a spectacular advantage of rail because they do not have to stop at the border and they be protect
this be a very big thing to understand
it be go to give we a real hit in the rail sector in Europe in a sense of a heavy uplift
so I think that be kind of a silver lining in this cloud
we do not hope we hope that this be not go to occur in America but it could
and if it happen we be ready for it and the rail be go to be the solution
that be great color
and just to the point on the mix for the south of the border facility how should we think about modeling minority interest in the back half
will you see lower production from GIMSA
I would suspect if you want to model and we be not give guidance but I think one of the thing you might notice in we press_release today be minority interest be a bit lower than normal
that be tie into the timing of railcar syndication
so less of the GIMSA joint venture up in revenue and gross margin therefore less go out as we partner share
I would expect that to turn to be more normalize like in the_first_quarter for the next couple of quarter as the syndication work they way out
however can I just make one comment
we be work with we partner there give these special circumstance to correct that imbalance
and if we succeed in reach a accord I think we will have a uplift to that category
so all of Lorie 's comment we may have a more favorable picture
and that be a bucket of cash that we expect we might be able to also obtain in that relationship that we have a very supportive partner there
I be really pleased with they cooperation
so it be a source of cash
and I think we will see I be pretty positive we will have some good news to announce on that
we will probably we will be very transparent when we finish it too
and just for clarity around liquidity and cash_flow
you have give a lot of detail around be able to generate cash savings from the action you be take
and but as you think about production expectation manage working capital timing of syndication activity do you expect positive operating cash flow this_year
yes
yes we do
and with lower capex will you generate free cash_flow this_year
I would say that we feel pretty confident that we will be I think at this point base on what we see that be a strong possibility
again borrow Bill 's phrase we do not know what we do not know at this point
and but from what we see as the lay of the land currently that be the plan that we be work towards
the great thing if you can operate you factory be that this kind of business throw off cash_flow as you liquidate inventory
normally in normal cycle you would not have this issue with cash because you throw off a lot of cash
so it should be positive
however if you can not operate you factory which be the situation many company be in then you can not run it up and everything be on its turn upside down
we expect to keep we factory operate safely and that be a core risk or threat we be manage
last question come from Matt Elkott
once we have make it out of this pandemic and it be well in the rearview mirror be we look at a manufacturing footprint that be adjust and rightsize on a permanent basis mean total production output less than pre-pandemic level
we would call it optimize
yes
we be optimize we total footprint for the expect market longer term
we have a great franchise
we have great market
we simply need to prune the tree a bit
and we need to look very very hard in the strategic bucket that Lorie be talk about about noncore nonessential business to Greenbrier not nonessential in the nature of the business but those business that be not central to we new footprint
it be just time to prune the tree create cash run the company for cash improve shareholder value over the immediate future
I might remind you that after the Great Depression or the last pandemic of this scale after World War I the Great War everybody come back
they have great casualty rate from that
and then come the roar
so with people housebound and unable to buy once they get out they be go to be shopping I think
at least some of they will
many of they that I know will
yes
that be helpful
Thought I would know
and also I just want to make sure I understand something on the cadence and deliveries
I know you guy remove for a fee some car from for the backlog that be suppose to be deliver in future period
Historically you second half delivery be higher than you first half delivery at least in the last couple of fiscal year
now give the fact that it seem like you guy be not currently engage in any further conversation about further cancellation or deferment will the second half delivery be higher than the first half delivery if no more cancellation occur
I think that be a good estimation be that the second half would be stronger than the first half on a deliveries perspective
some of it be just again the timing of syndication and the stuff that be on the balance_sheet which will flow through and be count as a delivery in the second half
that will offset some of the production reduction that we be do
but all in I would say at least what we know today second half delivery possibly a little bit stronger than first half
some of that be drive by international operation not necessarily north american operation
so and again this be part of why we be suspend guidance be every day bring new activity
and by new activity I do not mean conversation with customer about potential cancellation but edict by government and municipality and that create a stir and stress on workforce and whether or not people can go to work et_cetera et_cetera
we feel very comfortable and strongly that we be a essential business and we will continue to operate but that do not mean that we be not a little bit less efficient as you continue to deal with some of the unavoidable stress associate with this pandemic
get it
so you mention Lorie the international deliveries
so when all this be say and do when you be we likely to look back and say that the fact that you be the only north american manufacturer with significant international operation help you kind of soften or mitigate the blow of the apex give the rolling infection apex around the world
so if one place be in lockdown another place may not be
so be that go to you think play to you advantage when this be all say and do
I would say that we strategy of expand we footprint internationally absolutely be go to help we be a stronger and more resilient and more liquid entity go forward
unfortunately it be not like you can shift production out of let 's say the United_States down to Brazil to bring back to the United_States so but we do think have manufacturing and rail freight presence in some of these market that we believe will be very strong market for railcar production and freight loading
so Brazil and Europe do make we a stronger company go forward
of course
can I just give a example of that Lorie
in Europe the difference be post crisis that favor rail be not go to be dramatic because of the issue with border crossing they have have and that be quite clear
but there already be a very healthy green movement and a very large investment in rail in the billion to take traffic away from choke highway and other business
so this be go to be very positive for Europe
Brazil similarly have those kind of force go_on
so I think that diversification as Europe come out of this earlier than we do will help Greenbrier a very great deal
get it
and just one final question Bill related to what you be just explain
in past recession you guy deal with loss in the Great recession and I think in
can you maybe summarize for we how Greenbrier be different today than it be in and then during the Great recession
sure
I will take a shot at it and Lorie can add
but basically we product mix be dramatically different
we industry leadership be different
we have a spectacularly different franchise # 1 or # 2 in major market internationally
North_America we have diversify we footprint to have more optionality in the United_States
we have some efficient plan for get those knock into shape and they be make progress every quarter in Arkansas
so I think the company be dramatically different than it be
we management team be together
it be experienced
Lorie and the financial team be do a great job but Lorie be also get a great deal of experience in operation turn around a lot of some of the last year 's issue
and I think the company be really on a very solid strategic footing at this point
we have to get through this crisis like everybody else

good morning and thank you for join we
today I will recap simply good Foods second quarter highlight and provide you with some detail on the performance of we Atkins and Quest brand
then Todd will discuss we second quarter financial result in a bit more detail and we will wrap it up with a discussion of we outlook and then open the call to you question
before we get into the detail of we q2 result I would like to discuss the impact we be see with respect to covid-19
overall the first half of fiscal which end on February 29 exceed we expectation with no material impact from covid-19
we enter the second half of the fiscal year with positive net sale momentum solid cost containment and confidence in we ability to execute we plan and to deliver on the outlook we provide on we earnings on January 9
furthermore the Quest integration be on track and we synergy plan be proceed as expect
in March overall retail foot traffic be extremely volatile with the surge in the beginning of the month follow by a significant slowdown in the second half of the month at most brick-and-mortar retailer
the retail takeaway trend of both we category and we brand follow a similar pattern
give the likely continue uncertainty around consumer purchasing behavior due to covid-19 movement restriction we believe it be prudent to withdraw we fiscal full year guidance at this time
we key priority now be to safeguard the continued health of we employee and community ensure the reliability of we supply_chain and provide accurate and timely service to we retail customer and consumer
we be in close communication with we key customer and supplier
and to date we supply_chain remain robust and fully operational
we contract manufacturer be take extra measure to ensure that they be provide they worker with a safe environment and be commit to meet the consumer and customer requirement of we business in the come week and month
next we will do what be right for the long-term health of we employee brand and business
now let 's move on to slide and discuss we fiscal second quarter result
second quarter result be greater than we expectation as both Atkins and Quest deliver strong sale growth as well as gross and adjusted ebitda margin expansion
Legacy Atkins retail takeaway in the_second_quarter be generally in line with we estimate
growth be drive by bar and confection across all channel
additionally Atkins e-commerce momentum continue with sale up double digit
Quest 's q2 result be strong across all metric and be track to we acquisition model
integration work continue and be progress on schedule
in we fiscal second quarter and for the year-to-date period the nutritional snack category increase mid to high single digit
the growth rate may move around a bit in the short term due to change shopping behavior related to covid-19 movement restriction
but over the long term we believe the megatrend that have fuel nutritious snack category such as healthy snacking convenience meal replacement and on-the-go consumption will continue to be tailwind for we business and brand
in Atkins and Quest we have trust advantaged lifestyle brand that target different consumer group and position we to maintain we leadership role within the category
on a run rate apples-to-apple basis we have a scale business with net sale in excess of $ 900 million and we outsourced supply_chain enable solid margin low capex and result in strong cash generation
the Atkins and Quest brand be tightly align around the consumer megatrend such as more frequent snack occasion and the desire for on-the-go meal replacement
in addition we product be uniquely position to benefit from grow consumer interest at high protein low carb and minimal sugar
this profile have broad appeal to consumer interest in better-for-you as well as weight management and active nutrition shopper look to achieve they goal
and while we like the diversified form on this page bar chip shake cookie and confection we also have a solid r&d pipeline that we will continue to work on and refine
this be a advantaged portfolio with solid margin and financial flexibility to invest in marketing to drive growth
turn to the_second_quarter net sale increase 83.4 %
Legacy Atkins net sale increase 12.1 % and as expect outpace the increase in retail takeaway due to we strong e-commerce growth as well as a slight seasonal inventory build
the contribution from Quest be a 71.3 % benefit to net sale growth and grow strong double digit versus the comparable period a year ago
the increase in adjusted ebitda be a direct result of higher gross profit drive by higher Atkins net sale and the benefit of Quest
the increase in gross profit be partially offset by the timing of marketing we previously discuss
total simply good Foods Company 's second quarter and year-to-date retail takeaway in the IRI MULO measure outlet universe increase 11.8 % and 13.6 % respectively
note that this include the traditional food drug and mass merchandiser as well as Walmart BJ 's Sam 's and dollar store
additionally IRI MULO capture about 90 % of legacy Atkins U.S. sale
however it only represent about 50_% of Quest 's sale
Atkins q2 retail takeaway increase 6.1 % with growth across all major channel
we be particularly please with we performance in the club channel which be up strong double digit on a percentage basis versus last_year
and Atkins e-commerce business continue to do well up about 60 % in both the_quarter and year-to-date period with bar shake and confection all up double digit
and while early on we momentum here have continue into q3
year-to-date e-commerce represent nearly 7 % of Atkins total gross sale
we have double we e commerce business over the last 2 year and anticipate continued growth over we strategic planning cycle
Quest 's second quarter nutritional snack growth be up about 27 % drive by growth in food mass and club channel
in nonmeasured channel the specialty class of trade have be a headwind
this be a broader multiyear category issue and not specific to Quest
and give the covid-19 movement restriction the specialty channel could be a greater headwind in the balance of fiscal
the building block of Atkins point-of-sale growth be similar to what we discuss over the last few year strong base velocity growth
by form year-to-date bar and confection retail takeaway growth remain strong up about 8 % and 31 % respectively
shake be off roughly 4 % in the_second_quarter and the year-to-date period due to challenging year ago comp and other new branded product entry as well as a distribution loss of we 30-gram shake at a couple of retailer
as expect base velocity in bar and confection be solid and distribution be down due to shake as well as the decision we make last_year to close some underperform bar flavor to free up supply capacity
promotional volume return to more normalize level follow we scale back in fiscal due to supply constraint
although this may not be the case in the second half of the_year due to change shopping behavior related to the covid-19 situation retailer be reevaluate the timing of shelf reset and promotion plan that may result in a delay or cancellation of some of we previous agree to program
let I now turn to Quest
as a reminder Quest be a uniquely positioned brand
the management team have do a great job transition its position from a high-protein bar brand to a broader healthy lifestyle snack brand focus on provide craveable food back by metabolic science
about of the business be the core protein snack bar with the remain consist of fast-growing product such as protein chip cookie and pizza
but no matter which product you consume the nutritional profile be the same high in protein low in carb with minimal sugar
additionally Quest generate about half of its U.S. sale in the IRI MULO universe in traditional food drug mass and club channel
the other half of Quest 's U.S. sale be generate in the convenience store class of trade and the unmeasured e-commerce and specialty channel which be not track by IRI or MULO
Quest 's year-to-date retail takeaway in the measure IRI MULO universe increase 27.6 % with equally balanced gain from both base velocity and distribution gain
growth across all major form be up double digit on a percentage basis versus last_year include the important bar business which increase 12.7 % in measure channel
the Quest team continue to do a great job of drive awareness consideration and trial via they sophisticated digital and social marketing effort
the unique Quest Squad influencer network be effective in attract and retain core consumer
the presence across various social media platform such as Instagram where Quest have nearly follower have drive solid growth
and the Quest R&D team have recently launch some close-in flavor and line extension as well as some new pack type such as the snack bar and 4-pack protein chip depict on this slide
we be confident in we long-term growth plan for this business
it be a scale lifestyle consumer brand and not just a single product
and like Atkins it be back by a underlie nutritional philosophy support by science high protein to improve strength and low carb and sugar to minimize blood sugar spike while provide a steady source of energy
Quest be in the early inning of grow brand awareness consideration and trial and we believe a significant runway exist for long-term growth
in summary the simply good Foods Company compete in a attractive category and be a leader in that category
the combination of Atkins and Quest provide we with uniquely positioned brand and a diversified portfolio that be align around the consumer megatrend of wellness snacking convenience and meal replacement
we be operate we business for the long term and commit to do the right thing for we employee customer and consumer during this challenging time
now I will turn the call over to Todd who will provide you with some greater financial detail
thank you Joe and good morning everyone
let I start with point as it relate to the number you see on the slide that follow
first for comparative purpose we will review financial statement with the and 26 week end February 29 , 2020
second give we asset-light strong cash flow business model we evaluate we performance on a adjusted basis as it relate to ebitda and diluted earnings per share
we have include a detailed reconciliation from gaap to adjust historical item in today 's press_release
we believe these adjust measure be a key indicator of the true underlie performance of the business
I will begin with a review of we net sale driver of growth
second quarter U.S. legacy Atkins volume growth be 13 %
higher volume be partially offset by greater trade promotion result in total U.S. legacy Atkins net sale growth of 12 %
as expect this be greater than the retail takeaway growth of 6.1 % give the continued strength of we nonmeasured e-commerce business as well as a slight seasonal inventory build
Legacy Atkins non-u.s. net sale include Canada and we international business be up a healthy 13.5 %
as a result total organic net sale growth in the_quarter be 12.1 %
the q2 Quest contribution be a 71.3 % benefit result in total q2 net sale increase of 83.4 %
now for a review of second quarter result across other major metric
Gross profit be $ 85.4 million a increase of $ 35.7 million or 72 % drive by legacy Atkins sale growth and the inclusion of Quest partially offset by a noncash $ 5.1 million inventory purchase accounting step-up adjustment related to the Quest acquisition which be now complete
as a result gross margin be 37.6 % a basis point decline versus last_year
the noncash inventory step-up adversely impact gross margin by basis_point
Quest 's lower gross margin and the previously mention increase in trade promotion be a basis point headwind
input cost be relatively benign in the_quarter and we expect only modest inflation for the_year
adjust ebitda increase 81.7 % to $ 41.7 million drive by the increase in gross profit partially offset by selling and marketing expense which increase 83.6 % or $ 12.3 million to $ 27 million
the majority of the increase about 75 % be due to the addition of Quest and the remainder drive by the timing of we higher legacy Atkins marketing expense as discuss previously
additionally g&a expense increase by 82 % in q2 primarily attributable to Quest as legacy Atkins be relatively flat to the year ago period
move to other item in the P&L
interest expense increase $ 7.2 million to $ 10.6 million due to the than the year ago period of 24 %
as a result report net income in q2 be $ 10.7 million versus $ 12.7 million in the year ago period
year-to-date result be as follow
as I indicate earlier net sale be drive primarily by volume growth and the Quest acquisition
Gross profit be $ 147.6 million a increase of $ 46 million or 45.3 % drive by legacy Atkins sale growth and Quest
this be partially offset by the noncash $ 7.5 million inventory purchase accounting step-up adjustment related to the Quest acquisition
as a result gross margin be 38.9 % a basis point decline versus last_year
the noncash inventory step-up adversely impact year-to-date gross margin by basis_point
Quest 's lower gross margin and the previously mention increase in trade promotion be a basis point headwind
adjust ebitda increase 48 % to $ 73.5 million drive by the increase in gross profit partially offset by selling and marketing expense which increase 51.3 % or $ 15.4 million to $ 45.5 million
the majority of the increase about 75 % be due to the acquisition of Quest and the timing of higher legacy Atkins marketing expense as discuss previously
additionally g&a expense increase $ 14.5 million to $ 36.6 million primarily attributable to Quest and higher legacy Atkins employee-related cost
Business transaction cost be $ 26.9 million and primarily associate with Quest acquisition
move to the other item in the P&L
the net impact of interest income and interest expense be a increase of $ 9 million due to the increase in the term loan balance
year-to-date income tax expense be $ 2.2 million versus $ 8.7 million in the_prior_year
in fiscal we anticipate a effective tax rate of around 26 %
as a result q2 year-to-date report net income be $ 5.9 million versus $ 28 million last_year
now turn to earnings per share
in the second quarter of 2020 the company report $ 0.11 per share dilute compare with $ 0.15 per share dilute for the comparable period of
the q2 year-over-year change be impact by the noncash inventory step-up of $ 5.1 million integration cost of $ 3.9 million and business combination cost of around $ 700,000
adjust diluted ep be $ 0.23 a increase of $ 0.05 versus the year ago period
note that we calculate adjust diluted ep as adjust EBITDA less interest income interest expense and income tax
year-to-date report eps be $ 0.06 versus $ 0.33 per share dilute in the_prior_year impact by the noncash inventory step-up of $ 7.5 million integration cost of $ 5.3 million and business combination cost of $ 26.9 million
year-to-date adjust eps be $ 0.45 a increase of $ 0.06 versus the year ago period
please refer to today 's press_release for a explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measure
move on to the balance_sheet and cash_flow
year-to-date we pay down $ 21 million of term loan
and at quarter end the outstanding term loan balance be $ 635.5 million
give we cash balance and we outstanding term loan balance at the end of the second quarter we be well on track to achieve we trail 12-month net debt to adjust EBITDA target of less than x by fiscal year-end
give the unpredictable nature of the covid-19 crisis in March the company begin to increase finish goods inventory of some of its high-velocity product
in conjunction with this as well as for other work capital and general corporate purpose the company draw down $ 25 million of the $ 75 million available under its revolving credit facility
the company believe it be in a strong liquidity position
and at the end of March the company 's estimated cash balance be about $ 80 million
we anticipate the net impact of interest income and interest expense to be in the $ 33 million to $ 35 million range a increase of $ 1 million versus we previous estimate due to the drawdown of the revolver
year-to-date depreciation and amortization be $ 7.1 million and capital expenditure be about $ 0.5 million
capex for fiscal be expect to be about $ 5 million drive primarily by the erp implementation
let I now provide you with a brief update on the Quest integration
the identify cost synergy of $ 20 million be on track and will begin to materially flow through the in fiscal year 2021
the major part of the integration work stream be well underway and tracking with we plan
specifically the supply chain team be work on a integrated approach to procurement distribution and warehousing
work and discussion with vendor be proceed as plan
additionally the Quest and Atkins IT team be work collaboratively on erp implementation onto Quest 's exist platform
to date we be on schedule and have not encounter any major obstacle
despite the challenge of everyone work remotely this be one of we top priority and the integration steer committee be in constant communication to ensure that we be progress on we time line
I would now like to turn the call back to Joe for close remark
thanks Todd
as I previously state we first half of fiscal performance exceed we expectation
and as we begin the second half of the_year we be confident in we ability to achieve we previously communicate fiscal year_2020 outlook
however in March retail foot traffic be volatile
retail takeaway of we product be very strong in the first half of the month follow by a notable slowdown thereafter underscore the unpredictable nature of the current consumer purchase behavior due to covid-19
the severity and duration of the current situation be uncertain and will likely continue during much of the second half of we fiscal
therefore give the rapidly evolve situation and the uncertainty related to the potential effect of the covid-19 outbreak we believe it be prudent to withdraw we previously communicate fiscal outlook
we will continue to monitor this situation and we will provide additional perspective on the_year during we fiscal third quarter conference call in early July
as I mention earlier we be fortunate to participate in the category that have so many positive underlie growth characteristic
we believe that health and wellness will continue to be a important part of consumer life that the megatrend relate to healthy snacking convenience meal replacement and on-the-go eating be long-term trend and that the low household penetration of this category will be a tailwind for we business for year to come
as such we believe and have confidence in the long-term growth prospects of we brand and we business
finally I want to extend my appreciation during these unique time
first thank you to we employee in Denver El Segundo and around the world
they have adjust remarkably well to they new remote work environment
despite juggle multiple new challenge at home they have continue to collaborate well and execute superbly
second I want to thank the leadership team of simply good and Quest as well as we Board of director
with they continued guidance and leadership I be confident we will navigate the short-term challenge of this situation while position the business for continued long-term growth
we appreciate everyone 's interest in we company and be now available to take you question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we first question come from Chris Growe with Stifel
glad to hear you guy be healthy and hope it stay that way
I just think I would ask you first of all as we think about this very loyal consumer base you have just want to get a sense from you Joe if you can speak to it I know it be very early but how those kind of those consumer react in this environment
and then I be just curious how you get a sense of that
be it through e-commerce trend
sound like those be strong through March
I would say that be probably tick up a bit
you have see more activity through you website
be there panel datum
just to get a sense of how these consumer be react now if you have any sense of that and then how you be go to track that
yes Chris good question
again very early early stage of this
and I think right_now the big driver of this have be shop behavior influence more than it be consumption behavior influence
so we have a pretty good view of what be go_on from a shopping standpoint
and as we say in we prepared comment that March be really volatile
through the early portion of March up to the weekend of the 21st we see a significant spike in foot traffic and a significant uptick in we business in both we business as well as the category
the weekend of the 20th and 21st appear to be a inflection point in people 's shopping behavior a dramatic falloff double-digit falloff that have remain through that remain through the end of the month and people 's shopping pattern and go into store
we see significant channel shift
so e-commerce online pickup and delivery all accelerate
and then brick-and-mortar see a significant falloff that be kind of remain until now
so most of it right_now I would say Chris be shop behavior drive more than it be consumption drive
and right_now we do not have a really good read on how the confinement be influence how people consume the product
I can give you my anecdotal experience
it be you home the pantry be pretty close and I be snack more frequently
so I think from a snack behavior we category will do well once we get over some of the shopping behavior issue
I think obviously the on-the-go aspect of this category be go to be a negative drag for we offset somewhat by the snack behavior increase
but really early inning at this point
we do not know a whole lot about consumption behavior
and we view of how we be think about guidance have much to do with uncertainty around shopping behavior and the decision people be make when they go in the store
and presumably in any give period there be volatile week and it be obviously very unique no question
I have hear anecdotally as well you have see a pickup in sale in early April here snap benefit
and again there be another reload if you will of pantry loading
so have that pick up a bit
have you see that of late in most recent day and the week or any sense of that yet
yes
last few day have be much better than the previous 2 week yes
okay
that be what I assume
it be go to be jump around yes
yes
and that be I think that be in part one of the reason that we suspend guidance
just the sheer level of volatility of what people be do
I would also add I have be into a fair number of store just watch shopping behavior
and actually in the store the behavior be really interesting
so people be move into the store quickly do they shopping and for the most part stay in center of store
so shopping shelf stable I would say basic staple and get out of the store pretty quickly
so one of the behavior we notice early in this be even when people be shop they be avoid the perimeter not always get into the health and beauty section where a predominant number of we product be
and that have some impact to foot traffic in the aisle and then obviously purchase behavior impact
well let 's hope they go online to buy that the item they miss when they go through that section
so I appreciate you color there and I will leave it on for the next question
we next question come from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies
those be all good question by Mr. Growe
I guess it seem like what you be imply obviously or what you be say be there be a ton of volatility
we all understand that
just I have have a number of people ask I this_morning
if q2 come in so well though right I mean you come in with above 12 % organic sale growth and that be to the end of February and you also have 12 % in the first half then the first half at 12 % the guidance be still kind of high end to 4 % to 6 %
obviously everything have change since then
you put in you say in a statement though that track to still hit that guidance
even though there be volatility in the back half we do not really know what be go to happen in the back half
but at the same time just to try to find keep it positive here
in q2 if you put up 12 % I know there be a lot of concern probably in the shake business come out of the February datum trend you quarterly growth through February
so there be no covid prebuying impact let 's say outside of the inventory build
net-net it seem like that business actually do better on the bar side than you would have think because the narrative kind of come into today and through February be would seem like they be do worse in shake
so there be more competition in shake
so we worry about shake what about shake but you actually blow away expectation in the_quarter which would make I think that you actually be way ahead of expectation on bar
so I just as we think about the kind of the base business right at COVID ex near-term behavior shift can you just speak to that bar business and the shake business in q2 pre-covid
yes Rob
we feel as I say in the prepared comment we feel very good about where we be through the midyear obviously pre covid-19
we both of we brand be at or exceed expectation through the first half of the year
and we feel we be well positioned and very confident in we ability to deliver the_year
so I think that be clear cut
so we decision go forward be much more to do about consumer shopping behavior over the month of March and the unpredictability of project that behavior go forward
I would also add that the decision to suspend guidance be a more strategic decision and not just about the uncertainty and the magnitude of the duration of consumer shopping behavior although that clearly be a important factor
it also reflect we current priority namely to protect we employee and we community ensure the robustness of we supply_chain and provide service to we customer and consumer
so for we it be much more about do the right thing for we business over these challenging time than it be just about the pos
but again to reiterate we feel really good about where we be
we feel very confident pre covid-19 that we be go to be able to achieve we financial guidance
and we feel good about the composition of we business
as you have mention it have be drive through the first half of the year by strong bar and confection business
we have a rtd business that for the first half of the year be down a little bit
we feel good about the plan we have put into place in the second half of the_year to get that move into positive digit
and all in all prior to the confinement the consumer confinement we be really confident that we have momentum on we side and we would close the second half of the_year strongly
okay great
and then just one follow-up
obviously give everything that be occur within consumer behavior and what you be say about the perimeter of the store relative to the center of the store as that relate to the marketing plan promotional plan how quickly do you think those plan could actually shift they capital allocation could shift
like I be ask more about position online right
it seem like good protein shelf-stable product
if you have the right placement let 's say online like on a Amazon you could shift that very quickly relative to be shift you product placement within the store
be there ability to shift promotional spend or rather marketing spend or product placement spend on the page upfront to try to actually further increase and grow that online business give the current dynamic
that be it
so Rob , excellent question already underway
so we have obviously see as I mention in the prepared comment we e-commerce business the post covid-19 have accelerate as be other online delivery and pickup
so people be the best they can try to avoid go in the store and choose other means of buying product
so we have see that significant pickup in we business at other channel
that have lead we to shift marketing spend already to promote we brand in those channel in order to keep some marketing pressure on the business
so good question
we next question come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein
okay
can I ask about the supply_chain
and I notice that you be use co-manufacture for all of you supply
how much flexibility be there to ramp up production in those facility
and also how dedicate be the plant
I mean if one of they go off-line because of covid-19 could other plant pick up that capacity
I be think about both bar and shake
how much could you increase production on a steady state over the next few month while restaurant traffic be down
yes
good question Alexia
first the we have be in constant communication not only with we contract manufacturer but communication upstream with we ingredient supplier
they situation they be well prepare for this
we have be in communication for over 5 week with these supplier to understand what they plan be come into the situation
and we be very confident in the robustness of we co-man we third-party logistics provider and we ingredient supplier
and so far there have be no impact in they facility in production and we ability to meet demand
we be in the early stage of this stepped-up inventory on key skus
so we typically be run about call it 5 to 6 week of inventory in we own warehouse for key skus about of we top skus
we start move we inventory position closer to 8 week and we will be continue to monitor that and continue to move that up
in some instance we will go to 10 week of inventory just to give ourselves some safety stock in the event of a spike in demand from a retail standpoint
we be able to get that because we have be in communication very early on in the process
we be able to get that available capacity pretty easily
again I have complete confidence in they preparedness in the robustness of the supply_chain and we ability to flow goods ingredient to co-man to we third-party warehouse and to customer smoothly
so it be be we top priority
we be on it very early
and so far we supply_chain have respond wonderfully to the situation
Great
and can I follow up with a question on promotional activity
I think you allude to the idea that you might be pull back on that go forward
when might that kick in
and do you anticipate a increase in realize pricing as a result over the next few month
yes terrific question
these be this be less about we pull back
it be more about retailer change they priority
so as you can imagine they be deal with operational issue in they store to keep the store stock and try to keep social distancing so the number of employee in the store while consumer be shop
you be see those behavior a number of retailer announce the number of people that could be in the store at any one time
some retailer be actually have traffic pattern in the store in order to minimize interaction between they employee and other shopper
so the retail operational impact of the situation be for some retailer to prioritize that over promotion and even shelf reset
so I would say it be too early for we to understand the impact of that
I think it be reasonable to believe some retailer will delay shelf reset some retailer will push out promotion event to focus on in stock shelf and safety and security of shopper
hard for we to know that
I do think it be reasonable to believe we be not go to be we probably be not go to spend most of we trade spend that we have originally plan simply because customer will pull back event and then and those money will go unused
we next question come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs
sorry
I think in the response to last question Joe be talk about take inventory from $ 5 million to $ 6 million up to somewhere in the $ 8 million to $ 10 million range
it sound like that could have a bit of a impact on cash balance just give the work capital need
in that context where do you think you will land at net debt by the end of fiscal ' 20
yes
so that impact in the short term probably have about a $ 10 million to $ 15 million cash flow impact
I would like to think by the end of the fiscal year we can wind a good chunk of that down
but obviously it depend on how the COVID situation play_out over the next few month
not a big impact on we goal of or less on the leverage
still confident we will be below that target as of now
we obviously have some lever to pull from a cash flow perspective on Joe just mention trade
obviously with no travel go on we will have some G&A savings here in the back half of the_year
so feel much more comfortable try to predict cash_flow and to some extent ebitda than sale just give what be go_on in the marketplace right_now but very confident on the leverage
so and that be kind of what I be go to back into
I be try to reverse engineer effectively where you be still expect ebitda to be
and it sound like you ebitda expectation be not change materially it be just the sale volatility
so in that context I imagine you have map out sort of bull bear base type scenario or worst case best case type scenario and the various offset that would allow you to manage cash and ebitda in each
do you feel like you have adequately stress-test on both end of the range
and do you feel confident in the leverage ratio on either end
we do
obviously whether this thing be go to last 3 month or longer hard to tell
hopefully it be not hopefully it will be even shorter than that
but we have we be in the process of do a lot of stress test right_now
again we do have some lever to pull on the cost side
we will be smart both from a short term and a long-term perspective on those cost lever but we should be very good on leverage
okay
and then the last question just on okay go ahead
sorry
well Jason one other point
as you think about consumer shelter at home and the influence of marketing pressure you really start challenge how much marketing dollar you should be spend and how truly effective they be
so we will be look at we marketing investment level
I totally expect we to see a falloff in return on investment
and I would expect we to pull back on marketing actually keep some powder dry from when people see we be not get a return for that spending
we be go to pull back
we will keep we powder dry and that provide we even more financial flexibility go forward
but I think you accurately reflect we sentiment
a lot of volatility on shopping which drive some volatility on revenue but we have a fair amount of dry powder from a ebitda standpoint
yes that make a lot of sense
and as you mention as people shelter at home marketing may be less responsive
behavior may also be different too
can you remind we what percentage of you consumption occasion you believe fall in the meal replacement versus snack
yes
I do not think we accurately know that because we do not have that datum
I do not completely understand how much be meal replacement versus snacking
there be a fair portion of we business that be snack only
and so I think we be go to see again as I mention a increase in snack behavior and probably fewer occasion on meal replacement
the other thing to think through which be I think be really important be the consumer benefit that we offer in we brand weight management and active nutrition probably a little less relevant from a consumer standpoint during time of confinement
that say I think healthy snacking will continue to be relevant to folk as they be in they home
but I think the weight management benefit and kind of active nutrition when we just those be less relevant to we
that have some impact on consumption go forward
that say look we be really confident in we business after we emerge out of this
we be go to make the right decision in the short term for we business for we employee and for we community
and then we feel really confident in we ability once this crisis end and we business will be right back on track
we next question come from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo
I guess first off Joe look at the Quest business obviously the specialty channel have be weak already
and now with the store closure that number fall harder as you allude
what be you see in term of the pickup in e-commerce maybe be able to offset those decline
any datum you can share thus far about any channel shift
yes
just on Quest or the entire company
Quest
Quest
as you just step back this have be go_on for a number of year
Quest 's growth in food drug mass and then online have more than offset the decline in the specialty channel
I think with this crisis specialty channel will accelerate
the good news there be for we be that it be as a percent of we total business decline pretty significantly versus the last few year
so we be reasonably comfortable that channel shift be go to continue
this may accelerate a little bit
but we be in a good position in those other channel to pick up those fast
okay great
and then to follow up one of the pushback that we get on the investment case for simple be a degree of uncertainty as to how long the Atkins brand can grow how long the Rob Lowe messaging can work
but when you look at COVID and you hear about the more severe case be associate with obesity diabetes it would seem to reinforce the low-sugar low-carb messaging
and as you reference the r&d pipeline in you comment I be curious as you sit back do you think COVID open new opportunity where you expand the low-carb portfolio into new category
do you have any household panel datum or any anecdote about health scare be positive for low-carb demand
just how be you think about thing on the other side of COVID from a demand perspective maybe
yes
great question
and the one observation the low-carb diet high-protein low-carb diet be beneficial from a stress standpoint beneficial from a immunity standpoint
so I think people that I think all those thing that have be drive we business from a megatrend standpoint around health and wellness obesity diabetes will continue to be relevant and in time when people be concern about they health will continue to be relevant
so we feel really good about how we brand be position from a health and wellness standpoint
for those that kind of push back on how long can we grow this business I would just point out that it be be 11 year now compound annual growth rate of 13 % on Atkins
the category be still massively underpenetrated a lot of opportunity a lot of white space from a consumer target standpoint
so we be again really confident that the megatrend once we come out of this crisis will continue and we ability to continue to capture those consumer open to low-carb and protein-rich will continue to be there for we
and it be back by science
it be a trend that be continue for a lot of year and we be reasonably comfortable in we ability to continue to grow household penetration
and frankly this will just teach we that health and wellness be important to we
good immunity be important to we so to people and that be go to continue to be beneficial
we next question come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank
so I just want to you touch on this a little bit during the call but I want to talk more about what you be see from various category point of view
we do not have full March datum at this point and we kind of saw the uptake across the board through datum that we do have through March 21
but I be wonder if you could talk a little bit more about which category be you see the most volatility versus the most slowdown
and then which category do you think be most easily transferable to e-commerce
so I understand what when you talk about category what be you refer to
be you refer to
yes
I just mean sort of shake bar
form
okay
yes yes yes
okay
yes
the reason I ask that be we do not consider those category right
there be we look at the category organization around consumer need state
so broadly we think about it as nutritious snack sport active performance and kind of weight management
those be the segment that we see
as we move as shopping behavior after the 20th and 21st decline kind of double digit the category broadly move with the foot traffic
so that be what we experience after the 21st
within those segment of the category the category segment that be in the health and beauty aisle namely sport and active and weight management see more falloff than nutritious snack which be in center of store
but we believe that again that category center of store that be where Kind that be where Clif be right they be in the center of the shopping area with shopper come in get in the center of store and get out of the store whereas pharmacy HABA we see just less foot traffic
I think that be the phenomenon that be go_on at least be go_on towards the end of March as we move into April
really purchase behavior drive by shop behavior
and the reason we be pretty confident that that be the case if you look at both of we e-commerce business spike and have stay strong since the crisis start
so we see a significant uptick in we Quest business
by the way Amazon be its largest customer 15 % of they business come from Amazon
they see a significant spike in the business on Amazon across all they product and it be continue to be strong
and again on top of kind of 60 % growth on we Atkins business on online we spike above that after the restriction start to take place
so again strong growth in the business where shopping be clearly not the issue right
so I think right_now we be see purchase less about the form almost less about the consumer benefit much more about where it be in the store and how people be shop
and online yes online we business be strong across the board
so every form include shake we be see significant growth
so not impact by form
get it
just one quick follow-up
just go back to the supply_chain
I know historically you have talk about how you be kind of as you talk to you co-packer you be kind of put in certain order relative to where you expect sale will be
and to the extent that you diverge from that there can be incremental cost associate with that
sort of be there any framing that you can give we where I do not know sale be up x percent like that might have what the cost impact of that might be
so far we have not see a cost impact
we be very early in the stage
just to give you a example we go few day after that
so we be early on this
we be early in communicate with we supplier and we be early in increase order on key item
so we grab a lot of available capacity early in the process not with really a significant no significant uptick in cost
we have see a little bit of extra cost in we warehouse operation mainly drive by make sure that we the employee in those operation continue to come to work
there be a lot of pressure in the area for other distribution company look to try to get employee to come into they place
so we have be pay bonus that have be helpful in we make sure that we have the employee necessary to get product out the door
but Todd do you have any other comment
we have not experience any uptick at all in cost of goods
yes very nominal at this point
look as we point out on the call we be look at this very strategically
if we have to pay a little bit more in the_future to make sure we have product in we warehouse and we customer shelf we be more than willing to do that
we have not see that yet
so hopefully that will not be trade over the next couple of month
but so far very very little
yes
I would remind you too a year ago we see a pretty significant uptick in bar demand
we be able to get that extra supply
we really do not have any increase in cost in order to get that extra supply
so the good news be that we be a big manufacturer right
we have large volume and we offer a long run when a contract manufacturer make we product
so we be somebody that they will actually want to have more business with
so if we be get we demand in we requirement in pretty early they be happy to meet those need if they have get surplus capacity
and so far that capacity be available
at this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Joe Scalzo for close comment
yes

today we will discuss some highlight from we second quarter but a complete discussion of we second quarter result please refer to the press_release we issue earlier today and we 10-q for the period end February 29 , 2020 which we file with the SEC this afternoon
today we be go to talk mostly about the global health crisis cause by the covid-19 outbreak and its impact on we business
we currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relate to this global health crisis and its effect on both we company and the global economy
Jay and I be at the helm of wd-40 company during the global financial crisis in
together with we tribe we successfully navigate those difficult time and the company emerge stronger than when we enter
we realize that the difficult time we be encounter during the fiscal crisis be very different from the one we be face today
we be in a health crisis which be impact all part of the globe and affect economy worldwide
as a result the outcome be very difficult to predict
I have again confirm in my mind that people be okay at deal with risk that struggle with uncertainty
and while it be true that there be a lot we do not know today there be some thing we do know
we do know the health crisis be go to be a temporary disruptive to we business and that we will likely be some short-term negative impact on we financial result
we know that we will probably face some challenge in the come week and month as we continue to operate a global business through these volatile and uncertain time
however despite all this we also know that we be go to get through this
we have a strong tribe who be dedicate to we brand and to we end user
we have a famous brand that people can trust and which can bring certainty to both we customer and we end user in these uncertain time
we remain committed to make we product easy to buy which be demonstrate by they availability in over unique trade channel
we have a loyal end-user base in more than country and territory around the world
we have act to further bulletproof we balance_sheet thanks to the great work do by Jay and the finance team over the last couple of week
for all these reason I be sure we be well position to navigate the storm as it unfold from both a financial and operational perspective
this too will pass
now let 's talk about we long-term growth aspiration
as a reminder we long-term growth aspiration be guidepost not guidance and they be probably wrong and roughly right
we long-term growth aspiration be to drive consolidated net sale to approximately $ 700 million and to do this while follow we business model
we long-term target be still very clear to we
however with the uncertain global economy ahead the timing of we aspiration may be delay
during the_second_quarter except for the Asia Pacific segment we long-term strategic driver continue to perform mostly in line with we expectation
let 's talk about the strategic initiative number one be to grow the wd-40 multi-use product
we goal under this initiative be to grow wd-40 multi-use product to approximately $ 530 million in revenue
in the_second_quarter sale of wd-40 multi-use product be $ 76 million down 3 % compare to last_year
this decline be drive primarily by a 37 % decline in Asia Pacific which be partially offset by increase sale in the Americas and EMEA up 7 % and 1 % respectively
the decline in wd-40 multi-use product sale in Asia Pacific be drive primarily by a 74 % decline in sale of wd-40 multi-use product in China due to the disruption relate to the covid-19 outbreak
as you know in China many distribution channel and factory be close and the greater population be place in quarantine for several week start in mid-January
these factor materially impact we sale during the_second_quarter since we have a significant number of order that be schedule to ship to we customer in early February after Chinese New Year Holiday and those shipment could not take place due to the covid-19 outbreak in the country
however in recent week we have see factory start to commence production and people begin go back to work
thing be slowly return to normal for we tribe member in China
everyone be back to work though some tribe member be still work remotely
Schools remain closed in many area of China
so this month we have some little tribe member in the Shanghai office who have accompany they parent to work
we be happy to support this temporary working arrangement
we expect we will encounter volatility and disruption in other region where we global business operate due to the global health crisis
Strategic initiative number two grow the wd-40 specialist product line
we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for wd-40 specialist and believe we can grow the product line to approximately $ 100 million in revenue
in the_second_quarter sale of wd-40 specialist increase 10_% to $ 8.9 million compare to last_year
we continue to move forward with we new packaging that we discuss with you last quarter which we believe will give we a stronger brand presence for both wd-40 multi-use product and wd-40 specialist align they as the blue and yellow brand with a little red top
Strategic initiative number three broaden product and revenue base
Strategic initiative number three include maintenance product like 3-in-one wd-40 bike and gt85 but also include home care brand such as Spot Shot and Lava in the Americas in EMEA and no vac and solvol in Asia Pacific
we goal for the product under this initiative be to reach a combined revenue of approximately $ 70 million
global sale of the product include under this initiative be $ 12.8 million in the_second_quarter up 2 % compare to last_year
Strategic initiative number four attract develop and retain outstanding tribe member
we be put the health safety and well-being of we tribe member and they family first during these difficult time with shelter in place order in effect in most of the country where we tribe member live and work many of they have be exclusively work from home for several week now
we it team around the world have do a exceptional job ensure that everyone have the technology they need to complete they job remotely
we call ourselves a tribe because we be a community of people with a shared purpose that be to help feed and defend each other
during these difficult time I think that definition be particularly fitting
there be no better time than now to have a highly engage workforce
during the_second_quarter we take we biannual employee engagement survey and I be happy to report that we overall global employee engagement score remain the envy of many organization at 93 %
Strategic initiative number five operational excellence
the world be full of volatility ambiguity and uncertainty more so now than I and other have ever see in we lifetime
it be we commitment to maintain we operational excellence which will help see we through the storm just as it have in other time of macroeconomic uncertainty
from a financial perspective we be in a enviable position
we have always maintain a strong balance_sheet and manage we fund wisely
that complete the update of the strategic driver
I would now pass the call to Steve who will discuss some operational highlight
thanks Garry and good afternoon
I hope that you be all well during these challenging time
the impact of the global health crisis on we operation represent a unprecedented challenge that we be evaluate and address daily
therefore today rather than go through net sale result for the_second_quarter I would like to talk with you about what be happen right_now
for detail about we second quarter operational result please refer to the press_release we issue earlier today
as you know the situation be dynamic and change every day so I will not be give any number or any future projection just a high-level summary of what we know today
what I can share with you be that in March despite the enormous disruption experience in many country due to covid-19 revenue level be in line with what we have historically see in a typical March
while this be good news I want to stress that the_future remain uncertain
first a bit about we supply_chain
as most of you know we outsource the manufacturing of we finish product to contract manufacturer all around the world
many of we contract manufacturer have be trust partner for so long they be consider part of the tribe
therefore one of we top priority be to ensure we business partner stay safe and healthy
all we partner be follow the recommendation set forth by govern agency and be take necessary precaution to ensure the safety of they employee
we supply_chain be structure such that wd-40 company product be source manufacture and warehouse as close to we customer and end user as possible
because we predominantly source and manufacture we product locally we expect we will be able to minimize much of the supply chain risk we will encounter during the current health crisis
however I want to emphasize that each of we region be be impact by they own set of local challenge and a increasingly constrain supply chain environment
in Europe the region most negatively impact by in March by the covid-19 outbreak we supply_chain be able to produce 95 % of we normal aerosol production despite severe limitation on movement
that be a wonderful testament to the resilience of we partner as well as to the hard work of we supply chain tribe
in addition in EMEA we have build up some buffer inventory to be use in the event of a hard Brexit
so unforeseen this extra inventory be come in very useful to help we mitigate the supply chain disruption we be encounter in EMEA
the additional work capital that we invest be timely and will help mitigate some of the risk associate with the current crisis
in the Americas we aerosol line continue to be operational and we be not experience any significant impact to we supply_chain thus far
this have not be without considerable effort by tribe member who have pivot many time to address issue as they have arise over the past several week
we be closely monitor we global supply_chain and we supply chain tribe member be work hard around the world to ensure that raw material be obtain production line be function order be fulfil and customer and end user be get the product they need
now let 's talk briefly about we tribe
currently tribe member in location around the world be under mandatory work-from-home order
we have location where tribe member have the option to work from home but be not mandate
only one wd-40 company office in the world be open and that be in Shanghai today
as Garry mention earlier thing be start to return to normal in China
we expect the next several week will be challenge for we tribe member all around the world but the tribe 's experience in China give we some hope that we will see the other side of this health crisis soon
we tribe member in China have be a wonderful resource as they have be able to share they health crisis learn moment with the rest of we
finally some good news
as you know at wd-40 company we play the infinite game
we be a financially strong company and we take a long-term view
I be happy to be able to share some good news with you today
first we be transition from a marketing distributor arrangement to a direct model in Mexico
we have recently hire new tribe member and have open a new office in the city of Monterrey
put the foundation of we new direct market in place have be underway for a very long time
I want to thank the tribe member who have work tirelessly to make this happen
we be thrill to share that in May we will begin to service we mexican customer on a direct basis wd-40 multi-use product and 3-in-one be # 1 and # 2 brand in they category in Mexico
we believe by transition to the direct model we will be able to generate both faster top line growth as well as stronger gross margin over time
second e-commerce be the fastest-growing retail channel in the world today and it be we fastest-growing channel as well
2 year ago we commit to we global vision of become the category leader in digital and e-commerce and we continue to make outstanding progress in this area
year-to-date e-commerce sale globally grow by 44 % compare to last_year
we have also recently appoint a Chief Digital Adviser from a lead consultancy who will work with we global tribe to continue we journey towards become global leader in the digital space in we category
with of the world 's population observe stay-at - home order we be see what we believe be a seismic shift in online behavior and one that we believe may lead to a permanent behavioral shift in buy pattern
wd-40 company be well position to benefit from the significant change in the landscape
in addition we be learn from the recent experience we have in China
while year-to-date sale in China decline by 52 % due to the health crisis e-commerce sale increase 39 % over the same period
now I will turn the call over to Jay for a update on the financial
thank you Steve
today we report net sale of $ 100 million for the_second_quarter of_fiscal year_2020 down 1 % compare to the second quarter of last year
translation of we foreign subsidiary result from they functional currency to the U.S. dollar a slight favorable impact on sale in the_second_quarter
on a constant currency basis sale would have be $ 99.7 million down 2 % compare to last_year
net income for the_second_quarter be $ 14.3 million a decrease of 10_% compare to last_year
and diluted earnings per share for the_second_quarter be $ 1.04 compare to $ 1.14 for the same period last_year
and from a financial perspective we be in a enviable position with a very strong balance_sheet and a newly amend $ 150 million credit facility from which we recently elect to draw down $ 80 million to further strengthen we liquidity position
we be focus on manage through this crisis to come out the other side as a much stronger business
let 's start with a quick discussion about we business model the long-term target that we use to guide we business
on today 's call I be go to focus primarily on the driver for gross margin
in the_second_quarter we gross margin be 53.6 % compare to 55.4 % last_year
this represent a decline of basis_point
the major driver of this decline be sale mix change higher warehousing and freight and other miscellaneous cost
impact from sale mix change and other miscellaneous cost in all trading bloc negatively impact we gross margin by basis_point compare to the prior year period
the unfavorable impact in the Americas and EMEA be primarily due to unfavorable shift in product and customer mix as well as higher miscellaneous cost
in Asia Pacific shortfall in sale in China a direct market where we typically have higher gross margin negatively impact the overall margin for Asia Pacific
in addition higher warehousing and inbound freight primarily in EMEA negatively impact we gross margin by basis_point
change in major input cost negatively impact we margin by basis_point
petroleum-based specialty chemical positively impact we margin by basis point period over-period
however increase cost of aerosol can negatively impact we margin by basis_point and more than offset the gain we realize due to lower specialty chemical cost
finally change in foreign currency exchange rate negatively impact we gross margin by basis_point
these negative impact to gross margin be offset by the favorable effect of price increase and lower discount to we customer which when combine positively impact gross margin by basis_point in the_second_quarter
now let 's talk a little bit more about oil
recently crude oil have plunge to multiyear low
fall crude oil price will most likely be a net positive to we gross margin
however it be extremely difficult to know the long-term impact of these change until we see it in we cost of goods sell which will take some time
this be because we do not buy crude oil we instead buy custom-formulated petroleum-based specialty chemical which have complex cost driver include the manufacturing region fix production cost and distinctive supply and demand characteristic
in addition since the global petroleum market be base on the U.S. dollar when the price of oil fall the dollar often strengthen
and for product manufacture in country outside the U.S. this can leave cost in other currency much higher
overall we estimate only a small amount of the total cost to produce a can of the wd-40 multi-use product directly correlate to the price of a barrel of crude oil
if oil stay here at current level for a considerable amount of time we will likely begin to see a benefit in we cost of goods in about 90 to 120 day
now a word about we balance_sheet and we capital allocation strategy
the company 's financial condition and liquidity remain strong
we believe we efficient business model and the recent step we have take to strengthen we balance_sheet give we position to manage we business through this crisis as it continue to unfold
in March we amend we line of credit with the Bank of America to extend the maturity date to and to increase the revolving commitment to $ 150 million
at the end of March we have borrow a additional $ 80 million on the revolving line of credit bring the balance to approximately $ 149 million
though we be already fairly well capitalize we decide to exercise a abundance of caution and draw on the remain balance of we line of credit to ensure liquidity and manage potential risk during this time of unprecedented macroeconomic uncertainty
if no need arise for these additional fund as we weather this storm we will simply repay the debt and restore we available credit
in addition to these step we have elect to suspend the stock purchase we have be make under we current share buyback plan
we be do this in order to preserve cash until we have a better idea of the long-term financial impact of this crisis
we continue to return capital to we shareholder through regular dividend
on March 17 we Board of director approve a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.67 per share payable to shareholder of record on the close of business April 17
in fiscal year_2020 we expect to complete we investment of approximately $ 30 million in capital project primarily to procure the proprietary machinery and equipment we need to manufacture we next generation smart straw delivery system
with everything thing go_on in the world we believe invest in we future be more important now than ever before
so with that let 's turn to fiscal year_2020 guidance
the covid-19_pandemic have inject a measure of uncertainty into we business which make it very difficult for we to accurately forecast short-term financial result for the company
therefore today we be withdraw the fiscal year_2020 guidance which we last reiterate on January 9
we be continue to monitor the situation closely and we will update you when we can
and that complete the financial overview
now I will turn it back to Garry
thanks Jay
in summary what do you hear from we on this call
you hear that we China subsidiary be materially impact by the covid-19 outbreak during the_second_quarter
more importantly you hear that thing be slowly return to normal for we tribe member in China
you hear that we expect we will continue to encounter volatility and disruption in the region where we global business operate due to the global health crisis
you hear that we employee engagement score remain the envy of many organization at 93 %
you hear that we be transition from a marketing distributor arrangement to a direct business model in Mexico
you hear that we continue to make outstanding progress in the area of digital and e-commerce and that e-commerce sale have grow 44 % year-to-date compare to last_year
you hear that we elect to make change to we line of credit agreement and recently draw down a significant rainy day fund from this line to bulletproof we balance_sheet
you hear that we be suspend purchase under we current share buyback plan in order to preserve cash that we continue to return capital to we investor through dividend
you hear that we withdraw we previously issue fiscal year 2020 earnings guidance due to the rapidly evolve impact of the global health crisis
you hear that we be confident we long-term growth aspiration remain a realistic opportunity
in closing I would like to share with you a quote from my friend Simon Sinek remain calm in time of desperation make way for opportunity
thank you for join we today
please stay safe
we would be please now to open the conference_call to you question
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- you first question come from Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson
so I guess I be most strike by Steve 's comment that March be similar to previous March result
so I guess you be kind of say that sale be flattish not significantly down
I find that hard to believe give that we have have a suspension of almost all nonessential manufacturing in the United_States in other country
so can you just kind of give we a little more color
and also we have have a lot of investor ask we about a breakdown of you demand by end market
so like how much be automotive how much would be high tech manufacturing different end-market demand
do you think you could give a little color on all of that
thanks Linda
we be please with be able to hold up in March
and I guess it do really reflect on we multiple trade channel multiple country business strategy
as far as trade channel be concern I will ask Steve just to give a high-level view of the key channel that we operate in
sure
thanks Garry
so as Garry say I mean one of the big advantage of wd-40 company be that we be diversified both by trade channel and by geography
so no one trade channel customer or geography be we be not overly reliant
the biggest market we operate in we automotive DIY hardware e-commerce as we mention on the call be a fast-growing channel both in term of percentage growth and also dollar volume so and a industry as well be the one of the big
and but the beauty be the diversification
and so no one of those trade channel have a overbearing weight on the overall revenue
so do you expect I mean be you see anything in you end market that indicate that because the decline in China be quite significant
so be it just the rest of the world be slower in see the impact in regard covid-19 in China
I can give you some color on that Linda
the down what happen in China be due to a plan shipment that we have that be to go out to we customer straight after chinese new year
we have a substantial order book in place
and as be customary China kind of wait till after chinese New year to renew themselves and to take on that inventory
and so if the COVID have not happen we would have ship those order
so it be not a end user a demand issue it be we inability to ship that cause the sudden downturn in China
China start the shutdown around January 17 and be outright through till well into February and we do not we be not able to ship what we have
we be start to ship those order now
so that be why there be a difference between China
if you think about in the world right_now most of the dominant trade channel that we operate in be function hardware home improvement grocery club mass merchant those trade channel be operate albeit at a different level
so people be buy
I drive past my local home improvement store this_morning and the parking lot be 75 % full
people be go there to buy a product probably wd-40 as well
so there be different thing that go_on between China and what be happen in the U.S.
okay
that be a good explanation
so can you talk about just you innovation that you be plan to launch
I think it be you be talk about June or July
be you go to delay that or be you still go to launch you major innovation
we be still go ahead
you be refer to Smart Straw or smart Straw next generation
the first market to launch that will be Canada in June
and we be also move ahead with the continued conversion of we specialist product range into the new blue and yellow red top trade dress from we brand architecture
and we will continue to work on the rollout of smart Straw next generation around the world
it will probably take we 18 month in total to get it out there as it be in the_past but no we be full steam ahead
okay
and then just finally in term of the gross margin I guess relative to at least my estimate it be kind of disappointing in the_quarter
and you mention I think mix issue be quite a big issue
it seem like in many quarter mix seem to be a issue
and I be just wonder be the idea that you be continue to shift people toward the Smart Straw and Specialist which be a higher-margin product
be that still occur
and then if so what be these I do not know it seem like almost like a recur issue with mix that impact you gross margin
okay
I will touch some of it and I will give it to Jay if I can
the mix issue in this_quarter be the shortfall of sale in China
we have a higher gross margin in China
and because we sale fall into the gutter there completely that be the issue
Jay I will pass on to you for the rest
yes
thanks Garry
yes Linda that be a lot of what happen be in we direct the other be the depend on the volume in any given period that go through those distribution channel
so we md market we marketing distributor market have a quite a bit lower margin as a whole we direct market have a much higher margin
and then when we see mix between there be also even mix between market
so for example there be much higher-margin in Europe than there be in the U.S. base on just the sophistication of the distribution channel and the size of the market
okay
and can I just sneak in one last one
go back to look at you financial result back in the last recession in the ' 08 period I think it be a 8 % sale decline if I be not mistaken
so you do have a sale decline
I know you do not want to give guidance you be withdraw you guidance
but would it be a bad idea for conservative analyst to put something like a 8 % decline or something like that assume we go into a recession
I will let Jay answer that
Linda the decline that be you mention for be primarily because of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound
it devalue some 25 % I think in
and I think right_now it would be irresponsible for we to try and predict the_future until we get through what we have to get through now
I think we will have a better idea once the world start to ramp up again
so but in the U.S. in we sale go sideways
we consolidated revenue go down but that be because of the change in the exchange rate from the british pound
right Jay
yes
actually we have a shortfall in the U.S.
we actually in local currency or in-source currency we be we have growth in EMEA but it be wipe out because of the headwind from foreign currency exchange
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- we next question come from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies
I get cut off at the end of the prepared remark
so forgive I if this have already say but do you indicate that the dividend be largely intact that you be not consider cut that at this point
no
yes we do issue a dividend
the Board declare a dividend and we excuse I we will issue a dividend at the end of the month
right
but I be say go forward in the second half of the_year give the uncertain outlook
that we make those dividend decision on a quarterly basis
I mean we policy have not really change and that be we look first to pay a dividend out at 50_% of we earnings and that strategy continue
okay
and then Garry you mention see in you local distribution channel that thing be still go you channel be still relatively intact there and I assume that be with the home improvement market
but I be wonder if you be see similar thing with both the construction commercial and then just industrial activity give the lack of commercial and industrial activity and auto activity I be wonder I would assume that you be see significant decline in those distribution channel or the channel through those end market
Daniel we be not see it yet
it be probably too early but let I say this construction be at least in California have be designate as a essential service
as I drive around I see truck out builder out auto repair store be still open
the auto industry in itself in the manufacturing side I do not think that be huge consumption but people be fix car the auto zone O'Reillys the brake part area the oil change people they be all operating
so stuff be get do at this time
okay
that be actually very helpful
and then final question
you indicate that the CapEx I think be go to be at $ 30 million this_year
we assume be I right to model that start next year it go back more towards a traditional level
or be it go to stay at this kind of elevated level as you guy continue to roll thing out
Jay
we would expect it to go back to very close to historical level
once we complete the project with the innovation around we next-generation Smart Straw we do not have any other significant investment that be beg for a lot of capital
be that project expect to be complete this_year
it will be there will be some carryover into ' 21 , fy ' 21

we thank you for you participation on today 's conference_call and ask that you please disconnect you line

thank you Adam and thanks to everyone for join the workiva first quarter 2020 conference call
we heart go out to the people directly affect by covid-19 and we be grateful for the essential worker we can to protect we employee and they family during this difficult time
we be grateful that all of we employee be able to work from home and that we be able to fully compensate the small number of employee who do not have role outside of we physical office
to keep we team connect and focus I host a weekly live stream q&a to offer update insight advice and support to all employee
as a cloud-based technology company with a highly distribute workforce the shift to work from home have be smooth for we
with cloud platform and digital channel it be be mostly business as usual
we continue to deliver the highest level of performance availability and security
we technology global infrastructure and operating model along with we customer support enable we customer to work from home in a controlled secure environment with they most sensitive datum
this ability to work from anywhere be become the new baseline
we believe that Workiva will be a key player in this broad-based shift to remote work which will drive increase demand for we reporting and compliance platform for year to come
workiva enter this global crisis from a position of financial strength
we believe we be in a stronger more flexible financial position now than ever before include nearly $ 500 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investment
we be pleased with we first quarter financial result which exceed guidance for revenue and operating result
however like many other company the month of March deliver some unprecedented challenge as we see a number of customer and prospects delay software purchase
in March we restrict nonessential business travel and we transition to all virtual sale meeting even though we traditional sale process have be disrupt
in many case we be find it easier to access people and we be have engage conversation with customer and prospects
in fact most of the company that delay first quarter purchase be back in we pipeline
Stuart Miller we CFO will provide more detail about we financial result later in the call
in time of rapid change we commitment to each other and we customer remain the same
Workiva be drive by we value which sustain we in these uncertain time
we be a strong resourceful company and we be move forward stay focus on we goal and objective
we continue to execute on we growth vector which include EMEA Wdata and we platform solution for integrate risk global statutory reporting and the U.S. government
and we be continue to hire people in the area where we see the most potential for growth
despite covid-19 we remain confident that Europe will comprise 25 % to 30 % of we total revenue over time
we recently launch a new solution to help mid-sized company comply with the european single electronic format commonly know as esef
we new solution offer limited functionality specifically for this market
because this solution reside on the workiva platform customer be able to upgrade to we more comprehensive esef solution and leverage additional platform capability at any time
we also plan to continue extend the capability of we platform into additional industry vertical
earlier this week we announce that we will be work with utility pipeline and other energy company many of which be exist customer automate datum integration and streamline report to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission know as FERC
last June FERC adopt XBRL as its report standard
with we connected reporting platform and we leadership in XBRL Workiva be ideally position to capture this market
in response to covid-19 we shift all marketing activity to virtual channel
as a result we annual Amplify user conference will be host virtually later this year
in March we 2-day virtual event amplify go be attend by nearly customer prospects and partner and be we largest event to date
I want to thank we amazing employee for they ongoing dedication and commitment to deliver we platform and support we customer and partner around the world
with that let I turn it over to Stuart Miller we CFO
thank you Marty
I will comment on we financial position review we business model and then explain at a high level why we beat we q1 guidance
next I will discuss q1 result versus q1 last_year and finish with forward guidance
we believe Workiva be well positioned financially to weather the storm from covid-19
indeed we believe Workiva have never have a stronger or more flexible financial position than we do now
at March 31 Workiva have $ 496 million of unrestricted cash and short-term investment
the first maturity on we funded debt occur in more than 6 year
we debt obligation have no restrictive financial covenant
we believe we business model mitigate many of the challenge pose by covid-19 for reason first demand for we solution be relatively insulate from the business cycle
Software to assist larger enterprise with regulatory compliance and performance management be need in both good time and bad
second we cloud-based platform be design for team member to collaborate remotely include those who work from home
on-premise system can not compete as well in this environment
Third we enjoy high revenue retention rate because we customer love the design and functionality of we software and the high-quality of we customer service
we platform save time reduce risk and eliminate many of the tedious aspect of financial and managerial reporting
we think we value proposition be compelling relative to alternative and the market we serve
fourth most of we customer pay we annually in advance for a subscription to we software platform
these contract renew fairly evenly among the 4 quarter of the year
as a result around 90 % of the subscription revenue we recognize every quarter come from defer revenue
Fifth no customer account for more than 1 % of we revenue
we largest customer account for less than 5 % of we revenue in the aggregate
Sixth the source of we revenue be diverse
but note to the financial in we 10-q break out revenue contribution by industry of we customer
shift now to we financial
as always I will talk about we result and guidance on a non-gaap basis
refer to we press_release for a reconciliation of we non-gaap and gaap result and guidance
I will talk about how well we do against guidance first
we beat q1 2020 revenue guidance at the midpoint by $ 2.75 million
higher subscription revenue account for about of the beat while higher service revenue contribute the balance
we beat guidance on q1 operating income by a relatively wide margin
I would like to explain the $ 8 million positive operating income swing at a high level
the revenue beat I just mention account for of the swing
expense account for the remain of the beat as follow travel and entertainment expense be just over $ 1 million better than forecast due to covid-19 travel restriction medical care expense be almost $ 1 million better than forecast due to postponement of discretionary medical visit from covid-19 restriction and a higher percentage of we employee elect the high deductible medical insurance plan sale commission expense be about $ 0.5 million better than forecast due primarily to a change in we sale commission structure fee pay to recruiter consultant and legal adviser be $ 0.5 million better than forecast
the remainder of the beat on q1 operating income just above $ 2 million come from a hire at a slower pace than forecast some of which be relate to covid-19
now turn to a comparison of q1 to q1 last_year
we generate total revenue in the_first_quarter of $ 85.8 million a increase of 22.6 % from q1
break out revenue by report line item subscription and support revenue be $ 68.4 million up 21.8 % from q1
New solution new logo and conversion to solution-based licensing help drive strong revenue growth in q1
56 % of the increase in s&s revenue in q1 come from exist customer
the balance of the increase come from new customer add in the last 12 month
professional service revenue be $ 17.4 million in q1 a increase of 26 % from the same quarter last year
growth be drive by help customer migrate to inline XBRL additional revenue and setup in consulting and organic xbrl growth
as a reminder the_first_quarter be seasonally the high point for we revenue from XBRL tag since most of we publicly trade customer prepare they 10-k in the_first_quarter
turn to we supplemental metric
we finish q1 with customer a net increase of customer from q1 and a net decrease of customer from q4
on a gross basis customer churn in q1 which be a normal level of churn for we and we add new logo in q1 which be below normal for we and be due to the impact of covid-19
in early March new deal in we pipeline carry we highest rating for a probability to close by month end
of the deal do close in March and return to the pipeline of which would have be new logo
normally a very high percentage of these type of deal would have close by month end
we revenue retention rate remain strong
we subscription and support revenue retention rate be 94.5 % for the first quarter of 2020 compare to 95.7 % for the same period last_year
almost half of the attrition in the_quarter come from M&A delisting and bankruptcy
look ahead we expect a higher incidence of bankruptcy and delisting
on the positive side we expect less pressure from M&A in the near term
with add-on we subscription and support revenue retention rate improve to 110.9 % for the first quarter of 2020 compare to 110.7 % in q1
we progress with larger subscription contract continue to be promising
the number of contract value at over $ 100,000 per year total in the first quarter of 2020 up 36 % from q1 of the_prior_year
the number of contract value at over $ 150,000 total customer in the_first_quarter up 49 % from q1 2019 result
move down to P&L
Gross profit total $ 64.3 million in q1 up 25.5 % from the same quarter a year ago
Consolidated gross margin be 74.9 % in the latest quarter versus 73.2 % in q1 a net expansion of basis_point
break out gross profit
subscription and support gross profit total $ 56.6 million equate to a gross margin of 82.9 % on s&s revenue a contraction of basis_point compare to q1
additional headcount to help upgrade customer to we next-generation platform be the primary driver of the contraction
professional service gross profit in the_first_quarter be $ 7.6 million equate to a 43.7 % gross margin compare to 32.7 % in q1 due to improve utilization
Research and development expense in q1 total $ 21.4 million up 6.5 % from q1 primarily due to higher compensation cost
r&d expense as a percentage of revenue improve to 25 % in q1 from 28.7 % in q1
sale and marketing expense for the_quarter increase 42.6 % from q1 to $ 33.4 million reflect we investment in sale talent primarily to drive booking in EMEA integrate risk global statutory reporting and U.S. government
General and administrative expense total $ 8.7 million in q1 up $ 1.9 million compare to q1
g&a expense as a percentage of revenue increase basis_point to 10.1 % due to additional headcount higher software expense and increase rent expense
we post a operating profit of $ 800,000 in q1 compare to a operating profit of $ 900,000 in q1 last_year
Workiva 's operating margin in q1 be substantially better than we guidance as I discuss earlier
turn to we balance_sheet and cash flow statement
at March 31 , 2020 cash cash equivalent and marketable security total $ 496 million a increase of $ 8.1 million compare to the balance at December 31 , 2019
in q1 net cash provide from operate activity total $ 4.7 million compare with cash provide of $ 5.1 million in the same quarter a year ago
at the end of each quarter we review outstanding invoice to determine which one present a collection risk due to a variety of factor include credit risk consistent with asc
we remove the invoice at risk take the amount out of both account receivable and deferred revenue until payment be collect which be when we begin to recognize revenue
at March 31 , 2020 we classify $ 6 million of receivables to this reserve account up $ 1.7 million from the reserve at year-end in anticipation of the impact of covid-19
the increase in this reserve account reduce defer revenue by a equal amount and therefore it reduce billing at the end of the quarter
remain performance obligation on subscription contract continue to vary from defer revenue as we implement multiyear contract with annual billing term for some customer
turn to we guidance
for the second quarter of 2020 we expect total revenue to range from $ 80.3 million to $ 80.8 million
we expect subscription revenue to grow at a rate in the low teens compare to
q2 last_year
we expect service revenue to show the normal seasonal decline from q1
and in addition we expect to post q2 service revenue below last_year 's q2 result
you may recall we have a onetime contribution to service revenue from a regulatory change in q2 last_year
we expect non-gaap operating loss to range from $ 6.8 million to $ 7.3 million in q2
the depth and duration of the economic disruption from covid-19 be unknown
while we have a large pipeline of new deal we have limit visibility on when the deal will close
so we be suspend specific guidance for full year_2020
however we be provide some directional guidance for the rest of the_year
relative to the guidance that we give in February we now expect full year 2020 revenue to grow at a slower pace and operate margin to improve
we will now take you question
operator we be ready to begin the q&a session
-lsb- operator_instruction -rsb- and you first question will come from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James
this be Alex Sklar on for Brian
Marty first one for you
this be in you prepared remark but can you just talk more about the resiliency of Workiva 's platform and a work-from-anywhere environment
and with that I think you talk about demand potentially pick up
be you already see that in the current environment catalyze greater number of conversation or lead
and then I have a follow-up for Stuart
yes
you phone be mute Marty
maybe I will pass one for Stuart here while
yes sorry Marty 's phone be mute
yes okay
go ahead
all right
well I guess just talk about the visibility on the backlog
the rpo growth this_quarter especially in light of the commentary you give on the March late stage pipeline
be there any reason from a workiva standpoint that you would not be able to implement or go live on any portion of that next 12-month balance
understand customer may ultimately push timing but just curious on you own ability to meet all that backlog
no I do not think there be any restriction from we perspective on that
most of the onboarding we do or virtually all the onboarding we do be remote anyway
do you hear I sorry
yes yes
and then do we lose Marty on the first question
yes
I think he be try to dial back in
I be sorry
say that again
okay
well maybe another one for you then Stuart
on the backlog growth it accelerate some even with the
even with the commentary yes the backlog growth accelerate on the full rpo not just the next 12 month one which be impressive I think give you be comp SBL last_year
I just be curious if you would call out any of you kind of 4 to 5 growth opportunity as have a outsized contribution
yes
I would say just to remind you on the RPO side some of the growth there be due to we signing 3 - year deal with 1 year to pay and so that be pick up the that be accelerate on the RPO side
but we do show good deal size growth in q1
next question be from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird
it be Matt Lemenager on for Rob
so the question be in the I guess it would be the deal that get push or I guess return to the pipeline be there any recur message or theme there
I realize it be covid-driven but it be not people the discretionary spend for maybe around CFO suite or accounting suite be kind of push to the back burner as kind of near-term other it trend take priority
or just kind of look be there any theme or message that happen in those deal that get push
let I see if Marty be not still on so I guess I will place
can you guy can anyone hear I now
yes we can now Marty
you want to take that one
yes
it be on the right line
they do not have I connect I be sorry because I could hear everything and same number
anyway I apologize everybody
back to the resiliency question the in when we start the company we be very much focus on cloud in the very early day and we say we be always go to make a 100 % web tool web and a cloud-based tool
and we have hear tremendous number of positive thing from we customer do this as they all move to work from home
I think some of they have already be do it but everyone be able to achieve what they need to in term of activity that they be actually do in we product
in term of see lead it be too early to say
we really I can not say for sure but we have see some uptick in definitely inquiry when a lot of we competitor have software that be on-prem
so it be early day but again I really believe that this will help we in the long run
Marty you want to comment on the Matt 's specific question about the logo the deal that go back into the pipeline
do you do you see any theme there on why they go back why they be postpone
well I would say this
the end of March everybody be in a state of shock and everyone be try to understand how it be go to affect they cash_flow
there be category to those from my perspective
one be industry that see a immediate drop in cash_flow like airline or even credit card company thing like that obviously hospitality those be put on hold indefinitely and we have several of those occur
the second category be very prudent cfo say hey let 's just put the brake on new deal anything we be spend that be new for the next or 3 month to see how this all shake out
and most of the stuff that we see slip be in that category where they be just be prudent in say let 's see what be go to happen
obviously none of we have ever see anything like this and how it affect the economy
that shock be sort of settle out now and we be start to see a lot of activity
so we be optimistic that thing be go to slowly come back to normal in term of we sale process
that be helpful Marty
and then my other question would just be on for you sale quota-carrying folk be you make any change to I do not know thing like expand the amount of quota they be require to carry just maybe assume some of the close rate will not be as high and so kind of to get to the number we think maybe at the initial plan that people need to carry more quota
or any change around that to kind of sale go-to-market
no not yet
this be 2 month old
we be 2 month we be into this
and so we be we be not go to do anything knee jerk
we be watch what be happen
we be happy with we pipeline right_now
but again no one 's be through anything like this
so we just do not know how it be go to play_out
but we do not have any plan to make any dramatic change to we sale team or the size of they patch or we quota
you next question be from the line of Terry Tillman with SunTrust Robinson
I do appreciate also the extra color that you all add this_quarter as it relate to the sale activity and pipeline
so that be helpful
I appreciate it
first question just relate to you all have a announcement a couple of week ago as it relate to sale leadership change Scott Ryan leave or resign
it look like Julie be take over more responsibility
so what I be curious be if we could just learn a little bit more about the decision-making and what catalyze that
and I think in that press_release it talk about broader sale leadership change and a focus on sale efficiency
so would just love some more color on what exactly happen and kind of the driver of it
sure
if you recall when I get the CEO title here a little over 1.5 year ago I be the act Chief Operating Officer at the time
and that happen rather abruptly and we know that eventually we want a new COO
that be what we want
and so this be sort of the manifestation of go back to that traditional model of have a coo and not a Chief revenue Officer
and a company we size clearly do not need both
the second thing be we bring Scott in to really upgrade we be a transactional company smaller deal size
and we really bring he in to bring we up that deal size ladder in term of the talent sale process and the skill of the seller
and he do a good job of get we substantial improvement there
he also bring in a lot of other manager and help bring some of we other manager up the learning curve and also bring in a leader for service when he be CRO
and then when Julie come in and sort of get she leg we realize that it be we have one extra layer and really do not need both title
at the same time Scott have say that he have be in the sale leadership job a long time want to take a short break and maybe look for another company where he could do the same type of thing he do for we
so we it be a joint agreement to have he move on and we work out a joint deal
and we be not replace he as we mention
a couple of other sale leader also be leave the company and we feel we have a very lean and very good sale management team now
we really do not need the excess layer
but Scott really bring we along to a good place and it be a good time in term of be efficient at the top of the org
okay
and I guess Stuart a follow-up question just relate to the 111 % revenue retention in the_quarter
for 2q kind of any perspective directionally on how to think about that
and even for the full year again
I know you be not give guidance for the full year
but just how to think or what would be a base case for a revenue retention as you see it
so as you indicate we do not give guidance on that number
it be as you know it be a buildup that include add-on solution and price increase and it be net of solution churn
so we be please with the number that we post in q1 and we be please with the pipeline of new deal both new logo and add-on sale
and as we indicate we do not have visibility on when those deal be go to close
as I indicate in my remark second quarter we have such great visibility on revenue as you know because of the business model that we feel comfortable give guidance on q2
but until COVID duration and depth be greater visibility we be not go to have visibility on close new deal at the end of q2 or q3
you next question come from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley
this be Sarah on for Stan
Kind of follow up on you prior comment
in the_past you view growth as be balanced between new logo and add-on sale
and I be wonder to what extent be this still kind of you growth equation
or in reaction to COVID be you see it lean towards one or the other
I really do not see a change there
I think we be still go to see about of add-on sale and new logo
and I think that a lot of the new logo activity or more of it will be in Europe but I still see a lot of new logo activity in North_America as well
so we really think it be go to remain about a clip
get it
and then a quick follow-up
be you see any customer ask to come back and essentially downsize they contract or adjust payment term in reaction to you business react to COVID
yes
we have not see too much of that honestly
we be aware of the we certainly watch we renewal activity and track who be in what industry that might be affect
but so far that have not be a big issue
we next question be from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel
glad to hear you guy be both do well and the team be stay as healthy as it can be
so it be a great start with where we be at right_now
I would love to chat a little bit more I apologize I have a little trouble get in the call
so you may have address it in the first few minute Marty
but relative to the european expansion plan opportunity be still there
I be guess you effort at hire people and look at potential m&a target with you solid balance_sheet I be guess that be probably be push back a little bit
but perhaps you can go into a little bit more detail about how you be tactically able to proceed in a area where you do not perhaps have as many boot on the ground as you want you be look to hire
how much do that sort of set you back from a timing standpoint
and what be the urgency of customer over there to move forward with digital transformation in light of January 15 , 2021 mandate
well yes several aspect
first off the yes the m&a activity have definitely slow
and as I have always say we be go to be very careful do acquisition to make sure we get something that check most of the box we be concern about but that have slow
I would say that we ability to recruit people in EMEA have not change that much
we be find that we have be able to continue to recruit salespeople and the delivery people quite effectively there
we be a little bit behind but it really be not a covid thing
it be we EMEA team be very thorough when they hire and they have get a very good track record of hire good talent and have very low attrition
so I would say it be more about they be more careful and make sure we have the best people possible
and then in term of we growth strategy we be continue in EMEA
we have not slow that at all and we be see good reception from the customer
it be quite amazing and we pipeline be grow at the exact rate we anticipate
so we be pretty please with emea and we be go to continue to expand there
it be really greenfield for we in many way
it be really greenfield in term of how late we go into EMEA
yes
Perfect
get it
and then now that you have fully lap the SBL impact in the model and maybe more importantly you have get you customer up on this sort of all-you-can-eat plan
how do that sort of roll through the way you think about churn
I mean customer now that they be sort of on this all you-can-eat that would not seem like even if they have fewer employee the number of seat they would utilize would go down
so I guess churn would be expose to the usual suspect of bankruptcy and m&a and some of the thing that Stuart talk about
but can you just sort of talk through churn as a concept go forward and how that might differ from the_past with you all you customer on SBL now
well I go out of limb I do not think SBL really affect churn
I think what be happen be we have give customer as we talk about before the customer be always limit by the number of seat they have and they would make careful decision on when they would expand
I think a lot of customer have expand a number of seat
we have see the number of user go substantially higher since we enact SBL
so it make it more sticky in general
I really have not see a decline of end user and maybe that be something that will come as COVID go through its life cycle here
but remember we do stuff that be regulatory in general and stuff that be downstream in the reporting process
and it be really mission-critical or it be require by the government
so we churn I be glad we be talk about this a lot because that be probably the thing that be we be most proud of be we have a very low churn rate and that just induce incredible stability in we financial model
so I be really not that concerned about churn from a sbl point of view and I do not think company that be go to stay in business be go to look at we any differently after COVID
you have a question from the line of Mike Grondahl with Northland Capital
this be Michael on for Mike
maybe just one quick one on the FERC announcement yesterday
can you give we a rough idea of just the number of logo in that space
it be about be not it Marty
yes
I think it be roughly somewhere in there mostly good-sized company
and so and like we say in the press_release a lot of they we customer already ready and they have be bug we about whether we be go to do this
what we be find be customer see more and more xbrl come
it be come all over the world for all the regulatory agency slowly but surely
and these we customer want we standardize on one platform to do all they xbrl
so a lot of we SEC customer be pester we about this and we really do not want to commit to it until FERC put out they taxonomy which happen a couple of month ago
and then we go through the due diligence of understand how it would affect we product and we go-to-market
but we be really well positioned as we say in the press_release to take a significant amount of that market
and there be no other question at this time
Great
well thank you everybody
we appreciate it
yes I think we be do Adam
thank you
thank you again for join today 's conference_call
you may now disconnect
